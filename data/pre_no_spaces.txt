Summoned to court to answer for 

the crime of your bannerman  

Gregor Clegane  The Mountain. 

Arrive within a fortnight 

or be branded an enemy of the crown. 

Poor Ned Stark. Brave man  

terrible judgement. 

Attacking him was stupid. 

Lannister... 

don t act like fools. 

You re gonna say 

something clever  

Go on  say something clever. 

Catelyn Stark took my brother. 

Why is he still alive  

Tyrion  

Ned Stark. 

One of our men interfered... 

speared him through the leg  

before I could finish him. 

Why is he still alive  

It wouldn t have been clean. 

Clean  

You spent too much time 

worrying about what other people think of you. 

I could care less what 

what anyone thinks of me. 

That s what you want people 

to think of you. 

It s the truth. 

And you hear them whispering  Kingslayer  

behind your back  doesn t it bother you  

Of course it bothers me. 

A lion doesn t concern himself 

with the opinion of a sheep. 

I suppose I should be grateful 

that your varity  

got in a way of your reckelessnes. 

I m giving you half of our forces. 

. men. 

And we ll bring that to 

Catelyn Stark girlhood home... 

and remind her that Lannisters 

pay their debts 

I didn t realize you place such 

a high value on my brother s life. 

He s a Lannister. 

Maybe the lowest of the Lannister  

but he s one of us. 

And everyday that he remain a prisoner 

the less our name command respect. 

  So the lion does concern himself with the opinion... 

  No  that s not an opinion  it s a fact. 

If another house can seize 

one of our own 

and hold him captive  with impunity... 

we are no longer house to be feared. 

Your mother is dead. 

Before long I ll be dead. 

and you... 

and your brother... 

and your sister and all of her children... 

all of us dead  

all of us rotting underground. 

Is the family name 

that lives on. 

It s all that lives on. 

Not your personal glory 

not your honor... but family. 

You understand  

You re blessed with ability 

that few men possess. 

You re blessed you belong to 

the most powerful family in the kingdom. 

And you still blessed 

with youth. 

And what you ve done 

with this blessing  

You served as the glorified bodyguard 

for two kings.. 

One a mad man  the other are drunk. 

The future of our family will be 

determined in these next few months. 

We could established a dinasty 

that would last a thousand years... 

or we could collapse into nothing. 

As the Targaryen s did. 

I need you to become a man 

you re always meant to be. 

Not next year  not tomorrow... 

Now. 

You re in pain. 

I ve had worse  my lady. 

Perhaps it s time to go hoome. 

The south doesn t seems to agree with you.. 

I knwo the truth Jon Arryn died for.. 

Do you  lord Stark  

Is that why you called me here  

To pose me riddles  

Has he done this before  

Jaime would ve killed him. 

My brother s worth 

a thousand of your friend. 

Your brother... 

or your lover  

Targaryens wed brothers and sisters 

for  years.. 

to keep bloodlines pure. 

Jaime and I are more than 

brother and sister. 

We shared a womb. 

Came to this world together  

we belong together. 

My son saw you with him. 

  Do you love your children  

  With all my heart. 

  No more than I love mine. 

  And they re all Jaime s. 

Thank the Gods. 

In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores 

for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed  

I finished him off another ways 

  In the morning he doesn t remember. 

  You ve always hated him. 

Hated him  

I worshipped him. 

Every girl in the southern kingdom 

dreamt of him but he was mine by oath. 

And when I finally saw him on our wedding day 

in the Sept of Baelor. 

lean and fierce  and black beared 

it was the happiest moment of my life. 

And that night he crawl on top of me  

stinking of wine 

and did what he did what little he could do 

and whispered in my ear    Lyanna . 

Your sister was a corpse 

and I was a living girl 

and he loved her more than me. 

When the king return from his hunts  

I ll tell him the truth. 

You must be gone by then... 

you and your children. 

I will not have that blood on my hands. 

Go as far away as you can.. 

With as many men as you can. 

Because wherever you go... 

Robert s wrath will follow you. 

And what of my wrath  lord Stark  

You should have taken the realm 

for yourself. 

Jaime told me about the day 

King s Landing fell. 

He was sitting in the Iron Throne 

and you made him give it up. 

All you needed to do is claim the step 

yourself. Such a sad mistake. 

I ve made many mistakes in my life.. 

but that wasn t one of them. 

Oh  but it was. 

When you play the game of thrones  

you win or you die. 

There is no middle ground. 

No  No  No  No.. 

is that what they teach you 

up in the North  

And you  wherever you re from. 

Do you have any idea 

how ridiculous you sound  

Either of you understand the thing that I m saying  

Yes  my lord. 

Lets start over. Shall we  

You be the man  and you be the woman. 

Go ahead. 

Slowly. 

You re not fooling them  

they just paid you  they know what you are. 

They know its all just an act 

Your job is to make them 

forget what they know. 

And that takes time. 

You need to.. 

ease into it. 

Go ahead. 

Ease into it. 

He s winding you over  

inspite of yourself. 

You starting to like this. 

He wants to believe you. 

He s enjoyed his cock since he was old enough 

to play with a boy  shouldn t you  

He knows  he s better than other men. 

He s always known it deep down inside 

now he has proof. 

He s so good... 

he s reaching something deep inside of you 

that no one even knew was there. 

Overcoming your very nature.. 

Why don t you join us  my lord  

I m saving myself for another. 

What she doesn t know 

will not hurt her  

A stupid saying.. 

What we don t know is usually 

what get us killed. 

She must be very beautiful. 

No  not really. 

Impeccable bloodlines  though. 

I do believe my lord in love. 

For many years. 

Most of my life really. 

Play with her ass. 

And she loved me too. 

I was her little confidant. 

A play thing. She could tell me anything  

anything at all. 

She told me about 

all the horses that she liked. 

The castle that she want to live in. 

The man that she wanted to marry. 

A northener.. 

with a jaw like an anvil. 

So I challenged him to a duel. I mean  

why not  I d read all the stories. 

The little hero always beats 

the big villain in all the stories. 

In the end... 

she wouldn t even let him kill me. 

 He s just a boy   she said. 

 Please don t hurt him . 

So he gave me a nice little scar to remember 

and by enough they went 

  And she still married to him  

  Oh  no. 

He got himself killed before the wedding. 

And she ended up with his brother  

an even more impressive spciment. 

She love him  I m afraid. 

And why wouldn t she  I mean  

Who could compare to him  

he just so... 

good. 

Do you know what I learned 

losing that duel  

I learned that I ll never win. 

Not that way. 

That s their game. 

Their rules. 

I m not going to fight them. 

I m going to fuck them. 

That s what I know  that s what I am. 

And only by admitting what we are  

can we get what we want. 

And what do you want  

Oh  everything  my dear. 

Everything there is. 

Now wash yourself  

both of you are working tonight. 

You re very lucky girl  

do you know that  

Where I come from we don t show mercy 

to criminals. 

Where I come from  

if someone like you attacked a little lord.. 

the low tide will lay you on your back  

on the beach.. 

your hands and feet chained to four stakes.. 

sea will coming cloaser and closer. 

You ll see death creeping toward you  

a few inches at a time. 

Where do you come from  

The Iron Islands. 

They far away  

You ve never heard of the Iron Islands  

Trust me  you ve never heard 

where I m from neither. 

Trust me  my lord. 

You re not living in the wilderness anymore. 

In civilised land  you advert 

your betters by their proper titles. 

And what s that  

Lord. 

Why  

Why  

What do you mean  why   

My father is Balon Greyjoy  

lord of the Iron Islands. 

What s that got to do with you  

Your father s lord  

how can you be lord too  

  I will be lord after my father.. 

  So you re not lord now. 

No  you... 

You having a go at me  

Is that it  

Just don t understand 

how you southerner do things. 

I m not a southerner. 

You re from south of The Wall... 

that make you southerner to me. 

You re an impudent little wench  

aren t you  

Couldn t say  my lord. 

Didn t know what impunent means. 

Impudent. It means rude. 

Disrespectful. 

Do you want to loose that chain  

Theon Greyjoy  

The lady is our guest. 

Thought she was our prisoner. 

Are the two mutually exclusive  

in your experience  

Chances are I won t be nearby  

the next time that happens. 

I m used to worst than him. 

I m used to men 

that can chew that boy up. 

And pick their teeth with his bones. 

Why did you come here  

Didn t mean to come here. 

Meant to get much further south 

than this. As far as south as south goes. 

Before the long night comes. 

Why  

What do you afraid of  

Those thing that sleep in the day 

and hunt at night 

  Owl and shadowcats... 

  I m not talking about owl and shadowcats. 

The thing you speak of.. 

have been gone for thousand of years. 

It wasn t gone  old man. 

They were sleeping. 

And they re sleeping no more. 

I missed girls. 

Not even talking to them  

I never talk to them. 

Just lookin  at them. 

Hearing them giggle. 

Don t you missed girls  

Riders  

The horn. We have to blow the horn. 

Why is he alone  

One blast for a ranger returning 

Two for wildlings 

  Three.. 

  He s no rider. 

That s my uncle Benjen rode.. 

where s my uncle  

Ned  

Robert... 

we are hunting... a boar... 

I should have spent more time with you. 

Shown to you how to be a man. 

I was never meant to be a father. 

Go on.... 

you don t want to see this. 

My fault.. 

Too much wine.. 

Missed my thrust.. 

Stinks. 

Stinks like death. 

Don t think I can t smell it. 

Pay the bastard back  Ned. 

I drove my knife 

right through his brain 

You ask him if I didn t. Ask him  

I want the funeral feast to be the biggest 

the kingdom ever saw.. 

And I want everyone 

to taste the boar that got me 

Now leave us  the lot of you 

I need to talk to Ned. 

  Robert  my sweet... 

  Out  All of you  

You damn fool. 

Paper and ink. On the table. 

Write down what I said. 

In the name of Robert 

of the House Baratheon 

First of... you know how it goes. 

Put in the damn titles.. 

I hereby command.. 

Eddard of House Stark... 

titles..titles... 

to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of The Realm  upon my death.. 

to rule in my stead.. 

until my son Joffrey comes of age. 

Give it over.. 

Give it to the council.. 

after I m death. 

At least they ll say I did this right  this one thing. 

You ll rule now. 

You ll hate it worse than I did.. 

but you ll do it well. 

The girl.. 

Daenerys... 

you re right. 

Varys  Littlefinger  my brother.. 

Worthless.. 

Noone to tell me  No  but you. 

Only you. 

Let her live 

  Stop it if its not to late. 

  I will. 

My son... 

help him  Ned. 

Make him better than me 

I ll... 

I ll do everything I can 

to honor your memory. 

My memory  

King Robert Baratheon... 

murdered by a pig. 

Give me something to the pain  

and let me die. 

Give him milk of the poppy. 

He was reeling from the wine.. 

He commanded us to... 

step aside  but... 

I failed him. 

No men could ve protected him from himself. 

I wonder  Ser Barristan  

who gave the King this wine  

His squire. 

From the King s own skin. 

His squire  The Lannister boy  

Such a dutiful boy to make sure 

His Grace did not lack refreshment. 

I do hope the poor lad 

is not blame himself. 

His Grace has had a change of heart 

concerning Daenerys Targaryen. 

Whatever arrangements you made... 

unmade them  at once. 

I m afraid those birds have flown. 

The Khaleesi likely dead already. 

Can you help me make him.. understand  

The Dothraki do things on their own time 

for their own reason 

Have patience  Khaleesi. We will 

go home  I promise you. 

My brother... 

was a fool  I know.. but he was 

the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. 

Have I said something funny  ser  

Forgive me  khaleesi  but your ancestor  

Aegon The Conqueror  

didn t seize six of the kingdoms 

because it his right. 

He have no right to them  

he seized them because he could. 

And because he had dragons. 

Having few dragons makes things easier. 

  You don t believe it  

  Have you ever seen a dragon  khaleesi  

I believe what my eyes and ears report. 

As for the rest  it was  years ago  

who knows what really happened. 

Now if you pardon me  

I ll seek out the merchant captain.. 

  see if he has any letter for me. 

  Well  I ll come with you. 

No  no  don t trouble yourself. 

Enjoy the market. 

I ll rejoin you soon enough. 

Jorah  the Andal  

The Spider sent his greetings 

and his congratulations. 

Overall pardon  

you can go home now. 

My son already has his name  but I ll 

try your summer wine. Just a taste. 

My lady  you are from Westeros  

You have the honor of addressing 

Daenerys of the House Targaryen. 

Khaleesi of the riding men  

and princess of the Seven Kingdoms. 

  Princess. 

  Rise. 

I still like to taste that wine. 

That  

Dorne s sweet not worthy of a princess. 

I have the dry red from the Arbor. 

Nectar of the Gods. 

Let me give you a cask. 

  A gift  

  You honor me  ser. 

The honor.. the honor is all mine. 

You know there are many in your homeland 

that pray for your return  princess. 

I hope to repay your kindness someday. 

The wine is for the Khaleesi  

it s not for the likes of you. 

Open it. 

Pour. 

It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich 

without at least giving it time to breathe. 

Do as he says. 

As the princess command. 

Sweet  isn t it  

Can you smell the fruit  ser  

Taste it  my lord. 

Tell me that is not the finest wine 

that has ever touch your tongue. 

You first. 

Me  

I m afraid I m not worthy of the vintage. 

Beside  is it a poor wine merchant 

who drink up his own wares 

You will drink. 

Come. 

You came to us as outlaws.. 

poachers.. 

rapers.. 

killers  thieves... 

You came alone.. 

in chains.. 

without friends  or honor. 

You came to us rich.. 

or you came to us poor. 

Some of you bear the name 

of proud houses.. 

all those only bastard names  

or no names at all. 

It does not matter. 

All that  is in the past. 

Here.. 

on the Wall. 

we re all one house. 

Tonight.. 

We re allowed to look happy.. 

you re going to be a ranger. 

It s not what you always wanted  

I want to find my uncle. 

I know he s alive out there. 

I know he is. 

I wish I could help you  

but I m no ranger. 

its the steward s life for me. 

You re honored being a steward. 

Not much  really. 

But those food. 

You begin a new. 

A man of the Night s Watch. 

live his life for the realm. 

Not for King 

or a Lord.. 

or the honor of this house or that house. 

Not for gold  glory .. 

or women s love. 

But for the realm.. 

and all the people in it. 

You all learned the words  your vow 

Think carefully before you say them. 

The penalty for desertion.. 

is death. 

You can take your vows here.. 

tonight.. 

at sunset. 

Do any of you still keep the Old Gods  

I do  my lord. 

Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree   

as your uncle did  

Yes  my lord. 

You ll find the weirwoods  

a mile north of the Wall.. 

and your Old  Gods too  maybe. 

My Lord  

Might I go as well  

Is House Tarly keep the Old Gods  

No  my lord.. 

I was name in the light of the Seven.. 

as my father was 

and his father before him. 

Why would you forsake   

the Gods of your father and your house  

The Night s Watch is my house now. 

The Seven have never answer my prayers.. 

perhaps the Old Gods will. 

As you wish. 

You all been  

assigned an order.. 

according to our needs.. 

and your strength. 

Halder  builders. 

Pyp  to the stewards. 

Tod  to the builders. 

Grenn  to the rangers.

Matthar  to the rangers. 

Dareon  to the stewards.

Eskan  to the rangers. 

Albett  to the builders   

Jorden to the stables. 

Mikken  to the cooks. 

Halor  to the builders. 

Delugo  to the rangers. 

May all the Gods preserve you. 

Rangers  with me. 

Builders  

Samwell... 

you will assisst me in the rookery  

and the library. 

Pyp... 

you will report to Bowen Marsh   

in the kitchen. 

Luke  report to One Eye Joe in the stable.. 

Dareon  I m sending you to the east watch.. 

present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.. 

Make no comment about his nose. 

Jon Snow... 

Lord Commander Mormont has requested you  

for his personal steward. 

Will I serve the Lord Commander s meal  

and fetch hot water for his bath  

Certainly. 

And keep the fire burning in his chambers.. 

change his sheets  

and blankets daily.. 

and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you. 

You take me for a servant  

We took you for a man of the Night s Watch. 

But perhaps we were wrong in that. 

May I go  

As you wish. 

Jon  Wait  

  Don t you see what they re doing  

  I see ser Alliser revenge thats all.. 

he wanted it and he got it. 

Steward are nothing 

but maid  

I m a better swordman and rider than any of you  

It s not fair  

Fair  

I was singing for a high lord  

at Acorn Hall  

when he put his hand in my leg  

and he wanted to see my cock. 

I pushed him away and he said.. 

he d have my hand cut off  

for stealing when he s over. 

So now I m here  

at the end of the world  

where noone to sing a folk  

but old men and little shit like you. 

I ll never see my family again. 

I ll never been inside a women again. 

Don t tell me about fair. 

I thought you were caught stealing  

a wheel of cheese.. 

for your starving sister. 

Course who s gonna teel a bunch of strangers.. 

a high lord try to grab my cock  

Could you sing me a song  Pyp  

I d like to hear a song. 

Now listen to me.. 

the old man  is the Lord Commander  

of The Night s Watch. 

You will be with him  day and night  

yes.. you will clean his clothes. 

You will also  take his letters.. 

attend him at meeting   

squire for him at battle. 

You ll know everything   

be part of everything. 

And he ask for you himself. 

He wants to groom you for command. 

I just... 

I always wanted to be a ranger. 

I always wanted to be a wizard. 

What  

No  I m serious. 

So you ll stay and say your word with me  

Lord Stark. 

A moment  

Alone  if you will. 

He name you Protector of The Realm. 

He did. 

She won t care. 

Give me an hour and I ll put  

a hundred of swords at your command. 

  And what should I do with a hundred swords  

  Strike  

Tonight  while the castle sleeps. 

We must get Joffrey away from his mother  

and into our custody. 

Protector of The Realm or no   

he who holds the king holds the kingdom. 

Every moment you delay   

gives Cersei another moment to prepare. 

By the time Robert die  

it would be late for the both of us. 

What about Stannis  

Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei  

and delivering him to Stannis  

You have odd notion about  

 protecting the realm . 

Stannis is your older brother. 

This isn t about the bloody line of succession. 

That didn t matter when you rebelled  

against the Mad King.. 

it shouldn t matter now. 

What s the best for the kingdoms  

What s best for the people we rule  

We all know what Stannis is.. 

He inspires no love  or loyalty. 

He s not a king. 

I am. 

Stannis is a commander. 

He s led men into war  twice. 

  He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet. 

  Yes. he s a good soldier  everyone knows that. 

so is Robert. 

Tell me something. Do you still believe 

good soldier made good king  

I will not dishonor Robert s last hour  

by shedding blood in his house.. 

and dragging frightened children  

from their beds. 

You will sail to Dragonstone tonight. 

You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. 

Not his steward. 

Not his captain of the guard. 

And not his wife. 

Only Stannis himself. 

Yes  my lord. 

Now leave us. 

My lord protector. 

The king has no trueborn son. 

Joffrey and Tommen  are Jaime Lannister s bastards. 

  So when the king dies.. 

  The throne passes to his brother.. 

Lord Stannis. 

So it would seem. 

  Unless.. 

  There is no  unless   

He is the rightful heir. 

Nothing can change that. 

And he cannot take the throne 

without your help. 

You would be wise to denied to him. 

And to make sure Joffrey succeeds. 

Do you have a shred of honor  

You re now Hand of The King  

and Protector of The Realm  

all the power is yours  you need only.. 

reach out and take it. 

Make peace with the Lannisters. 

Release The Imp. 

Wed your daughter to Joffrey. 

We ve plenty of time  

to get rid of Stannis.. 

and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems  

when he come into his throne.. 

we simply reveal his little secret.. 

  and sit Lord Renly there instead. 

  We  

You ll need someone to share this burdens  

I assure you.. 

my price would be modest. 

Would you suggest this treason  

Only if we lose. 

Make peace with the Lannisters you say.. 

The people who tried to murder my boy. 

We only make peace with our enemy  my lord. 

That s why its called making peace. 

No... 

I won t do it. 

  So it will be Stannis  and war  

  There is no other choice. 

He is the heir. 

So why did you call me here  

Not for my wisdom clearly. 

You promised Catelyn 

you would help me. 

The queen had a dozen knights  

and hundred man at arms. 

Enough to overwhelm what remain  

of my household guard. 

I need the Gold Cloaks. 

The City Watch is two thousand strong. 

and sworn to defend the king s peace. 

Look at you. 

You know what you want me to do. 

You know it has to be done. 

But it s not honorable  so... 

the words stick in your throat. 

When the Queen proclaims one king  

and the Hand proclaim another.. 

who s peace to the Gold Cloaks protect  

Who do they follow  

The man who pays them. 

Hear my words   

and bear witness to my vow 

Night gathers  and now my watch begins. 

It shall not end until my death. 

I shall take no wife  hold no lands  father no children. 

I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. 

I shall live and die at my post. 

 I am the sword in the darkness. 

 I am the watcher on the walls. 

I am the shield that guards the realm of men. 

I pledge my life and honor to the Night s Watch  

 for this night and all the nights to come. 

You knelt as boys.. 

rise now as men  

of the Night s Watch. 

Welcome.. Welcome.. 

What he s got there  

To me  Ghost. 

Bring it here. 

Gods be good. 

What will they do to him  

When the khalasar rides.. 

he ll be leashed to the saddle and forced  

to run behind the horses  as long as he can. 

And when he falls  

I saw a man last nine miles once. 

King Robert still wants me dead. 

This poisoner was the first   

he won t be the last. 

I thought he d leave me alone  

now that my brother is gone. 

He will never leave you alone. 

If you ride to Asshai   

his assassins will follow you. 

If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle  

his spy would tell him. 

He will never abandon the hunt. 

You are Targaryen. 

The last Targaryen. 

Your son will have Targaryen blood.. 

with . riders behind him. 

He will not have my son. 

He will not have you either  khaleesi. 

Lord Stark  

  Stop  

  It s alright. 

  It s alright. Let him through. 

  Lord Stark... 

King Joffrey and the queen regent 

request you presence in the throne room. 

King Joffrey  

King Robert is gone. 

The Gods give him rest. 

All is accomplished. 

The City Watch is youts. 

Good. 

Is Lord Renly joining us  

I fear Lord Renly 

has left the city. 

He rode through the Old Gate 

an hour before dawn.. 

with ser Loras Tyrell 

and some fifty retainers. 

Last seen galloping south in some haste. 

We stand behind you  lord Stark. 

All hail His Grace   

Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister. 

The First of His Name  

The King of The Andal  and The First Men.. 

Lord of The Seven Kingdoms 

and Protector of The Realm. 

I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation. 

I wish to be crowned within the forthnight. 

Today I shall accept oaths of fealty 

from my loyal councillors. 

Ser Barristan... 

I believe no men here  

could ever question your honor. 

King Robert seal. 

Unbroken. 

Lord Eddard Stark is herein named.. 

Protector of The Realm.. 

to rule as regent... 

until the heir come of age. 

May I see that letter  ser Barristan  

Protector of The Realm. 

Is this meant to be your shield  

Lord Stark  

A piece of paper. 

Those were the king s words. 

We have a new king now. 

Lord Eddard  when we last spoke 

you offer me some counsel. 

Allow me to return the courtesy. 

Bend the knee  my lord. 

Bend the knee  

and swear loyalty to my son. 

And we shall allow you to live out the days 

in the grey waste.. 

you called home. 

Your son has no claim to the throne. 

Liar  

You condemn yourself  

with your own mouth  Lord Stark. 

Ser Barristan  seize this traitor. 

Ser Barristan is a good man   

a loyal man  do him no harm. 

You think you stands alone  

Kill him  Kill all of them. 

I commanded. 

Commander  

Take the queen and  

her children to custody. 

Escort them back to the royal apartment  

and keep them there under guard. 

Men of the watch  

I want no bloodshed. 

Tell your men to lay down their swords  

noone needs to die. 

Now  

I did warn you not to trust me. 

 i  From this time  i  

 i until the end of time   i  

we are the free and independent 

Kingdom of the North.  

You ll give the Starks 

our reply  cousin  

I will  Your Grace. 

Did you see my brother when you 

were the Starks  guest  

I did. 

Tell him he s not 

been forgotten. 

  Grunts   

  Panting   

I ll do it. 

Come  brothers. 

We ll leave him to it. 

Be quick about it. 

    Grunts   

    Sword clangs   

I ve yielded Winterfell 

to Prince Theon. 

All of you should do 

as he commands. 

Betray me and you will 

wish you hadn t. 

Man  

 i All hail the king.  i  

    Groans   

    Crowd murmuring   

  Who threw that  

    Crowd shouting   

Get back  

  Whimpering   

You re all right now  little bird. 

You re all right. 

Your brothers desert you  

  We ll stop here. 

  Think they re out looking for you  

Yes. 

  Grunts   

What might this be  

Let s go. 

Amory Lorch. 

Now  

A man will do 

what must be done. 

 i Guard   i  

I have something for you 

from Prince Theon. 

  Gurgles   

When I came to this city  

I had nothing. 

Today I am the richest 

man in Qarth 

with no regrets. 

Where are they  

Where are my dragons

The giant must have

Oh  well  

that s all right  then. 

You let a halfwit

  Grunting

Right  get the horses 

and the hounds. 

    Dogs barking   

  Come on  find the scent. 

Come on  

where they going  

Halt  

Enjoying 

your first hunt  

So far  hunting seems very similar 

to riding  My Lord. 

With hunting  

there s blood at the end. 

They re little boys. 

I was a little boy 

when I was torn away from 

my home and brought here. 

So I kept my word. 

I never ran away. 

If I find them soon enough  

I won t hurt them. 

Well  I ll hurt them  

but I won t kill them. 

Those boys are of far more value 

to you alive than dead. 

They have no value 

to me missing. 

Robb will have sent a force 

to retake Winterfell by now. 

Robb s in the Riverlands. 

My sister s in Deepwood Motte. 

 i She ll get here  i  

 i long before they do.  i  

And Ned Stark always 

said  men could hold 

Winterfell against  . 

   i   Dogs barking    i  

  Man   i We have a scent   i  

The hounds have the scent. 

Come  Maester  

don t look so grim. 

It s all just a game. 

Osha  We should have 

took more food. 

We couldn t risk 

going to the kitchens. 

Those people 

all love you. 

They would have given 

you whatever you needed. 

And if Theon found out  

he d hang them. 

  The boy can t survive on walnuts. 

  I m fine. 

We ve been walking 

since before sunrise. 

  Even Hodor will tire. 

  Hodor. 

  Even you  sweet giant. 

    Chuckles   Hodor. 

 i   Children shouting    i  

Wait  I know that farm. 

 i I sent those two  i  

 i Winterfell orphans there.  i  

Jack and Billy. 

They ll give us some food. 

We can t risk it. 

If Theon tracks us here  

he ll torture them 

until he finds out 

where we are. 

Billy climbs a tree 

better than anyone. 

You ve never seen me 

climb a tree  little man. 

 i They ll be after us  i  

 i with hounds.  i  

 i We got a good start  i  

 i on them   i  

but we can t outrun 

hounds forever. 

Did you pull a knife 

on me in the night  

What s the matter  

Can t be the first time 

you pressed your bone 

against a woman s ass. 

Let s move. 

Oh  it is 

the first time. 

How old are you  boy  

I m a man 

of the Night s Watch. 

You re a boy who s 

never been with a girl. 

Don t your stones 

start to hurt 

if your bone 

never gets   

Don t call them that. 

What  stones  

Or bone  

Neither. 

Both. 

Move  

Ygritte  I heard they get 

all swollen 

and bruised if you 

don t use them. 

Of course  maybe that s 

just what the lads say 

when they want me 

feeling sorry for them. 

As if I d feel 

sorry for them. 

Are there 

no girl crows  

There are no women 

of the Night s Watch  no. 

So the lads just do it 

with each other  

No. 

  Never  

  Never. 

We swore an oath. 

You have sheep 

at the Wall  

With your hands  then  

No wonder 

you re all so miserable. 

Would you please shut up  

  Mocking   

Would you please shut up  

You think you re 

better than me  crow. 

  I m a free woman   

  You re a free woman  

I might be your prisoner  

but I m a free woman. 

If you re my prisoner  

you re not a free woman. 

That s what 

 prisoner  means. 

And you think you re free  

You swore 

some stupid oath 

and now you can never 

touch a girl. 

It was my choice 

to say the words. 

  So you don t like girls  

  Of course I like girls. 

But you chose 

never to touch them. 

That s the price you pay if you want 

to be a man of the Night s Watch. 

So instead of getting 

naked with a girl  

you d prefer 

to invade our lands   

Invade your lands  

Wildlings raid 

our lands all the time. 

Some of them tried to kill my 

little brother  a crippled boy  

They re not your lands  

We ve been here 

the whole time. 

You lot came along 

and just put up a big wall 

and said it was yours. 

My father was Ned Stark. 

I have the blood 

of the First Men. 

My ancestors lived here  

same as yours. 

So why are you 

fighting us  

Go on. 

Now I want you 

to tell me what happened. 

  Guard   i Come on  this way.  i  

   i   Man screaming    i  

 i Come on  speak up.  i  

 i Speak up.  i  

  Sniffs   

Wolfsbane   

a rare substance. 

This is no common assassin. 

We hanged  men 

last night. 

I don t care 

if you hanged . 

A man tried to kill me. 

I want his name 

and I want his head. 

Mountain   i We think it was  i  

 i an infiltrator  i  

from the Brotherhood 

Without Banners. 

Pretentious name 

for a band of outlaws. 

We can t allow rebels 

behind our lines 

to harass us 

with impunity. 

We look like fools 

and they look like heroes. 

 i That s how kings fall.  i  

I want them dead  

every one. 

Killing them 

isn t the problem. 

 i It s finding them.  i  

Have you gone soft  

Clegane  

I always thought you had 

a talent for violence. 

Burn the villages  

burn the farms. 

Let them know what it means 

to choose the wrong side. 

Mmm. 

Is that mutton  

Yes  My Lord. 

Don t like mutton. 

I ll bring 

something else. 

Leave it. 

  Are you hungry  

  No. 

Of course you are. 

Eat. 

I ll eat 

in the kitchen later. 

It s bad manners 

to refuse a Lord s offer. 

Sit. 

Eat. 

You re small for your age. 

I suppose you ve been 

underfed your whole life. 

I eat a lot. 

   i I just don t grow.  i  

  Hmm. 

This will be my last war  

win or lose. 

Have you ever 

lost before  

Do you think I d be in my position 

if I had lost a war  

But this is the one 

I ll be remembered for. 

 i The  War of Five Kings   i  

 i they re calling it.  i  

My legacy will be determined 

in the coming months. 

Do you know 

what legacy means  

It s what you pass down 

to your children 

and your children s 

children. 

It s what remains of you 

when you re gone. 

Harren the Black thought this castle 

would be his legacy. 

The greatest fortress 

ever built   

the tallest towers  

the strongest walls. 

The Great Hall 

had  hearths. 

. Can you imagine  

Look at it now   

 i a blasted ruin.  i  

Do you know 

what happened  

Dragons  

Yes  dragons happened. 

Harrenhal was built to withstand 

an attack from the land. 

A million men could have marched 

on these walls 

and a million men 

would have been repelled. 

But an attack from the air 

with dragon fire   mm. 

Harren and all his sons 

roasted alive within these walls. 

Aegon Targaryen 

changed the rules. 

That s why every child alive 

still knows his name 

 years after his death. 

Aegon and his sisters. 

Mm  

It wasn t just Aegon 

riding his dragon. 

It was Rhaenys 

and Visenya  too. 

Correct. 

A student of history  

are you  

Rhaenys rode Meraxes. 

Visenya rode Vhagar. 

I m sure I knew that 

when I was a boy. 

Visenya Targaryen 

was a great warrior. 

She had a Valyrian steel sword 

she called Dark Sister. 

Hmm. 

She s a heroine 

of yours  I take it  

Aren t most girls 

more interested 

in the pretty maidens 

from the songs  

 i Jonquil with the flowers  i  

 i in her hair   i  

  Most girls are idiots. 

   i Ha   i  

You remind me 

of my daughter. 

Where did you learn 

all this stuff 

about Visenya and her 

Valyrian Steel sword  

From my father. 

He was a well read 

stonemason. 

Can t say I ve ever met 

a literate stonemason. 

Have you met many 

stonemasons  My Lord  

Careful now  girl. 

 i I enjoy you   i  

 i but be careful.  i  

Take that back 

to the kitchen. 

Eat what you want. 

And  girl. 

M lord. 

Lowborn girls 

say  M lord   

 i not  My Lord.   i  

If you re going 

to pose as a commoner  

you should do it 

properly. 

My mother served 

Lady Dustin 

for many years  

My Lord. 

She taught me how to speak 

proper   properly. 

You re too smart 

for your own good. 

   i Has anyone told you that   i  

  Yes. 

Go on. 

I beg pardon  Ser. 

I should have 

come to you after 

to thank you 

for saving me. 

  You were so brave. 

  Brave  

A dog doesn t need courage 

to chase off rats. 

Does it give you joy 

to scare people  

No. It gives me joy 

to kill people. 

Spare me. 

You can t tell me 

Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell 

never killed a man. 

It was his duty. 

He never liked it. 

Is that what he told you  

He lied. 

Killing is the sweetest 

thing there is. 

Why are you always 

so hateful  

You ll be glad 

of the hateful things I do 

someday when you re queen 

and I m all that stands 

between you 

and your beloved king. 

I ve demanded a meeting 

of the Thirteen. 

One of them did this 

or knows who did. 

You are one 

of the Thirteen. 

If I wanted your dragons  

I would have taken them. 

  They mean nothing to me on their own. 

  Nothing  

They re more valuable 

than anything in the world. 

Shall we look inside my vault and see 

what selling your dragons 

would buy me 

I cannot buy already  

We will get them back. 

There is no we  

so why would you help me 

get them back  

I took you 

under my protection 

in front of the rulers 

of my city. 

A man is what others 

say he is and no more. 

If they say that 

Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar  

my word is worth nothing. 

I cannot let this thing 

happen to you under my roof. 

But it did happen 

under your roof. 

Khaleesi  many times 

in my life I have been   

I don t care 

where you ve been. 

You think we re savages because 

we don t live in stone castles. 

We can t make steel as good 

as yours  it s true  but... 

We re free. 

If someone tried to tell us 

we couldn t lie down 

as man and woman  

we d shove a spear 

up his ass. 

We don t go serving 

some shit king 

who s only king 

because his father was. 

No. No  you serve 

Mance Rayder  

the King Beyond the Wall. 

We chose Mance Rayder 

to lead us. 

He was a crow  

same as you  

but he wanted 

to be free. 

You could be free  too. 

You don t need to live 

your whole life 

taking commands 

from old men. 

Wake up when you want 

to wake up. 

I could show you the streams 

to fish  the woods to hunt. 

 i Build yourself a cabin and find  i  

 i a woman to lie with in the night.  i  

You re a pretty lad. 

The girls would claw each other s 

eyes out to get naked with you. 

Walk. 

I could teach you 

how to do it. 

I know how to do it. 

You know nothing  

Jon Snow. 

  Chatter   

And what did she say  

She admired your spirit  

Your Grace. 

And what then  

She  uh... 

If every man 

were held accountable 

for the actions 

of every distant relative  

Ser Alton  we d all hang. 

She tore the paper 

in half  Your Grace. 

You ve acted with honor. 

I thank you for it. 

Lord Karstark  see that 

Ser Alton s pen is clean. 

And give him a hot supper. 

Ser Alton s pen 

is occupied  Your Grace. 

The prisoners 

from the Yellow Fork. 

Too many prisoners. 

Is there room 

for Ser Alton  

Does he need 

to lie down  

Have the men 

build him a new pen. 

 i Put him in with  i  

 i the Kingslayer for now.  i  

Have your boy 

watch over them. 

Torrhen. 

That will be all. 

Your Grace. 

 i A minute of your time   i  

I ve been treating 

your wounded men. 

And my enemies 

as some of my bannermen 

are fond of mentioning. 

They re not my enemies. 

That s what I tell 

my bannermen. 

I ve already run through the 

supplies I brought with me. 

Some are easily replaced   

egg yolks  turpentine  

oil of roses. 

But some are not. 

I need silk 

for stitching. 

I need fennel root 

for those with fever  willow bark. 

Mostly I need 

milk of the poppy. 

You saw what it was like 

to amputate a foot without any. 

I assume there will be 

more loss of limb before 

this war is over. 

  If you need help finding these   

  I know where to find them. 

I m sorry  I shouldn t 

interrupt you. 

Continue  My Lady. 

You re riding to the Crag 

to negotiate a surrender  

Yes. 

The Crag will have a Maester 

and he will have what I need. 

I expect he will. 

If I could write a list   

come with me 

to the Crag. 

I don t think 

that will be   

Let the Maester 

show you his stores. 

I want the wounded men 

to be treated well   

all the wounded men. 

 i   Dog barking    i  

Woman  

 i Children  come inside  quick.  i  

Hurry up  

   i   Dog barking    i  

  Man   i Can t find anything  Ser.  i  

  They ve lost the scent. 

  Try again. 

We ve circled 

this farmhouse twice. 

There s no sign of them. 

We could start the search fresh 

in the morning  My Lord. 

I m looking at spending 

the rest of life 

being treated like a fool and 

a eunuch by my own people. 

Ask yourself   Is there anything 

I wouldn t do 

to stop that 

from happening   

The hounds will find 

the scent again. 

I ll beat them 

until they do. 

I ll whip every man here 

 i until I have  i  

 i both those boys in hand.  i  

And once I ve got them  

the pampered little shits... 

It s better to be 

cruel than weak. 

Prince Theon. 

  Where are they  

  Who  m lord  

The Stark boys. 

Where are they  

I don t know. 

I seen no one. 

Oh  

Think harder. 

I swear  m lord  

I don t know. 

My Lord  over here. 

I think I ve found 

what we re looking for. 

Send the old man home. 

Go back to Winterfell. 

Take him back. 

Theon  don t do this. 

 i   Birds chirping    i  

You came back. 

As soon as I heard. 

Do you know anything  

  Irri is dead. 

   i I know.  i  

  She was a good   

  she s dead. 

She died alone. 

She died for me 

and I couldn t protect her. 

Doreah  

We can t find her. 

She must be dead  too. 

I led my people 

out of the Red Waste 

and into 

the slaughterhouse. 

I should have been here. 

You went to find me 

a ship. 

My place is by your side. 

I shouldn t have left you 

alone with these people. 

These people  

They are not 

to be trusted. 

And who is to be trusted  

Who are my people  

The Targaryens  

I only knew one   

my brother  

and he would have let 

  men rape me 

if it had got him 

the crown. 

The Dothraki  

Most of them turned on me 

the day that Khal Drogo 

fell from his horse. 

Your people 

are in Westeros. 

The people in Westeros 

don t know I m alive. 

  They will soon enough. 

  And then what  

They ll pray for my return  

They ll wave dragon banners 

and shout my name  

That s what my brother believed 

and he was a fool. 

You are not your brother. 

Trust me  Khaleesi. 

There it is   

 trust me.  

And it s you I should trust  

Ser Jorah  

Only you  

I don t need trust 

any longer. 

I don t want it and I don t have 

room for it. 

You are too young 

to be so   

And you are too familiar. 

Forgive me  Khaleesi. 

No one can survive 

in this world without help. 

No one. 

Let me help you  please. 

Tell me how. 

Find my dragons. 

Ygritte  How long till we get 

back to your crows  

We re close. 

What  a day  

A half day  

You don t know  do you  

  Do you even know where they are  

  We re close. 

What do you think they ll say 

when they hear about you and me  

Nothing happened 

between you and me. 

 I swear it  

old master king crow  Ser  

we were only close 

together for warmth. 

And then I felt it  

right up against 

me backside like a club. 

I can show you the bruise 

on me tailbone. 

And before I knew 

what was where  his   his   

well  it was all out in the open  

all angry as you like. 

And I didn t want to want it  

but  oh  I did  

And he spread me legs 

and   ruined. 

The shame of it. 

Now I can never marry 

a perfumed lord. 

What will me poor 

savage father say   

Turn back around. 

 And I thought that we were done  

but he said  

  deep voice   

 Turn back around.   

  normal voice   

I ll tell you what  Jon Snow  

since it s going to be 

your word against mine  

and since you can t talk 

about it without blushing  

we may as well just. 

What  right here 

in the muck  

I ll keep you 

warm enough. 

Are you that afraid 

of it  

That s enough. 

Oh  it s nice 

and wet and warm. 

Enough 

it don t have teeth. 

All right  

All right. 

Gods  you re dull. 

  Grunting   

 i   Sword rings    i  

 i   Ygritte whistles    i  

Should have took me 

while you had the chance. 

 i   Sansa crying    i  

 i   Sansa crying    i  

 i No  no   i  

    Screams   

    Laughs   

  Screams   

No. Oh  no. 

  Whimpering   

It s all right. 

Give me that. 

If the queen sees I can have 

Joffrey s children now... 

Help me flip it over. 

  Where are you going  

  To tell her Grace. 

You ll say nothing 

to anyone. 

Do you understand  

Your mother might have 

prepared you. 

You flowered  my dear. 

No more. 

My mother told me  but I 

thought it would be different. 

In what way  

I thought 

it would be less   

less messy. 

Wait until you bear 

the child. 

You re a woman now. 

Do you have any idea 

what that means  

I m fit to bear children 

for the king  

A prospect that 

once delighted you   

bringing little princes 

and princesses into the world  

the greatest honor 

for a queen. 

Joffrey has always 

been difficult. 

Even his birth  

I labored a day and a half 

to bring him 

into this world. 

You cannot imagine 

the pain. 

I screamed so loudly  

I was sure 

Robert would hear me 

in the Kingswood. 

His Grace was not 

with you  

Robert was hunting. 

That was his custom. 

Whenever my time was near  

my royal husband 

would flee to the trees 

with his huntsmen 

and his hounds. 

And when he returned  

he would present me 

with some pelts 

or a stag s head  

and I would present him 

with a baby. 

Not that I wanted 

him there  mind you. 

I had Grand Maester Pycelle  

an army of midwives  

and I had my brother. 

When they told Jaime he wasn t 

allowed in the birthing room  

he smiled and asked 

which one of them 

proposed to keep him out. 

Joffrey will show you 

no such devotion. 

You may never 

love the king  

but you will love 

his children. 

I love his Grace 

with all my heart. 

That s so very 

touching to hear. 

Permit me to share 

some womanly wisdom with you 

on this very special day. 

The more people you love  

the weaker you are. 

You ll do things for them that 

you know you shouldn t do. 

You ll act the fool to make them 

happy  to keep them safe. 

Love no one 

but your children. 

On that front  

a mother has no choice. 

But... shouldn t 

I love Joffrey  Your Grace  

You can try  

little dove. 

 i   Chatter    i  

Who did you say 

your mother was again  

Cinda Lannister. 

Is she the fat one  

Well  perhaps she s gotten 

a little larger than she   

No  no. There s only one 

fat Lannister. 

If she was your mother  

you d know it. 

I   I squired 

for you once  you know  

When  

The tournament the day 

of Willem Frey s wedding. 

I went to 

Willem Frey s wedding  

 i You did.  i  

Your squire had gotten 

so drunk the night before that he   

He threw up on his horse 

on the way 

to the tourney grounds. 

  What was his name  

  Bryan. 

  Laughs   

Poor lad. 

That was my brother s doing  

I seem to recall. 

I remember you. 

You had never squired 

for anyone before. 

That s right. 

I ran up and volunteered. 

 Let me  My Lord. 

Let me.  

My father was furious  

afraid I d embarrass 

our family 

in front of  i the  i  family. 

You didn t  though. 

  You really remember  

  Mm. 

You knew when you were needed 

and when to go away. 

It s a rare talent. 

Most of my squires  

they mean well  

but young men with big jobs  

they tend to overdo them. 

Well  when I think 

back to that day   

  hisses   

You were saying  

I   

never mind. 

It s embarrassing. 

More embarrassing 

than being chained to a post 

covered in your own shit  

I remember everything 

about that day   

your helmet  your horse  

the rake line in the dirt 

along the list  

where the sun was 

in the sky 

when you knocked 

Balon Swann from his horse  

and the dent in your shield 

when you handed it back to me. 

I ll remember it all 

until I die. 

That was the best day 

of my life. 

And I remember being on the field 

after it was over. 

All the competitors 

were done. 

I was the last one 

out there. 

And I couldn t leave. 

 i I couldn t bring myself  i  

 i to go and sit with my family  i  

at a table so far 

on the edge of the feast 

you could barely 

even see the bride. 

And I couldn t bear to tell them 

what it had been like squiring for you 

when I knew that they could 

never have the faintest idea 

what I was talking about. 

I understand completely. 

How could you  

S sorry  I   I didn t 

mean to doubt you. 

  It s just that I   

  I was  once. 

I also had to replace someone s 

squire on short notice. 

Which knight was it  

Barristan Selmy. 

The fight against 

the Kingswood outlaws. 

Before your time. 

What was he like  

  Sighs   

He was 

a painter  

a painter 

who only used red. 

I couldn t imagine being 

able to fight like that  

not back then. 

And to help him do that  

to be a part of something 

that perfect... 

I don t need to explain 

how that felt  not to you. 

It s hard to put 

into words. 

It s like stepping 

into a dream 

you ve been dreaming 

for as long as you can remember 

and finding out 

that the dream 

is more real 

than your life. 

Leaving 

that battlefield was 

like being dragged off 

to prison. 

  Did you squire for him again  

  No. 

I didn t have your gift. 

He couldn t take a step 

without stepping on me. 

I was awful  

a complete liability... 

until one of the outlaws 

decided to take on 

a  year old squire. 

It s a good thing 

I am who I am. 

  Chuckles   I d have been useless 

at anything else. 

I m not well suited 

for imprisonment. 

Shocking  I know. 

Some men are. 

Ned Stark   

I imagine he made 

an excellent prisoner 

right up until the end. 

But me  though   

my life has left me 

uniquely unfit 

for constraint. 

Have you thought about...  

Of course. 

  Every day. 

  And  

Good prisoners breed 

good jailers  apparently. 

The Starks 

are very careful. 

But there is a way  

I think. 

It wasn t possible 

until now. 

What is it  

  It s actually quite simple. 

  Well  let me help you. 

You ll only have 

to do one thing. 

Tell me. 

You ll have to die. 

 i   Crunching    i  

  Choking   

  Bone breaks   

 i   Bird screeching    i  

Jorah the Andal. 

This man must sail 

past old Valyria. 

All who travel too close to 

the Doom must have protection. 

I didn t come here 

for lessons. 

No  you came 

for the dragons. 

You have them  

Where are they  

Draw your sword. 

See what your steel 

is worth. 

You want to please 

the Mother of Dragons. 

You love her. 

Where are the dragons  

Will you betray her again  

Jorah the Andal  

Will you betray her again  

Never. 

 i The thief you seek  i  

is with her now. 

Spice King   i I did not leave  i  

 i the comfort of my home  i  

to come to yours 

and be called a thief. 

No one is calling you 

a thief. 

Who is she to accuse us  

Please  

they re my children. 

  I m begging you. 

  Begging us  

It wasn t very long ago 

you were threatening us. 

Without me  

the dragons will die. 

It will be 

for the best. 

 i Your dragons  i  

 i will bring the world  i  

nothing but death 

and misery  my dear. 

If I knew where they were  

I would not tell you. 

Pyat Pree  

 i You are cruel  my friend.  i  

The mother of dragons 

is in the right. 

 i She must be reunited  i  

 i with her babies.  i  

  I will help you  Khaleesi. 

  How  

I will take you 

to the House of the Undying 

where I have put them. 

You have my dragons  

When I learned you were 

coming to our city  

I made an arrangement 

with the King of Qarth. 

  Laughter   

He procured them for me. 

  But there is no King of Qarth. 

  Xaro  There is now. 

That was the other half 

of the arrangement. 

 i You would keep your gates  i  

 i and your minds closed  i  

to everything 

outside your walls  

but Qarth cannot remain 

the greatest city that ever was 

if it refuses to change. 

I will open Qarth 

to the world 

as I have forced it 

to open itself to me. 

Your ambition 

is an inspiration. 

But like all upstarts  

you overreach. 

Three dragons 

the size of cats 

and an alliance 

with a charlatan 

do not make you a king. 

An upstart 

and a charlatan  

 i Empires have been  i  

 i built by less.  i  

Those on the margins 

often come to control the center  

and those in the center 

make room for them  

 i willingly or otherwise.  i  

The Mother of Dragons 

will be with her babies. 

She will give them 

her love 

and they will thrive 

by her side... 

forever. 

A mother should be 

with her children. 

Where will you run to  

Daenerys Stormborn  

Your dragons wait for you 

in the House of the Undying. 

Come see them. 

  Lady Stark  

  No farther. 

Keep your hands 

off me  woman. 

Don t enter without 

an invitation   i man.  i  

Forgive me. 

Lady Stark. 

  Catelyn   i What is it   i  

  They caught the Kingslayer. 

  Men shouting   

  Kill the fucking Kingslayer  

  Hang him  

  Men shouting   

You ll die today. 

Justice for 

the Karstark. 

Gut him  

Get back  

I want his head  

Any man who stands 

between a father 

and his vengeance 

asks for death. 

Lord Karstark  

this man 

is our prisoner. 

This monster 

killed my son. 

And crippled mine. 

He will answer 

for his crimes  

 i I promise you   i  

 i but not here.  i  

I will have his head. 

And if you try and stop me   

You will strike me down  

Have you forgotten me  Ser  

 i I am the widow of your  i  

 i liege Lord Eddark Stark.  i  

I am the mother 

of your king  

  And where is our king now  

  You know very well. 

He has gone to the Crag 

to accept the surrender. 

Aye  gone to the Crag  

but not to negotiate. 

He brought that 

foreign bitch with him. 

How dare you  

Threatening My Lady 

is an act of treason. 

Treason  

How can it be treason 

to kill Lannisters  

I understand 

your grief  My Lord   

better than most 

I understand it   

but in the name of my son  

the King in the North  

stand down. 

When your son returns  

 i I will demand  i  

 i this murderer s head.  i  

Wise men do not 

make demands of kings. 

Fathers who love 

their sons do. 

I will have his head. 

Thank you for fighting 

on my behalf  Lady Stark. 

I would have come 

to your defense  but   

Take him to the stockades. 

Bind him with every chain 

you can find  

You ve become a real she wolf 

in your later years. 

There s not much fish 

left in you. 

And gag him  

Since when do you light 

your own candles  

Since I decided that 

I can t stand to look 

at any of my handmaidens 

for another instant. 

How many times can you 

read one raven scroll  

Stannis Baratheon s fleet 

has been spotted sailing north 

past Tarth    ships. 

  More than we have. 

  Yes  that s more than we have. 

He ll be at our gates 

within five days  

four if he has the wind. 

We have strong  

high walls. 

We ll rain fire 

down on them from above. 

 Rain fire on them 

from above.  

You re quoting father  

aren t you  

Why not  

He has a good mind 

for strategy  doesn t he  

We call it tactics  

not strategy. 

But  yes  he does have 

a good mind for it. 

The best mind  

some would say. 

Sadly  he s not here. 

It s just you  

me  and Joffrey  

the Lord 

of the Seven Kingdoms 

and protector of the realm. 

I m sure you ll make 

a point eventually. 

He needs to start 

acting like a king. 

This war you started 

is coming to our doorstep. 

And if the entire city 

wants Joffrey dead   

I m not the one giving 

the boy whores to abuse. 

I thought the girls 

might help him. 

  Did you  

   i I was wrong.  i  

If we can t 

control him... 

Do you think 

I haven t tried  

He doesn t listen to me. 

It s hard to put 

a leash on a dog 

once you ve put 

a crown on its head. 

I always hoped 

he d be like Jaime. 

He looks like him... 

in a certain light. 

The boy is more 

Robert than Jaime. 

Robert was a drunken fool  

but he didn t enjoy cruelty. 

Sometimes I wonder... 

What  

If this is the price 

for what we ve done  

for our sins. 

Sins  

The Targaryens   

Wed brother and sister 

for hundreds of years  

I know. 

That s what Jaime and I would say to 

each other in our moments of doubt. 

It s what I told Ned Stark when he 

was stupid enough to confront me. 

Half the Targaryens 

went mad  didn t they  

What s the saying  

Every time a Targaryen is born  

the Gods flip a coin. 

You ve beaten the odds. 

Tommen and Myrcella 

are good  decent children  

both of them. 

  Crying   

  Why wait  

  We re sworn to the king. 

  There s not a king. 

  That s treason. 

So is saving 

Lannisters  yeah  

  Back off  you. 

  No  I won t. 

Your son returns 

at dawn  My Lady  

So they say. 

Brienne   i The Kingslayer  i  

 i won t last the night.  i  

 i The more they drink   i  

 i the angrier they ll get.  i  

And when the Karstarks 

draw their swords... 

 i who wants to die  i  

 i defending a Lannister   i  

Come. 

I need to be alone 

with him. 

  My Lady  our orders   

  your orders  which I just gave you  

are to leave me 

alone with him. 

Come to say goodbye  

Lady Stark  

I believe it s my last night 

in this world. 

Is that a woman  

Do you hear them 

out there  

They want your head. 

Well  old Lord Karstark 

doesn t seem to like me. 

You strangled his son 

with your chains. 

Oh  oh. 

Was he the one 

on guard duty  

 i   Sighs    i  

He was in my way. 

Any Knight would have 

done the same. 

You are no Knight. 

You have forsaken 

every vow you ever took. 

So many vows. 

They make you swear 

and swear. 

 i Defend the king   i  

 i obey the king   i  

 i obey your father   i  

protect the innocent  

defend the weak. 

But what if your father 

despises the king  

What if the king 

massacres the innocent  

It s too much. 

No matter what you do  

you re forsaking one vow or another. 

Where did you find 

this beast  

She is a truer Knight 

than you will ever be  

Kingslayer. 

Kingslayer. 

What a king he was. 

 i Here s to Aerys Targaryen   i  

 i the second of his name   i  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms  

Protector of the realm  

and to the sword 

I shoved in his back. 

You are a man 

without honor. 

Do you know 

I ve never been with 

any woman but Cersei  

So in my own way  

I have more honor 

than poor old dead Ned. 

What was the name of that 

bastard so in he fathered  

  Brienne. 

  No  that wasn t it. 

Snow  a bastard 

from the North. 

Now  when   

when good old Ned 

came home with 

some whore s baby  

did you pretend 

to love it  

 i No. You re not very good  i  

 i at pretending.  i  

 i You re an honest woman.  i  

You hated that boy  

didn t you  

 i How could you not  i  

 i hate him   i  

 i The walking   i  

 i talking reminder  i  

that the honorable 

Lord Eddark Stark 

fucked another woman. 

Your sword. 

I told you 

what would happen. 

All of you   

I told you what would happen 

if you served me loyally... 

 i and what would happen  i  

 i if you did not.  i  

What are you doing  

What have you done  

If there s any who still question 

whether your new lord 

means what he says... 

Here is the answer 

to your question. 

 i   Crowd gasps  murmurs    i  

No  

My son  Jorah  fled Westeros. 

He brought dishonor to our house. 

I need to turn this bunch of thieves and 

runaways into men of the Night s Watch. 

And how s this going  Commander Mormont  

I shall have your head  

You re taking us through Valyria. 

The Doom still rules Valyria. 

Stone Men  

Had any touch you  

You  

The Eyrie is mine. 

The last time the Lords of the Eyrie formed 

an alliance with the Lords of the North  

they brought down the greatest 

dynasty this world has ever known. 

Cersei sent for me. 

I expect I ll be a married 

woman by the time you return. 

I hope I can make her happy. 

She suffered enough. 

I ll never hurt her  

All sinners are equal before the Gods. 

What would you say if I told you 

of a great sinner in our very midst  

May the Father judge him justly. 

  Who do you think you are  

  Justice. 

Your brother was murdered  

while you sit here  doing nothing. 

The Sand Snakes are with me. 

Without Doran we have no army 

to march against the Lannisters. 

Queen Cersei loves her children. 

And we have one of them. 

We rescue my niece  

bring her back to the family. 

You ever been to Dorne  

The Dornish are crazy. 

If he gets to her before we do  we 

lose our only chance for revenge. 

Here we serve the Many Faced God. 

To serve well  a girl must become no one. 

What do we with them after you wash them  

What are they doing 

with the bodies  

Get back to work. 

No. I ve been here 

for weeks. 

I m not scrubbing 

one more corpse 

until you tell me 

why I m doing it. 

You will know why. 

  When  

  When it s time  not before. 

Get back to work. 

When do I get to play the game  

Game  

The game. 

The Game of Faces. 

You tried already. 

You failed. 

I didn t even know 

I was playing. 

Who are you  

No one. 

Get back to work. 

Who are you  

What are you doing here  

How did you get here  

I m from Westeros just like you. 

Daughter of a lord 

just like you. 

Except I was an only child. 

Heir to his fortune. 

My mother died. 

My father remarried 

and his new wife 

gave birth to a girl. 

My stepmother didn t want any 

rivals for her precious daughter  

so she tried 

to kill me with poison. 

I found out. 

Sought help from 

the Faceless Men. 

And my father was widowed again. 

I ve been serving them 

ever since. 

Was that true or a lie  

What  

Did you believe 

every word I said  

Get back to work. 

 i Who are you  

Who are you  

Arya. 

And where did you come from  

 i Westeros. 

My family home is Winterfell. 

I m the youngest daughter 

of a great lord  

Eddard Stark. 

He died in battle. 

A lie. 

After he was executed  

I fled the capital. 

Had to kill a stable boy. 

Drove my sword through his back. 

A lie. 

I stabbed him in the gut. 

 i I tried to find  i  

 i my mother and brother  

 i but I never did. 

 i They were murdered  i  

 i by Walder Frey. 

An outlaw kidnapped me  

a man called Polliver. 

A man called the Hound. 

Sandor Clegane. 

He tried to sell me  

but was wounded in a fight. 

He begged me to kill him  

but I wouldn t. 

I left him 

in the mountains to die. 

I wanted him to suffer. 

I hated him. 

I hated him. 

That s not a lie  

A girl lies to me  

to the Many Faced God  

to herself. 

Does she truly 

want to be no one  

Yes. 

I m not playing 

this stupid game anymore  

We never stop playing. 

So  those villages 

we were supposed to find  

We can t live on 

berries and roots. 

I can. 

You re not hungry  

Of course I m hungry. 

You re an awful travelling 

companion  do you know that  

Possibly the least 

charming man I ve ever met. 

I m not your travelling 

companion. 

We are travelling together in 

each other s company  therefore   

Do you ever shut up  

I sailed from King s Landing 

to Pentos in a crate 

 i without ever saying a word. 

Why  

It never occurred to you 

to ask why until now  

You never wondered 

why Tyrion Lannister 

decided to visit 

a brothel in Volantis  

I m sure you visited many 

brothels in many cities. 

I killed my father. 

He wanted to execute me 

for a crime I didn t commit. 

And he was fucking 

the woman I loved. 

As miserable 

as you are  Mormont  

at least your father 

was a good man. 

What do you know 

about my father  

I met him. 

I visited the Wall. 

When I asked him about his men  

he knew all their stories  

every one of them. 

He actually cared about the 

people under his command. 

How do they put it in the Watch  

 We shall never see 

his like again.  

Oh  you didn t know. 

I m sorry. 

I am. 

How  

I only know what I heard. 

How  

 i He was leading an 

expedition beyond the Wall. 

There was a mutiny. 

He was murdered by his own men. 

We better keep moving. 

Valar morghulis. 

Valar dohaeris. 

I have nowhere else to go. 

I ve taken her to every 

healer in Braavos. 

I ve spent every penny I had. 

She suffers every day 

of her life. 

I just want it to end. 

It hurts. 

I know. 

Don t be afraid. 

I used to be like you. 

I was sick. 

I was dying. 

But my father 

never gave up on me. 

He loved me 

more than anything in the world  

just like your father loves you. 

So he brought me here. 

My father prayed 

to the Many Faced God. 

And I drank the water 

from his fountain. 

It healed me. 

I ve devoted my life to him now. 

You don t want to hurt anymore  

Drink. 

 i Is a girl ready  

To give up her ears  

her nose  her tongue  

 i Her hopes and dreams   i  

 i her loves and hates  

All that makes a girl 

who she is  

Forever  

No. 

A girl is not ready 

to become no one. 

But she is ready 

to become someone else. 

Why Daenerys  Why is 

she worth all this  

As I recall  the Mormonts 

fought against the Targaryens 

during Robert s Rebellion. 

Do you believe in anything  

I believe in lots of things. 

In something greater 

than ourselves  I mean. 

The gods  destiny. 

Do you believe there s 

a plan for this world  

No. 

Neither did I. 

I was a cynic just like you. 

Then I saw a girl 

step into a great fire 

with three stone eggs. 

When the fire burned out  I thought 

I d find her blackened bones. 

Instead  I saw her  Daenerys  

alive and unhurt  

holding her baby dragons. 

Have you ever heard 

baby dragons singing  

No. 

It s hard to be 

a cynic after that. 

Doesn t mean she s going 

to be a great queen. 

 i No  it doesn t. 

The Targaryens 

are famously insane. 

What if she conquers the world  

Then what  

  years of peace 

and prosperity  

First we have 

to conquer the world. 

We  

All right  let s assume 

your dreams come true. 

 i She s ecstatic when you  i  

 i bring her this enemy dwarf. 

 i She hacks off my head  i  

 i and restores your position. 

You command her army  

sail to Westeros  

defeat all your enemies and 

watch her climb those steps 

and sit on the Iron Throne. 

Hurrah. Long live the queen. 

Then what  

Then she rules. 

So a woman who has not spent a 

single day of her adult life 

in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros  

That s justice  

  She s the rightful heir. 

  Why  

Because her father  who burned living 

men for amusement  was the king  

  That s a slave ship. 

  Why are they anchored  

They probably 

came ashore for   

 i Water. 

Got a lot of fight in you  huh  

Salt mines  

Yeah  that or a galley slave. 

 i He looks strong enough. 

What about the dwarf  

Worthless. 

Cut his throat. 

Wait. Wait. Wait  wait  wait  

Let s discuss this. 

And then chop off his cock. 

We ll sell it for a fortune. 

A dwarf s cock has magic powers. 

Wait  Wait  

Wait  wait  wait  

You can t just hand 

a dry cock to a merchant 

and expect him to pay for it. 

He has to know 

it came from a dwarf. 

And how could he know 

unless he sees the dwarf  

It will be 

a dwarf sized cock. 

Guess again. 

The dwarf lives until we 

find a cock merchant. 

Queen Daenerys 

has outlawed slavery. 

We re bound for Volantis  

not Slaver s Bay. 

Besides  she reopened 

the fighting pits. 

I ve never heard of free men 

fighting in the pits. 

 i The fighting pits in Meereen  

You re in luck  then. 

You re about to be rich. 

You are looking at one of the great 

warriors in the Seven Kingdoms. 

Him. 

Him  He s got to 

be  years old. 

Sure  he s a bit 

long in the tooth  

a bit withered  

been in the sun too long. 

We can all see that. But he 

is a veteran of  battles. 

They wrote songs about him. 

That true  

He won the tournament 

at Lannisport. 

Unseating Ser Jaime 

Lannister himself. 

The Kingslayer. 

Jousting. You re talking 

about jousting. 

A fancy game for fancy lads. 

The men who fight in the pits of 

Meereen will swallow him whole. 

I killed a Dothraki 

bloodrider in single combat. 

Liar. 

It s no lie. 

His name was Qotho. 

He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. 

Take me to Slaver s Bay  

put a sword in my hand  

I ll prove my worth. 

For my children. 

Money. 

Lord Baelish. 

Yes  

Lancel Lannister. 

Brother Lancel. 

We abandon our family names. 

Quite a family to abandon. 

The city has changed 

since you were here last. 

We flooded the gutters 

with wine  

smashed the false idols  

and set the godless on the run. 

Well done. 

I m here on urgent business 

for the Queen Mother. 

Should I send word 

that I ll be delayed  

Step carefully  Lord Baelish. 

You ll find there s little 

tolerance for flesh peddlers 

in the new King s Landing. 

We both peddle fantasies  

Brother Lancel. 

Mine just happen 

to be entertaining. 

Do you think it s wise  

Your Grace  

arresting the heir 

to Highgarden  

The Faith arrested 

the heir to Highgarden. 

Of course  and the Faith 

were armed on your orders. 

The king s orders. 

Is the king to blame 

for Ser Loras s perversion  

House Tyrell won t 

tolerate this insult. 

House Tyrell won t tolerate it  

I m the insulted party  

Lord Baelish. 

Ser Loras was promised to me. 

Instead he chose 

the company of boys. 

One s choice of companion 

is a curious thing. 

Most curious. 

Lysa Arryn  for instance. 

Thoroughly repellant woman. 

Forgive me. 

I know you re still in mourning. 

Lysa was a good woman. 

A kind woman. 

 i She was neither of those things. 

We both know it. 

Still  I pity her son. 

How fortunate the young 

Lord of the Vale 

 i has a new father to counsel him. 

I know how hard it can be 

to lose both your parents 

at such a young age. 

If war comes to Westeros  will the Knights 

of the Vale fight for their king  

Young Lord Robin 

heeds my advice. 

And I have always counseled 

loyalty to the throne. 

Good. 

If there s nothing else. 

There is another matter  

Your Grace. 

Something so urgent I couldn t 

trust the words to a raven. 

You once charged me 

with finding Arya Stark. 

To my shame  I failed you. 

But I have found Sansa Stark. 

Alive and well and home again 

living at Winterfell. 

That s not possible. 

My sources are well placed. 

They tell me Roose Bolton 

plans to marry her 

to his son Ramsay  

a bastard recently 

legitimized by King Tommen. 

Roose Bolton is Warden of the 

North by the grace of my father. 

Indeed  his reward for stabbing 

his own king in the heart. 

We were fools 

to trust a turncloak. 

Marrying his son 

to the last of the Starks 

gives him more legitimacy 

in the North 

than an alliance with 

a hated southern house. 

I will skin him and his bastard 

like that wretch 

on their bloody sigil. 

I would counsel 

patience  Your Grace. 

Patience  

Sansa helped murder my son. 

Roose Bolton is a traitor. 

Stannis Baratheon 

is also a traitor  

marching with his army 

on Winterfell. 

Let Stannis and Roose battle. 

Let the enemies of the 

throne slaughter each other. 

And when they re done  seize Winterfell 

from whichever thief survives. 

Winterfell is   miles 

away from here. 

The weather has already 

begun to turn. 

That is why it is critical 

to strike soon 

while the victor 

still licks his wounds. 

Surely your Uncle Kevan 

could muster a force. 

My Uncle Kevan has all the 

courage of a kitchen mouse. 

Ser Jaime  then. 

 i Jaime s away on a sensitive 

diplomatic mission. 

I have no idea 

when he ll be back. 

 i Perhaps I can help. 

The Knights of the Vale are some 

of the best fighters in Westeros  

trained to battle 

in the ice and the snow. 

Forgive me  Lord Baelish  

you have a reputation 

as a moneylender 

and a brothel keeper  

not a military man. 

You wouldn t risk 

a single Lannister soldier 

or a single coin 

from the royal treasury. 

What do you have to lose  

A brothel keeper  

And if you succeed  

Name me Warden of the North. 

I ll speak to the king 

this evening  

have him issue a royal decree. 

I ll not rest until the 

lion flies over Winterfell. 

And I ll know 

you re a man of your word 

when I see Sansa Stark s 

head on a spike. 

As I said... 

I live to serve. 

I m going to ask him tomorrow. 

  What if he says no  

  He won t. 

We ve waited long enough. 

I want you to be my wife. 

Now. 

What is it  

Do you want to marry me because 

our families arranged it  

Or do you   

We can t. 

Not yet. 

Why not  

You know why not. 

Someone will see. 

You are going to be my wife. 

I am going to be your husband. 

We re allowed to walk through 

the gardens together. 

How many other girls have you 

walked through these gardens  

I like the way your eyes go 

squinty when you re jealous. 

They do not go squinty and you 

didn t answer the question. 

They make a lovely couple. 

A Lannister and a Martell. 

 i They have no idea  i  

 i how dangerous that is. 

We must protect them. 

Yes  my prince. 

You haven t had to use that 

axe of yours in a long time. 

I hope you remember how. 

I remember how. 

 i  The Dornishman s 

wife was as fair as the sun  

 And her kisses 

were warmer than spring  

 The Dornishman s blade  

 It was made of black steel  

 And its kiss 

was a terrible thing  

 The Dornishman s wife 

would sing as she bathed  

   In a voice that was sweet as a peach    

  All right  that s enough. 

I m coming to the best part. 

We re trying to blend in. 

Don t want everyone in 

Dorne to hear your accent. 

This song really is 

all about the ending. 

It can wait. 

There. 

That s the Water Gardens. 

 i And once we ve got 

the princess  then what  

I like to improvise. 

That explains the golden hand. 

Unbowed. Unbent. 

Unbroken. 

For Oberyn. 

For Oberyn. 

Well  she s made 

herself at home. 

Myrcella. 

Uncle Jaime  

I   

I don t understand. 

What are you doing here  

Let s speak in private. 

  I am Trystane Martell. 

  Trystane is my intended. 

Excellent. 

Good to meet you. 

We weren t expecting you  

Lord Jaime. 

Why don t you let them 

have some time alone  son  

Let s not do something stupid. 

That was something stupid. 

We have to go  Myrcella  now. 

  You hurt him  

  He ll be fine  I promise. 

But we have to   

Oh  for fuck s sake. 

Take her  

  You re coming with me. 

  I don t want to. 

I wasn t asking  princess. 

  Ah  

  Drop your weapons  

 i I am Obara Sand. 

Daughter of Oberyn Martell. 

I fight for Dorne. 

Who do you fight for  

Drop your weapons. 

When you were whole  it would 

have been a good fight. 

You fight pretty good 

for a little girl. 

Halt  

Oh  you can smell the shit 

from five miles away. 

Well  why have we stopped  

Go on. 

Rumors and gossip  

that s all they ve got. 

It s theater  nothing more. 

If they arrested all the pillow 

biters in King s Landing  

there d be no room left in the 

dungeons for anyone else. 

Everyone knew 

about him and Renly. 

Renly Baratheon shagged half the 

stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. 

Everyone knew  no one cared. 

But he was the king s brother. 

And Loras 

is the queen s brother. 

No  no  no  no. 

This is unacceptable. 

  Cersei s behind it. 

  Yeah  of course she is. 

She wants to drag our 

name through the dirt  

put us in our place. 

Get some rest  dear. 

You look appalling. 

Let me deal 

with Cersei Lannister. 

Your Grace  I have 

travelled a long way. 

You must be exhausted. 

Put the pen down  dear. We both 

know you re not writing anything. 

Ah  yes. The famously 

tart tongued Queen of Thorns. 

And the famous tart 

Queen Cersei. 

I beg your pardon  

I know you re behind this absurd 

incarceration of my grandson. 

If you apologize for that 

comment  perhaps I ll   

You ll get your apology 

when I get Loras. 

I was as shocked as anyone 

when the Faith 

arrested Ser Loras. 

I have no love 

for these fanatics  

but what can a Queen Mother do  

Has the crown 

suddenly stopped needing 

the troops  gold  and 

wheat my house supplies  

I can assure you  

our alliance with 

House Tyrell remains   

Do you expect 

the alliance to continue 

after you ve thrown 

our future into prison  

As I said  

I didn t imprison anyone. 

As for your 

veiled threats   

What veil  

The Lannister Tyrell alliance brought 

peace to a war torn country. 

Do you really want to see the Seven 

Kingdoms slide back into warfare  

I didn t trust your father. 

 i I didn t particularly like him. 

 i But I respected him.  i  

 i He was no fool. 

He understood that sometimes 

we must work with our rivals 

rather than destroy them. 

House Lannister has no rival. 

The High Septon has called 

for an inquest  not a trial. 

Just a small hearing 

to determine 

whether the charges 

against Loras have merit  

which I m sure they don t. 

Loras will be freed  our happy 

alliance will continue... 

and we ll forget this unfortunate 

conversation ever happened. 

Good day  Lady Olenna. 

You are aware of the rumors 

concerning you and Renly  

I don t pay attention to rumors. 

 i You were said to be 

despondent when he died. 

Witnesses state that you 

refused to leave his bedside 

even as Stannis s army 

closed in. 

He was my friend. 

He was my king. 

Wasn t Joffrey your king  

 i He was anointed  i  

 i by the Seven  not Renly. 

I was wrong to support 

Renly s claim  I know that. 

But I was forgiven by Joffrey. 

I fought for him at the 

Battle of Blackwater. 

Yes  wearing Renly s armor. 

Why does it matter what I wore  

Do you deny all 

the charges against you  

Fornication. 

 i Buggery.  i  

 i Blasphemy. 

Of course I deny them. 

You never lay 

with Renly Baratheon  

Never. 

 i Nor any other man  

Never. 

That will be all  Ser Loras. 

Well  I think that s 

quite enough of that. 

The Faith calls 

Queen Margaery forward. 

You call me forward  

Yes  we have some 

questions for you. 

  I am the queen. 

  You are. 

And according 

to the law of the Seven  

neither kings 

nor queens are exempt 

from testimony 

at a holy inquest. 

How do you respond to these 

charges against your brother  

They are lies. 

  All of them  

  All of them. 

 i Queen Margaery  

 i in the presence of the gods  

do you swear that your 

brother is innocent 

of these charges against him 

to the best of your knowledge  

Yes  I swear it. 

Thank you  Your Grace. 

Do you know this man  

Yes  very well. 

 i He is Ser Loras Tyrell   i  

 i heir to Highgarden. 

How did you come to meet  

 i I squired for him. 

He took a liking to me. 

He summoned me to his chamber 

the first day we met. 

And what occurred 

in his chamber  

We engaged 

in intimate relations. 

You lay with him  

That night and many others. 

Liar. 

He s a liar. 

Is there anyone else 

who can support your claim  

Yes. 

Yes  Queen Margaery. 

 i She walked in on us once  i  

 i not long ago. 

She didn t seem surprised. 

This testimony is an insult 

to a great house. 

Why should the Faith or anyone 

else take the word of a squire 

over the heir to Highgarden  

 i He has a birthmark  Your Grace. 

 i Quite high on his thigh. 

Wine colored and roughly 

the shape of Dorne. 

No  Liar  

What are you doing  

Let us pass. 

The Faith is satisfied 

there is enough evidence 

to bring a formal trial 

 i for Ser Loras 

and Queen Margaery. 

What  

Bearing false witness 

before the gods 

 i is as grave a sin  i  

 i as any  my lady. 

Take her. 

 i No. Tommen. 

Tommen  

You can t do this. 

I am the queen. 

Tommen  

Tommen  

 i I am your queen.  i  

 i How dare you  

 i Take your hands off me  

 i Tommen  

What do you want  

Lord Ramsay sent me to 

draw you a bath  my lady. 

You want to be clean and fresh 

for your new husband  don t you  

You re so beautiful  

but you need to keep him happy. 

Ramsay gets bored easily. 

You don t want 

to end up like   

well  like the others. 

What others  

I shouldn t gossip. 

Oh  it s good to see 

the red again. 

No point hiding anymore. 

What others  

Let s see  there was Kyra 

the blacksmith s daughter. 

She was tall like you  

lovely figure. 

But she talked 

and talked and talked 

and Ramsay grew tired of that. 

Then there was Violet. 

She had gorgeous blonde hair. 

But she got pregnant. 

And  well  that was boring. 

Then Tansy. 

Such a sweet girl. 

Of course  sweet girls 

get a bit dull 

after a while  don t they  

Ramsay let me come 

with him on that hunt. 

Hunt  

Mmm. 

Have you ever seen a body after 

the dogs have been at it  

Not so pretty. 

But  well  it s your 

wedding day. 

Why am I talking 

about such things  

What was your name again  

Myranda. 

And how long have yo 

loved him  Myranda  

Did you imagine that he would be 

with you forever  is that it  

And I came along and ruined it. 

I m Sansa Stark of Winterfell. 

This is my home 

and you can t frighten me. 

Are you done with 

your bath  my lady  

Go. I can finish 

on my own. 

Yes  

I ve come to escort you 

to the godswood  my lady. 

If you please  my lady  

will you take my arm  

No. 

Lord Ramsay  he said 

I m to take your arm. 

I m not touching you. 

Please. 

He ll punish me. 

You think I care 

what he does to you  

Who comes before 

the old gods this night  

Sansa of the House Stark 

comes here to be wed. 

A woman grown  

trueborn and noble. 

She comes to beg the 

blessings of the gods. 

Who comes to claim her  

Ramsay of House Bolton. 

 i Heir to the Dreadfort  i  

 i and Winterfell. 

Who gives her  

Theon of House Greyjoy  

who was   

who was her father s ward. 

Lady Sansa  

will you take this man  

I take this man. 

Are you pleased  my lady  

Good. I want you 

to be happy. 

My father said 

you re still a virgin. 

  Uh  yes. 

  Why  

Why are you still a virgin  

Afraid of dwarves  

Lord   Lord Tyrion was kind. 

He was gentle. 

He never touched me. 

You re not lying to me  

No  my lord. 

Lying to your husband 

on his wedding night  

that would be a bad way 

to start a marriage. 

We re man and wife now. 

We should be honest 

with each other. 

Don t you think  

Yes. 

Good. 

Take off your clothes. 

Oh  no  no  no. 

You stay here  Reek. 

You watch. 

Do I need to ask a second time  

I hate asking a second time. 

Reek... 

I told you to watch. 

You ve known Sansa 

since she was a girl. 

Now watch her become a woman. 

 i The Tyrells are a problem.  i  

The Tyrells helped us 

defeat Stannis Baratheon. 

You must see Highgarden. 

I don t think the queen 

would let me leave King s Landing. 

Once I marry Joffrey  

I ll be queen. 

And if you were 

to marry Loras... 

You must give yourself 

to the Lord of Light. 

  I have a wife. 

  She s shut away in a tower. 

And she s given you no sons  

only stillborns. 

I lost one son to the Kingslayer  

strangled with a chain. 

I grieve for 

your sons  my lord. 

I don t want your grief. 

I want my vengeance. 

Do that again 

and I ll take your other hand. 

  What value was the mill  

  I seized an opportunity. 

 i We took hostages    i

Willem and Martyn Lannister 

are  years old. 

I m not your enemy.

You want to 

assassinate a girl  

  Based on whose information  

 i   Ser Jorah Mormont.  i  

He is serving as advisor 

to the Targaryens. 

You bring us the whispers 

of a traitor. 

Beric Dondarrion  

If you mean to murder me  

then bloody well 

get on with it. 

You ll die soon enough  

but it won t be murder. 

I sentence you

Is it done  then

How often do these 

patrols go out  

It varies. 

If I knew where on the Wall we 

were heading  I could tell you. 

You d like to know that. 

There are  castles 

guarding the Wall. 

How many are manned  

Three. 

You sure of that

Castle Black. 

Aye  Castle Black.

Hmm. 

You seemed to like it. 

Aye  I liked it some. 

Who taught you that  

There s been no one else. 

Only you.

He came trading

That was the first one. 

Then there was

Yeah  thanks.

Outlaws steal. 

You re lucky 

we didn t kill you. 

Come try it  archer. 

I ll shove those arrows 

up your ass.

He s a murderer. He s guilty. 

  Not in the eyes of god.

the Kingslayer. 

Pick him up  Locke. 

You ve lost a hand. 

No  my lord  

he has it here. 

  Take this away. 

  Send it to his father  

You ll hold your tongue 

unless you want to lose it. 

Cut her free. 

Apologies  my lady. 

You re under 

my protection now. 

Thank you  my lord. 

Find suitable rooms 

for our guests. 

We ll speak later. 

Lord Bolton. 

Is there word 

from the capital  

You haven t heard  

Stannis Baratheon laid siege 

to King s Landing. 

 i Sailed into Blackwater Bay.  i  

 i Stormed the gates  i  

 i with thousands of men.  i  

And your sister... 

How can I put this  

Your sister... 

is alive and well. 

Your father s forces 

prevailed. 

Ser Jaime isn t well. 

Take him to Qyburn. 

  Will I die  

  No. 

The corruption 

has spread. 

I fear it must 

be cut away. 

The safest course would be 

to take the whole arm off. 

Then you ll die. 

You re no maester. 

Where s your chain  

The Citadel 

stripped me of it. 

They found some 

of my experiments 

too bold. 

I can leave your upper arm  

make the cut at your elbow. 

I don t need my right hand 

to kill you. 

I can take away 

the rotting flesh 

and try and burn out 

the corruption 

  with boiling wine. 

  Mmm. 

With any luck  

that will suffice. 

You ll need 

milk of the poppy. 

  No milk of the poppy. 

  There will be pain. 

  I ll scream. 

  Quite a bit of pain. 

I ll scream loudly. 

Lord Baelish. 

Your Grace. 

I wonder if I might 

ask you for a favor. 

Of course  Your Grace. 

I have reason to believe 

that House Tyrell 

do not hold the crown s 

best interests at heart. 

I see. And have you shared these 

suspicions with Lord Tywin  

My father s a practical man. 

He appreciates facts. 

Myself  I often 

find them a hindrance. 

And he appreciates those 

who aid his family  as you well know. 

He s almost as generous 

to those who help us 

as he is unpleasant 

towards those who don t. 

You have a good working 

relationship with the Tyrells. 

I thought you might look into it 

before you leave the capital. 

  I shall do my best. 

  Thank you. 

And your best will prove better than 

when I asked you to locate Arya Stark  

I assure you 

that it will. 

Gods  boy  that s enough. 

We re not in a tavern. 

  Pardon  my lady. 

  No need to speak. 

Are there any figs  

Fetch some. 

I always take figs 

midafternoon. 

They help move the bowels. 

To what do I owe 

this summons  

Thank you for seeing me  

my lady. 

I had hoped we might discuss 

a few financial matters. 

I climbed all those steps to discuss 

financial matters  

It s the royal wedding. 

I m told you had a hand 

in planning it. 

Naturally. 

It s shaping up to be 

a very involved affair. 

The word extravagant 

has been used. 

What good 

is the word extravagant 

if it can t be used 

to describe a royal wedding  

  I understand that. 

  Good. 

But  as Master of Coin  

it falls upon me 

to calculate the cost 

for the crown. 

As of now  

it s a huge expense. 

And  

And we re at war  

Lady Olenna. 

Oh  I d nearly 

forgotten. 

Yes  and maintaining 

supply lines   

 i I can t think  i  

 i how it slipped my mind.  i  

What is it  

  infantrymen 

 i the Tyrell family  i  

 i has supplied   i  

  mounted lances. 

 i   in support.  i  

Provisions so this city 

might survive the winter. 

 i A million bushels  i  

 i of wheat.  i  

Half a million bushels each 

of barley  oats  and rye. 

 i   head of cattle.  i  

 i   sheep.  i  

You don t have to lecture me 

about wartime expenses. 

I m quite familiar 

with them. 

And we are so grateful 

for your contributions 

which are necessary 

for the preservation of the realm. 

As is a royal wedding. 

The people are hungry 

for more than just food. 

They crave distractions. 

And if we don t provide them  

they ll create their own. 

And their distractions 

are likely to end 

with us being torn 

to pieces. 

 i A royal wedding  i  

 i is much safer.  i  

  Wouldn t you say  

  I would. 

 i And traditionally  i  

 i paid for  i  

by the royal family. 

I was told you were 

drunk  impertinent  

and thoroughly debauched. 

You can imagine 

my disappointment 

at finding nothing 

but a browbeaten bookkeeper. 

Where did you go 

for them  Volantis  

  My lady   

  Oh  very well. 

I won t have it said 

that House Tyrell 

refuses to play 

its part. 

We ll pay for half 

the expenses 

and the celebrations 

will go on as planned. 

  Is that sufficient  

  Quite sufficient. Thank you. 

Very good  then. 

That s settled. Good day. 

Give me that. 

 i What are you doing   i  

Just mending 

Lord Beric s armor. 

Why  

I m going to stay on 

and smith for the Brotherhood. 

Have you lost your mind  

When the Lannisters find this place  

you think they ll spare the smiths  

They ll cave your head in 

with your own helmet. 

The Lannisters wanted to kill me long 

before I joined the Brotherhood. 

You don t have to do this. 

I want to. 

They need good men. 

Robb needs good men  too. 

We re leaving tomorrow. 

  And then you   

  What  Serve him  

I ve served men 

my entire life. 

I served Master Mott 

at King s Landing 

and he sold me 

to the Watch. 

I served Lord Tywin 

at Harrenhal  

wondering every day 

if I d get tortured or killed. 

I m done serving. 

You just said you were 

serving Lord Beric. 

He may be their leader  

but they chose him. 

These men are brothers. 

They re a family. 

I ve never had a family. 

I can be your family. 

You wouldn t be 

my family. 

You d be  my lady.  

Willem. 

Willem  

  Is this a rescue  

  Lannister filth  Take him  

Please  I didn t do anything. 

I m just a squire. 

Please   

Bring them in. 

Is that all of them  

It took five of you to murder 

two unarmed squires  

Not murder  

Your Grace. 

Vengeance. 

Vengeance  

Those boys didn t 

kill your sons. 

I saw Harrion die 

on the battlefield and Torrhen   

Was strangled 

by the Kingslayer. 

  They were his kin. 

  They were boys  

Look at them. 

Tell your mother 

to look at them. 

 i She killed them  i  

 i as much as I.  i  

My mother had nothing 

to do with this. 

This was your treason. 

It s treason 

to free your enemies. 

In war  you kill 

your enemies. 

Did your father 

not teach you that  boy  

Leave him. 

Aye. 

Leave me to the king. 

He wants to give me 

a scolding before he sets me free. 

That s how he deals 

with treason. 

Our King in the North. 

Or should I call him 

the King Who Lost 

the North  

Escort Lord Karstark 

to the dungeon. 

Hang the rest. 

Mercy  sire  

I didn t kill anyone. 

I only watched 

for the guards. 

This one was only 

the watcher. 

Hang him last so he can watch 

the others die. 

 i Please  Please  no.  i  

 i They made me do it   i  

They made me  

They made me  

Word of this 

can t leave Riverrun. 

They were Tywin 

Lannister s nephews. 

The Lannisters 

pay their debts. 

 i They never stop  i  

 i talking about it.  i  

Would you make me a liar 

as well as a murderer  

It wouldn t be lying. 

We will bury them 

and remain silent 

 i until the war is done.  i  

I m not fighting 

for justice 

if I don t serve justice 

to murderers in my ranks  

 i no matter how highborn.  i  

He has to die. 

The Karstarks 

are Northmen. 

They won t forgive 

the killing of their lord. 

Your mother s right. 

If you do this  the Karstarks will 

abandon you. 

You tended to their wounds. 

You brought them supper. 

Now they re dead. 

And more boys will keep dying 

until this war is over. 

 i You need Karstark men  i  

 i to end it.  i  

Spare his life. 

Keep him as a hostage. 

A hostage. 

 i Tell the Karstarks  i  

 i that as long as they remain loyal   i  

he will not be harmed. 

The blood of the First Men 

flows through my veins 

as much as yours  boy. 

I fought the Mad King 

for your father. 

I fought Joffrey 

for you. 

We are kin   

Stark and Karstark. 

That didn t stop you 

from betraying me. 

And it won t save you now. 

I don t want it 

to save me. 

I want it to haunt you 

to the end of your days. 

Kneel  my lord. 

Rickard Karstark  

 i Lord of Karhold   i  

here in sight of gods and men  

I sentence you to die. 

Would you speak 

a final word  

Kill me 

and be cursed. 

You are no king of mine. 

 i Joffrey.  i  

Cersei. 

Ilyn Payne. 

Ser Meryn. 

The Hound. 

What are you 

going to do with me  

At first light 

we ll ride for Riverrun. 

Your brother s there now. 

He ll make a contribution 

to our cause 

and you can go home. 

I m a hostage 

and you re selling me. 

Don t think of it 

that way. 

  But it is that way. 

   i It is.  i  

  And it isn t. 

  More is than isn t. 

Beric admired your father 

a great deal  you know. 

He wanted to refuse 

your ransom altogether. 

  So why don t you  

  We need the gold. 

Do I frighten you  child  

No. 

You re angry with me. 

And I don t blame you. 

But letting him go 

was the right thing. 

I have more reason than most 

to want him hanged. 

  I thought he killed you. 

  He did. 

But how...  

Thoros... 

how many times 

have you brought me back  

It s the Lord of Light 

brings you back. 

I m just the lucky drunk 

who says the words. 

  How many times  

   i Five  I think.  i  

 i No  this makes six.  i  

Six. 

There was the first time   

the Mountain. 

 i Show her.  i  

Lance right through 

the chest. 

Then I was stabbed 

in the belly. 

Then it was an arrow 

in the back. 

 i And that axe in the side.  i  

Then the Lannisters caught me 

and executed me for treason. 

Was it a hanging 

or a dagger in the eye  

Both. 

Fuckers couldn t decide. 

 i And the Hound makes six.  i  

Second time I ve been 

killed by a Clegane. 

 i You d think you d learn.  i  

It s not getting 

any easier  you know. 

 i I know.  i  

 i Every time I come back   i  

I m a bit less. 

Pieces of you 

get chipped away. 

Could you bring back 

a man without a head  

Not six times. 

Just once. 

I don t think it works 

that way  child. 

He was a good man  

Ned Stark. 

 i He s at rest now   i  

 i somewhere.  i  

I would never wish 

my life upon him. 

I would. 

You re alive. 

Lord  cast your light 

upon me. 

Protect me 

in the darkness. 

Burn away my sins. 

Help me serve you. 

Use me as you will. 

For the night is dark 

and full of terrors. 

I have prayed day and night 

for you to come to me. 

My lady. 

I meant to come sooner. 

  The battle   

  I know of your troubles  my king. 

The Lady Melisandre 

has told me everything. 

Yes  of course. 

You mustn t despair. 

Your claim is true. 

  You will be victorious. 

  I believed that once. 

You are 

the one god s champion 

and the finest man 

I ve ever known. 

Selyse. 

I ve broken a sacred vow. 

I ve sinned. 

  No. 

  I ve wronged you. 

  I have shamed you. 

  You re doing god s work. 

You don t understand. 

The Red Woman   

the Lady Melisandre   

I know  Stannis. 

The Lady Melisandre 

has told me everything. 

No act done in service 

of the Lord of Light 

can ever be a sin. 

When she told me  

I wept with joy. 

Oh  my sweet boys. 

 i Petyr  Tommard   i  

 i Edric.  i  

I thank god 

every day 

 i for bringing  i  

 i Melisandre to us.  i  

She gave you a son. 

I gave you... 

   i nothing.  i  

  That s not true. 

So you ve come 

to see her as well  

There is no need. 

You must keep away 

from such distractions. 

She s my daughter. 

I want to see her. 

You are a king. 

You don t need 

my permission. 

 i     Under the sea      i  

 i     I know  I know      i  

 i     Oh  oh  oh      i  

    The birds have scales     

    And the fish take wing     

    I know  I know     

    Oh  oh  oh...     

 i Shireen.  i  

Father  

You ve grown 

since I last saw you. 

Mother said you fought 

in a battle. 

Did you win  

No. 

Did the Onion Knight 

come back with you  

He did. 

He fought bravely. 

He hasn t come 

to visit me. 

He said he d bring me back a 

present from the capital. 

He won t be visiting  child. 

Why not  

He s my friend. 

Look. 

He made this for me. 

But don t tell Mother 

I have it. 

It s a secret. 

Mother doesn t like 

the Onion Knight. 

Ser Davos 

is a traitor. 

He s rotting in a dungeon 

cell for his crime. 

Best forget him. 

Not so hard. 

You ll scrub the skin off. 

What are you 

doing here  

I need a bath. 

Help me out 

of these rags. 

Now get out. 

There s another tub. 

This one suits me fine. 

Don t worry. 

I m not interested. 

 i If I faint  pull me out.  i  

I don t intend to be the first Lannister 

to die in a bathtub. 

Why should I care 

how you die  

You swore a solemn vow  

remember  

You re supposed to get me to 

King s Landing in one piece. 

Not going so well  is it  

No wonder Renly died 

with you guarding him. 

That was unworthy. 

Forgive me. 

You protected me 

better than most   

  Don t you mock me. 

  I m apologizing. 

I m sick of fighting. 

 i Let s call a truce.  i  

You need trust 

to have a truce. 

I trust you. 

 i There it is.  i  

 i There s the look.  i  

I ve seen it for  years 

on face after face. 

 i You all despise me.  i  

Kingslayer. 

Oathbreaker. 

A man without honor. 

You ve heard of wildfire  

Of course. 

 i The Mad King  i  

 i was obsessed with it.  i  

He loved to watch 

people burn  

the way their skin 

blackened and blistered 

 i and melted  i  

 i off their bones.  i  

 i He burned lords  i  

 i he didn t like.  i  

 i He burned Hands  i  

 i who disobeyed him.  i  

He burned anyone 

who was against him. 

Before long  half the country 

was against him. 

Aerys saw traitors 

everywhere. 

So he had his pyromancer 

place caches of wildfire 

 i all over the city    i  

beneath the Sept 

of Baelor 

and the slums 

of Flea Bottom. 

Under houses  

stables  taverns. 

Even beneath 

the Red Keep itself. 

Finally  

the day 

of reckoning came. 

Robert Baratheon 

marched on the capital 

after his victory 

at the Trident. 

But my father 

arrived first 

with the whole Lannister 

army at his back  

promising to defend the city 

against the rebels. 

I knew my father 

better than that. 

 i He s never been one  i  

 i to pick the losing side.  i  

 i I told the Mad King  i  

 i as much.  i  

I urged him 

to surrender peacefully. 

 i But the king didn t  i  

 i listen to me.  i  

He didn t listen to Varys 

who tried to warn him. 

But he did listen 

to Grand Maester Pycelle  

that grey  sunken cunt. 

 You can trust 

the Lannisters   he said. 

 The Lannisters 

have always been 

true friends 

of the crown.  

So we opened the gates 

and my father 

sacked the city. 

 i Once again   i  

 i I came to the king   i  

begging him to surrender. 

He told me to... 

bring him 

my father s head. 

Then he... 

turned to his pyromancer. 

 Burn them all   

he said. 

 Burn them 

in their homes. 

Burn them 

in their beds.  

Tell me  

if your precious Renly 

commanded you to kill 

your own father 

and stand by while 

thousands of men  

women  and children 

burned alive  

would you have done it  

Would you have 

kept your oath then  

First  I killed 

the pyromancer. 

 i And then when the king  i  

 i turned to flee   i  

I drove my sword 

into his back. 

 i  Burn them all    i  

 i he kept saying.  i  

 Burn them all.  

I don t think 

he expected to die. 

He   he meant to... 

burn with the rest of us 

and rise again  

reborn as a dragon 

to turn his enemies 

to ash. 

I slit his throat to make sure 

that didn t happen. 

That s where Ned Stark 

found me. 

If this is true... 

why didn t you tell anyone  

Why didn t you tell 

Lord Stark  

Stark  

You think 

the honorable Ned Stark 

wanted to hear my side  

He judged me guilty 

the moment 

he set eyes on me. 

By what right 

does the wolf 

judge the lion  

  By what right  

  Help  Help  

The Kingslayer  

Jaime. 

My name is Jaime. 

 i Onion Knight.  i  

 i Ser Onion Knight.  i  

Princess  

Gods  what are you doing here  

  Shh  you ll wake Bert. 

  Bert  

He s the fat one. 

He s on guard duty tonight. 

He likes to drink wine 

and sleep a lot. 

Go back to your room. 

You re not supposed to be here. 

  If your father knew   

  He said you were a traitor. 

Are you  

I am  child. 

I disobeyed my king  

your father  

and now I m paying 

the price. 

I don t care. 

You re my friend. 

You must get bored 

down here. 

I brought you 

something to read. 

It s about Aegon 

and his dragons. 

Aegon used to live here. 

Did you know that  

  And the Targaryens built this castle. 

  Aye. 

  So they did. 

  You can hide the book under your cloak. 

It s a good one. 

I ll bring you more. 

Thank you  my lady. 

I m sure it s a fine book  

but it s wasted on me. 

Take it. 

I have more. 

My lady  I can t read 

the words. 

You can t  

I ll teach you. I ll come when 

Bert s on duty and teach you. 

  No. No. No. 

  It s easy. It ll be fun. 

  Go. We can t. 

  Why not  

What will they do  

lock us in cells  

I wouldn t know 

where to start. 

At the beginning. 

This word is Aegon. 

When you see A  E  and G 

together like that  

it sounds like egg. 

And the title 

of the whole book 

is  An History 

of Aegon the Conqueror 

 i and His Conquest  i  

 i of Westeros.   i  

It was a bitch 

of a siege. 

Mm  you were first 

through the breach at Pyke  

The second. 

Thoros of Myr went in alone  

waving that 

flaming sword of his. 

Thoros of Myr. 

Bloody madman. 

Robert knighted you 

after the battle  

Proudest moment 

of my life. 

One knee in the dust  

the king s sword on my shoulder  

listening to the words. 

 In the name of the Warrior  

I charge you to be brave.  

All I could think of 

was how badly I had to piss. 

In full plate metal 

for  hours. 

Never occurred to me 

till the fighting was over. 

I was very nearly the first man 

knighted to piss on the king s boots. 

Robert would have 

laughed. 

He was a good man  

a great warrior. 

And a terrible king. 

I burned away my years 

fighting for terrible kings. 

  You swore an oath. 

  Yes. 

And a man of honor 

keeps his vows  

even if he s serving 

a drunk or a lunatic. 

Just once in my life 

before it s over  

I want to know what it s like 

to serve with pride  

to fight for someone 

I believe in. 

Do you believe in her  

With all my heart. 

These are the ones  

Yes  khaleesi. 

The officers. 

All Unsullied boys 

are given new names 

when they are cut   

Grey Worm  Red Flea  

Black Rat. 

 i Names that remind them  i  

 i what they are    i  

vermin. 

 i King Robert  i  

 i wanted her dead.  i  

Of course 

he wanted her dead. 

She s a Targaryen. 

The last Targaryen. 

I suppose no one on the small 

council could speak sense to him. 

  I didn t sit on the small council. 

  No  

Doesn t the Lord Commander 

of the Kingsguard traditionally   

Traditionally  yes  

but I killed a dozen 

of Robert s friends 

during his rebellion. 

He didn t want advice 

on how to govern 

from a man who had fought 

for the Mad King. 

Can t say 

I minded much. 

I always hated 

the politics. 

Yeah  I imagine 

I would  too. 

Hours spent jabbering 

about backstabbings 

  and betrayals the world over. 

  Mm hmm. 

Still  she ll have 

to wade through that muck 

if she wants to rule 

the Seven Kingdoms. 

She ll have good men 

around her to advise her  

men with experience. 

Which men do you 

have in mind  

Forgive me  Ser Jorah  

for what I m about to say  

but your reputation in Westeros 

has suffered over the years. 

It suffered for a reason. 

I sold men into slavery. 

I don t know 

if your presence by her side 

will help our cause 

when we go home. 

Our cause  

Forgive me  Ser Barristan  

but I was busy 

defending the khaleesi against 

King Robert s assassins 

while you were still 

bowing to the man. 

We both want her to rule. 

Am I wrong  

You only joined us 

a few days ago. 

I can t speak 

to your intentions. 

If we re truly 

her loyal servants  

we will do whatever 

needs to be done  

no matter the cost  

no matter our pride. 

You re not 

Lord Commander here. 

You re just another exile. 

And I take my orders 

from the queen. 

 i   Come to bed.  i  

  You were right. 

The Karstarks are gone. 

Almost half our forces. 

Tywin Lannister knows what he 

needs to do to make us unravel. 

Nothing. 

Only wait. 

Don t let him. 

What can I do  

Attack King s Landing  

There s nothing 

he d like better. 

He d crush us 

in a day. 

We could ride north. 

 i Take your land back  i  

 i from the Greyjoys.  i  

  Wait out the winter. 

  Winter could last five years. 

Once my bannermen 

are home again  

sitting by the fire  

surrounded by their families  

warm and safe  

they ll never ride south again. 

When I gathered 

my lords together  

we had a purpose  

a mission. 

Now we re like a band 

of bickering children. 

Give them a new purpose. 

What  

Oh  I don t know. 

I don t even know 

where Winterfell is. 

Here. 

And we re here. 

King s Landing   

What is it  

I can t force them 

to meet us in the field 

and I can t attack them 

where they re strongest  

but I can attack them 

where they re not. 

And Casterly Rock 

can t run away. 

I m going to take 

their home away from them. 

Can you do it  

I need men to replace the Karstarks 

who marched home. 

There is only one person 

in this kingdom 

with that kind of army who hasn t 

already sided with the Lannisters. 

The man whose daughter 

I was supposed to marry   

Walder Frey. 

He s such 

a splendid fighter. 

Do you have any idea 

when we might... 

I ll plant the seed 

as soon as Joffrey and I are married. 

It should grow quickly. 

Joffrey won t let me leave. 

He s got too many reasons 

to keep me here. 

And only one 

to let you go. 

Because it will 

please me. 

 i Squire   i  

Well fought  ser. 

That was no fight. 

I don t know you. 

Olyver  

if it please you. 

I should like to see you spar with 

a proper partner  ser. 

How did you know  

Know what  

That I wanted to. 

My lord... 

I ll have you know 

I m to be married soon 

and even my intended 

hasn t the slightest notion. 

They rarely do  

in my experience. 

You have a good deal 

of experience  do you  

With the husbands. 

That didn t take long. 

Well  it took long enough. 

It seems our Knight of Flowers 

is engaged to be wed. 

Is he  

And... 

who s the lucky girl  

 i She may not be the grandest  i  

 i ship in the world  i  

or the fastest  

but she s mine. 

I ve always wanted a ship. 

Now I want a dozen. 

  Strange  isn t it  

  What is  

It doesn t matter 

what we want  

once we get it  

then we want 

something else. 

Your hair is different. 

Is it  

Lady Margaery 

wears it that way. 

Many ladies 

wear it this way. 

I have good news. 

I ll be leaving 

the city soon. 

You still want me 

to come with you  

It s not a question 

of what I want. 

It s what you want. 

You want to go home  

don t you  

Of course. 

More than anything. 

But maybe it would 

be better to wait. 

I ve been thinking 

how dangerous it would be. 

Not just for me  

but for you. 

You ve been so kind. 

I d feel terrible if anything 

happened to you. 

I can t tell you 

how touched I am 

by your concern 

for my welfare. 

I hope you know that 

I m your friend  Sansa. 

Your true friend. 

I do  Lord Baelish. 

  Petyr. 

  Petyr. 

If you wish to stay  

then of course 

you will stay. 

We ll speak again 

when I return. 

 i You re late.  i  

What s she doing here  

Our business 

concerns her  too. 

 i Sit.  i  

You ll be pleased to learn 

that after one conversation 

with Olenna Tyrell  

I ve saved the crown 

hundreds of thousands 

on this wedding. 

Never mind that now. 

We have something 

important to discuss. 

I m Master of Coin. 

Saving money is important. 

Stop that. 

You re making me 

uncomfortable. 

Your sister has learned that 

your new friends the Tyrells 

are plotting to marry 

Sansa Stark to Ser Loras. 

Very well. 

She s a lovely girl. 

Missing some of Loras  

favorite bits  

but I m sure 

they ll make do. 

  Your jokes are not appreciated. 

  It wasn t my best  but   

I bring them into the royal fold 

and this is how they repay me  

by trying to steal the key to 

the North out from under me. 

Sansa is the key 

to the North  

I seem to remember 

she has an older brother. 

The Karstarks 

have marched home. 

The young wolf has lost half his army. 

His days are numbered. 

 i Theon Greyjoy murdered  i  

 i both his brothers.  i  

That makes Sansa Stark 

the heir to Winterfell. 

And I am not about 

to hand her over to the Tyrells. 

 i The Tyrell army is helping  i  

 i us to win this war.  i  

Do you really think 

it s wise to refuse them  

There s nothing to refuse. 

This is a plot. 

 i Plots are not  i  

 i public knowledge.  i  

And the Tyrells 

won t carry this one out 

until after 

Joffrey s wedding. 

We need to act first 

and kill this union in its crib. 

And how do we do that  

We find Sansa Stark 

a different husband. 

  Wonderful. 

  Yes  it is. 

You can t mean it. 

I can and I do. 

Joffrey has made this 

poor girl s life miserable 

since the day he took 

her father s head. 

Now she s finally free of 

him and you give her to me  

That s cruel even for you. 

Do you intend 

on mistreating her  

The girl s happiness 

is not my concern  

  nor should it be yours. 

  She s a child  

She s flowered  I assure you. 

She and I have discussed it at length. 

There  you see  You will wed her  

bed her  and put a child in her. 

   i Surely you re capable of that.  i  

  And if I refuse  

You wanted to be rewarded 

for your valor in battle. 

Sansa Stark is a finer reward than 

you could ever dare hope for. 

And it is past time 

you were wed. 

I was wed. 

Or don t you remember  

Only too well. 

 i You should be thanking  i  

 i the gods for this.  i  

This is more 

than you deserve. 

 i Tyrion will do as he s bid.  i  

As will you. 

What do you mean  

You ll marry Ser Loras. 

  I will not. 

  The boy is heir to Highgarden. 

Tyrion will secure the North  

you will secure the Reach. 

  No  I won t do it. 

  Yes  you will. 

You re still fertile. 

You need to marry again and breed. 

I am Queen Regent  

not some broodmare. 

You re my daughter  

You will do as I command 

and you will marry 

Loras Tyrell 

and put an end 

to the disgusting rumors 

about you 

once and for all. 

Father  don t make me 

do it again  please. 

Not another word. 

My children. 

You ve disgraced the Lannister 

name for far too long. 

 i     It s always summer      i  

 i     Under the sea      i  

 i     I know  I know      i  

 i     Oh  oh  oh      i  

 i     The birds have scales      i  

 i     And the fish take wing      i  

 i     I know  I know      i  

 i     Oh  oh  oh      i  

 i     The rain is dry      i  

 i     And snow falls up      i  

 i     I know  I know      i  

 i     Oh  oh  oh      i  

 i     The stones crack open      i  

 i     The water burns      i  

 i     The shadows come  i  

 i to dance      i  

 i     My lord      i  

 i     The shadows come      i  

 i     To play      i  

 i     The shadows  i  

 i come to dance      i  

 i     My lord      i  

 i     The shadows come      i  

 i     To stay.      i  

Ser Hugh a t il de la famille 

dans la capitale  

Non. 

J ai mont  la veill e fun bre  hier. 

Il n avait personne. 

Il avait  trenn  une nouvelle armure. 

Il a eu la malchance 

de  devoir affronter la Montagne. 

Qui en a d cid  ainsi  

Tous les chevaliers tirent   

la courte paille  Lord Stark. 

Et qui tenait ces pailles  

Merci mes soeurs. 

La vie est bien  trange. 

Il n y a pas si longtemps  

nous  tions ennemis  

au Trident. 

Je me r jouis de n avoir jamais d  vous 

affronter sur le champ de bataille Ser Barristan. 

Ma femme vous en sait  galement gr   

Elle n aurait gu re appr ci   

d  tre veuve  

Vous  tes trop modeste. 

Je vous ai vu terrasser bien 

de vaillants chevaliers. 

Mon p re vous consid rait 

comme le meilleur. 

Et dans ce domaine  son  

jugement  tait infaillible. 

Votre p re  tait un homme bien. 

Ce que le Roi Fou lui a fait 

est une inf mie. 

Ce gar on... 

n  tait  il y a peu  

 qu un simple  cuyer 

Comment a t il pu acqu rir 

une nouvelle armure  

Lord Arryn lui aura  peut  tre 

laiss  quelque argent. 

J ai entendu dire que le Roi  

voulait combattre  aujourd hui. 

N y comptez point  

Robert n en fait qu   sa t te. 

Si tel  tait le cas  

il serait encore en train de 

combattre je ne sais quelle r bellion  

Elle est trop  troite  Sire  

 a n ira pas  

Ta m re  tait une catin  

avec un gros cul. 

Le savais tu  

Regardez moi cet idiot  

Une couille et pas de cervelle  

M me pas capable d armer proprement. 

Tu es trop gras pour 

ton armure. 

Gras  

Gras  dis tu  

C est ainsi que tu t adresses 

  ton Roi  

C  tait dr le  non  

Non  votre Majest . 

Non  

Tu n appr cies pas l humour de la Main  

Cesse de torturer ce pauvre gar on. 

Tu as entendu  

Le Roi est trop gras pour cette armure. 

Il me faut un pectoral 

de plates plus large  et tout de suite  

 Un pectoral de plates   

Je doute qu il comprenne  

Tu aurais d  le dessiner  

Tu as raison. 

Mais  tu m as vu  je sais encore 

utiliser une lance. 

Tu n as rien   faire dans la m l e. 

Laisse la place aux jeunes. 

Et pourquoi cel   parce que je suis le Roi  

J ai envie de cogner quelqu un  

 Et qui oserait vous frapper  

 Eh bien  tous  s ils peuvent. 

 Et le dernier demeur  en selle... 

  Sera toi. 

Il n est pas un homme dans 

les Sept Couronnes 

qui oserait te porter un coup. 

Ces pleutres me laisseraient gagner  

  Bois. 

  Je n ai pas soif. 

Bois. 

Ton Roi te l ordonne. 

Grands dieux  

trop gras pour mon armure. 

Ton  cuyer est un Lannister  

Un parfait imb cile 

mais Cersei a insist ... 

Je suis redevable  

  Jon Arryn. 

 Cersei Lannister serait un bon parti  

disait il. 

 Vous aurez besoin de l appui 

de son p re  

Je pensais qu  tre Roi signifait 

faire tout ce que je voulais. 

Assez parl . 

Allons assister   la joute. 

Allons humer le sang frais. 

  Robert  

  Quoi  

Oh. 

Une sacr e vision pour 

le peuple  

Inclinez vous devant votre Roi  

Allez  vermine  

 O  est Arya. 

 A sa le on de danse. 

Le Chevalier des Fleurs. 

Merci  Ser Loras. 

Emp chez Ser Gregor 

de lui faire du mal. 

 Je ne veux pas voir  a. 

Cent dragons d or 

sur la Montagne. 

Pari tenu. 

Comment vais je d penser cet argent  

J h site entre douze tonneaux 

de vin de Dorne 

Ou une fille d une maison de  

joie de Lys. 

Vous pourriez aussi vous 

acheter un ami  

Il va  tre tu . 

Ser Loras est un bon cavalier. 

Quel dommage  

Littlefinger. 

Vous n aurez donc pas d ami  

Dites moi Lord Renly  

Quand reverrez vous le v tre  

Loras savait que sa b te 

 tait en chaleur. 

Voil  qui  tait fort malin. 

Ser Loras n agirait pas ainsi. 

Il n y a gu re d honneur   tricher. 

Gu re d honneur mais des pi ces d or  

Mon  p e  

Arr tez le  

Arr tez ces folies. 

Au nom de votre Roi  

Laissez le aller. 

Je vous dois la vie  Ser. 

Je ne suis pas Ser. 

Otez son capuchon. 

Nous ne sommes pas sur 

la Route Royale. 

Vous aviez pr tendu que nous 

allions   Winterfell. 

Je l ai en effet dit   maintes 

reprises et le plus fort possible. 

Voil  qui est astucieux. 

Ils partiront 

  ma recherche mais 

ne seront pas dans la bonne direction. 

A l heure qu il est  mon  p re 

a d   tre inform . 

Il offrira une belle r compense. 

Nul n ignore qu un Lannister 

paye toujours ses dettes. 

Auriez vous la bont  

de me d tacher  

 pourquoi devrais je le faire  

 Que craignez vous  

Croyez vous que je vais m enfuir  

Les clans des collines me 

tueraient pour mes bottes  

A moins que je ne sois d vor  

par un Chat de l Ombre. 

Vous aurez d autres sources 

d inqui tude. 

Ah  la route de L est. 

Nous nous dirigeons vers le Val. 

Vous me menez chez votre soeur 

pour r pondre de crimes 

que je n ai pas commis. 

Dites moi  Lady Stark  depuis quand 

n avez vous pas vu votre soeur  

Cinq ans. 

Elle a bien chang . 

Elle  tait d j  un peu folle 

mais  maintenant... 

Autant me tuer tout de suite  ici. 

  Je ne suis pas un assassin  Lannister. 

 Moi  non plus  

je ne suis pour rien dans la 

tentative de meurtre contre votre fils. 

  Et le poignard  

 Il faudrait  tre le dernier des idiots 

pour armer de sa propre lame  

un tueur   gages. 

 Dois je le faire taire  

  Pourquoi  

Mes arguments seraient ils 

pertinents  

Rodrik  

Madame  suivez moi. 

D tachez moi. 

Que je meure maintenant 

ou plus tard... 

Rodrik  

Je vais bien  Madame. 

Inutile de vous inqui ter. 

C est ton premier  

Il te faut une femme.

Alors  comment peux tu me

Tes raisonnements brillants

Je ne tirerai plus

Et pourquoi donc  

 Il faut des jambes pour manier l arc.

Allez. 

Je ne te ferai aucun mal. 

Comment se porte votre fils   

messire  

Il ne remarchera plus jamais. 

Mais il est sain d esprit. 

C est ce qu on m a dit. 

C est une b n diction. 

Enfant  j ai  galement  t

Certaines portes se ferment 

  tout jamais... 

D autres s ouvrent 

sur des mondes bien surprenants. 

Puis je  

Si ce que je vais vous dire 

arrivait aux oreilles de certains  

Je ne donnerais pas cher de ma t te. 

Et qui pleurera le pauvre 

Varys  

Au Nord comme au Sud  on ne 

chante pas les louanges des Araign es. 

Mais  je me dois de vous dire 

certaines choses. 

Vous  tes la Main du Roi 

et le Roi est imb cile. 

Votre ami  certes  

mais un imb cile. 

Et perdu si vous ne le sauvez. 

Je suis dans la capitale depuis un mois. 

Pourquoi avoir tant attendu  

avant de m en parler  

Je n avais pas confiance en vous  

Pourquoi me faites vous confiance  

  pr sent  

La Reine n est pas la seule 

  vous surveiller de pr s. 

Les hommes d honneur ne sont pas 

l gion dans la Capitale. 

Vous  tes l un d entre eux. 

J aime croire 

que j en suis un  galement  

aussi  trange que cel  

puisse paraitre. 

Quelle menace plane sur le Roi  

Le m me destin que Lord Arryn. 

Les  larmes de Lys  

Tel est son nom. 

Une denr e rare et co teuse  

aussi limpide et insipide que l eau. 

Elle ne laisse aucune trace. 

Qui lui administra le poison  

Un bon ami  sans doute. 

Mais lequel  

Il y en avait tant. 

Lord Arryn  tait la bont  

et la confiance m mes. 

Il y avait un gar on. 

Tout ce qu il  tait  

il le devait   Jon Arryn. 

Son  cuyer  Ser Hugh  

Quel dommage qu il soit  

mort si jeune 

alors que la vie commen ait 

  lui sourire. 

Si Ser Hugh l a empoisonn ... 

Qui a pay  Ser Hugh  

Quelqu un qui en avait les moyens. 

Jon  tait un homme de paix. 

Il a  t  la Main du Roi 

pendant  ans. 

 bonnes ann es. 

Pourquoi l assassiner. 

Il commen ait   poser 

des questions. 

Il a d j  trouv  un b tard  

il a le livre. 

Le reste ne tardera pas. 

Et quand il saura la v rit   

que fera t il  

Les Dieux seuls le savent. 

Ces idiots ont  ssay  

de supprimer son fils. 

Et le pire est 

qu il l ont loup . 

Le loup et le lion ne vont 

tarder   s entre  gorger. 

 Nous serons bient t en guerre  mon ami. 

 A quoi bon la guerre  maintenant  

Nous ne sommes pas pr ts. 

Une Main est bien morte  

pourquoi pas deux  

Cette Main n est pas la pr c dente. 

Nous devons gagner du temps. 

Khal Drogo ne bougera pas 

avant la naissance de son fils. 

Vous les connaissez  ces barbares. 

Ajournez  dites vous. 

Je r ponds  h tez vous. 

la partie ne va pas se jouer

et ne s est jamais jou e ainsi. 

Premier arriv   

dernier parti. 

J admire votre assiduit . 

Vous vous d placez fort 

silencieusement. 

Nous avons tous nos qualit s  

Vous semblez bien seul  

Vous devriez vous rendre 

dans mon bordel  ce soir. 

Le premier gar on sera offert 

par la maison  

Vous confondez affaires et plaisir. 

Le croyez vous  

Tous ces oisillons qui  

gazouillent   vos oreilles... 

Et vous content tant de belles 

histoires... 

Fa tes moi confiance  

nous savons satisfaire 

tous les penchants  

Je n en doute pas. 

Lord Redwyne aime les tr s 

jeunes gar ons  ai je entendu dire. 

Je suis pourvoyeur 

de beaut  et... de discretion. 

Les deux ont leur importance. 

Bien que la beaut  soit une 

 notion tr s subjective... 

Es il exact que 

Ser Marlon de Tumblestone 

a un faible pour les amput s  

Tous les d sirs sont satisfaits 

lorsqu on a une bourse bien remplie. 

Une horrible rumeur court 

concernant un certain seigneur 

en demande de cadavres. 

Il doit  tre bien difficile 

de satisfaire un tel penchant. 

Rien que l organisation... 

Trouver de beaux cadavres 

avant qu ils ne pourrissent... 

Pour  tre pr cis  une telle chose 

ne me semble pas conforme 

aux lois  dict es par le Roi. 

Pour  tre pr cis. 

Dites moi  se pourrait il 

que quelqu un d tienne 

vos couilles dans une petite boite  

Je me suis souvent pos  la question. 

Je ne sais o  elles se trouvent. 

Nous avons pourtant  t  si proches. 

Assez parl  de moi. 

Comment allez vous 

depuis notre derni re rencontre  

Depuis que vous m avez vu 

ou depuis que je vous ai vu   

La derni re fois que 

je vous ai vu  

vous parliez   la Main du Roi. 

 Vous m avez vu de vos propres yeux  

 Des yeux qui travaillent pour moi. 

Les affaires en cours. 

Nous avons tous des raisons 

de nous entretenir avec Ned Stark. 

Nul n ignore l affection  

durable que vous portez 

  la femme de Lord Stark. 

Si la tentative de meurtre contre le 

fils Stark peut  tre reli e aux Lannister 

et que l on d couvre que  

vous avez incit  

les Stark a en venir 

  cette extr mit   

Un seul mot   la Reine... 

 J en fr mis d avance  

Mais voyez  vous  

il me semble que je vous ai vu  

encore plus r cemment que  

vous ne m avez vu. 

  Vraiment  

  Oui. 

Dans les premi res heures de la 

journ e Je me souviens tr s bien 

vous avoir vu vous entretenir 

avec Lord Stark dans ses appartements. 

Etiez vous sous le lit  

Peu de temps apr s  

vous avez accompagn   

un dignitaire  tranger... 

Les affaires du Royaume  

Bien entendu  vous avez des amis 

de l autre c t  du Detroit. 

Vous  tes originaire de 

cette r gion  apr s tout. 

Nous sommes amis  Lord Varys  

n est ce pas  

J aime   y croire. 

Vous imaginez le dilemme 

auquel je suis confront   

Que ferais je si le Roi se mettait 

  douter de mes amis  

Je me trouve   la crois e des chemins  

j ai le choix entre  tre loyal envers un ami  

ou  tre loyal envers le Royaume. 

  Oh je vous en prie. 

  Je suis dans une position o ... 

il suffirait d un simple mot au Roi... 

Qu  tes vous en train 

de manigancer  

Peu importe de quoi il s agit. 

H tez vous  

Mon fr re va arriver. 

Il se rend   un conseil r duit  

Voil  la nouvelle la plus 

d routante et de loin. 

Avez vous entendu  

Tire toi. 

Pas de mendiants  

Je ne suis pas une mendiante  

J habite ici. 

Il te faut une beigne pour 

comprendre ce que je te dis  

Je veux voir mon p re. 

Et moi je veux niquer la Reine 

pour mon plaisir. 

Tu veux voir ton p re  

mon gar on  

Il doit cuver sur le sol 

d une taverne  

ses amis doivent lui pisser dessus. 

Mon p re est la Main du Roi  

Je ne suis pas un gar on  

Je suis Arya Stark de Winterfell 

Si vous osez poser la main sur moi 

 et mon p re 

fera empaler vos t tes 

sur une pique. 

Allez vous me laisser entrer 

ou vous faut il 

des beignes pour comprendre. 

J ai lanc  la moiti  de ma garde 

  ta recherche  

Tu m avais pourtant promis... 

Ils ont dit qu ils allaient  

vous tuer. 

  Qui  

  Je ne les ai pas vus. 

  L un d eux  tait gros. 

  Oh  Arya. 

Je ne mens pas Ils ont dit 

que tu avais trouv  le b tard 

Que les loups et les lions allaient 

se d vorer et que l animal f roce... 

Il  tait question d un animal f roce. 

  O  te trouvais tu  

  Dans les oubliettes  

pr s des cranes de dragons. 

Que faisais tu dans  

les oubliettes  

Je chassais un chat. 

Veuillez m excuser  Messire. 

Un homme de la Garde de Nuit 

r clame audience  

Il dit que c est urgent. 

  Votre nom  l ami. 

  Yoren  pour vous servir. 

Votre fils  je suppose. 

Il vous ressemble. 

Je suis une fille  

C est Benjen qui vous envoie  

Personne ne m a envoy   

monseigneur. 

Je suis venu chercher des 

hommes pour le Mur. 

La racaille des cachots pourrait 

faire l affaire. 

Nous allons vous fournir 

des recrues. 

Merci monseigneur. 

Mais ce n est pas la raison de 

ma venue. 

Le sang de votre fr re Benjen 

est devenu noir... 

Ce qui fait de lui mon fr re 

autant que le v tre. 

C est pour lui que je suis venu 

au triple galop. 

J en ai presqu  tu  mon cheval. 

Les autres aussi chevauchent 

en ce moment. 

Toute la ville connaitra la  

 nouvelle d ici   demain. 

Quelle nouvelle  

Faudrait mieux  viter les 

t moins  monseigneur. 

Laisse nous. 

Nous reparlerons plus tard. 

Jory  ram ne la 

dans sa chambre. 

Venez  madame. 

Vous avez entendu votre p re. 

De combien de gardes dispose 

mon p re  

Ici    Port Landing  

. 

Vous ne laisseriez personne 

le tuer  n est ce pas  

Rien   craindre de ce c t  l   

jeune demoiselle. 

  Eh bien  

  Il s agit de votre femme  monseigneur. 

Elle a fait prisonnier le Lutin. 

Vous  tes bien loin de chez vous  

Lady Stark. 

Qui  tes vous  

Ser Vardis Egan  

chevalier du Val. 

 Lady Arryn 

vous attend t elle  

Je n ai gu re eu le temps 

de l informer de ma visite. 

Puis je vous demandez  

madame  

ce qu il fait en votre compagnie  

Il est la cause de cette pr cipitation. 

  Il est mon prisonnier. 

  Il ne ressemble gu re   un prisonnier. 

Ce sera   ma soeur d en juger. 

Oui  madame. 

En effet. 

Les eyri  sont consid r s 

comme imprenables. 

Donnez moi  hommes vaillants 

et des crampons 

et tu vas voir si elle 

est imprenable  

je vous aime bien. 

Lord Stark  your presence 

est requise 

dans la salle du Conseil restreint. 

Une audience a  t  fix e. 

Je dois d abord  m entretenir 

avec le Roi. 

Le Roi assiste au Conseil restreint  

monseigneur. 

Il vous a convoqu . 

  S agit il de ma femme  

  Non  monseigneur. 

Je crois que cela concerne 

Daenerys Targaryen. 

La garce est grosse  

  Tu parles d assassiner une enfant  

  Je te l avais dit. 

Je le sentais venir. 

Dans le Nord  je t avais pr venu  

et tu n as pas voulu entendre. 

Eh bien  tu vas le faire 

maintenant. 

Je les veux morts  

la m re et l enfant. 

Et cet imb cile de Vyseris aussi. 

Ets ce bien clair  

Je les veux morts tous les deux. 

Un pareil forfait te d shonererait 

  jamais. 

L honneur   

Je dois r gner sur les Sept Royaumes. 

Un Roi  

Sept Royaumes. 

Tu crois que c est l honneur 

qui permet la coh sion  

Tu crois que l honneur permet 

de maintenir la paix  

Non  c est la peur. 

La peur et le sang. 

Alors nous ne valons pas mieux 

que le Roi Fou. 

Assez  Ned. 

Il suffit. 

Tu veux faire assassiner une enfant 

parce que l Araign e 

a entendu une rumeur  

Ce n est pas une rumeur  monseigneur. 

La princesse est grosse. 

Et qui l affirme  

Ser Jorah Mormont. 

Il est conseiller aupr s des 

 Targaryen. 

Mormont  

Vous propagez les rumeurs 

d un traitre aux confins des terres 

et vous allez cela un fait. 

Jorah Mormont est un vendeur  

d esclaves  pas un traitre. 

Voil  qui fait peu de diff rence  

pour un homme d honneur. 

Il n a pas respect  les lois il a 

trahi sa famille et s est enfui.  

Nous devons commettre un crime 

et lui faire confiance  

Et s il dit juste  

Si elle a un fils  

Un Targaryen serait   la t te d une 

arm e de Dothraki... 

 Qu adviendra t il  

 Le D troit nous s pare. 

Je craindrai les Dothraki 

le jour o  leurs chevaux 

galoperont sur les fl ts. 

Ne rien faire  

C est ton condeil avis   

Ne rien faire jusqu au jour o  

nos ennemis d barqueront sur nos c tes  

Vous  tez mon conseil  

Conseillez  

Faites entendre raison  

  cet idiot . 

Je con ois vos r pugnances  

Monseigneur. 

Oui  sinc rement. 

Il est bien terrible 

de devoir envisager une chose vile. 

Cependant  si nous pr tendons 

gouverner   

il est des vil nies que nous devons 

assumer pour le bien du royaume. 

Si les Dieux accordent un fils 

  Daenerys  

le royaume saignera. 

Je ne veux aucun mal   cette fille 

mais  si les Dothraki 

venaient   nous envahir  

combien d innocents mourraient  

Combien de villes br leraient  

N est il pas plus sage 

et m me plus humain 

qu elle meure aujourd hui 

pour sauver des dizaines 

de milliers de vie. 

On aurait d  les faire tuer 

depuis longtemps. 

Quand vous couchez avec 

un laideron  

la meilleure chose   faire est de 

fermer les paupi res et h ter la besogne. 

Egorgez la. 

Et fin des probl mes. 

Je t ai suivi deux fois  

au combat  

sans la moindre h sitation. 

Sans arri res pens es. 

Mias je refuse de te suivre 

cette fois ci. 

Le Robert de mon enfance 

ne tremblait pas devant l ombre 

d un enfant   na tre. 

Je la veux morte. 

Je ne participerai pas 

  ce meurtre. 

Vous  tes la Main du Roi  

Lord Stark. 

Vous ferez ce que je vous ordonne 

ou je me trouverai une Main plus docile. 

Mes voeux l accompagnent  

Je te croyais un homme meilleur  

Robert. 

Dehors  

Dehors  maudit  

Je t ai assez vu. 

Retourne vite   Winterfell. 

Je vais faire empaler ta t te 

sur une pique. 

Je l y mettrai moi m me  

Tu crois que c est indigne de toi. 

Tu es trop fier et homme d honneur. 

Nous sommes en  guerre  

Je pars avec mes filles. 

Qu elles se pr parent. 

Agissez seul. 

  Ne demande aucune aide ext rieure. 

  Tout de suite  messire. 

Lord Baelish  Monseigneur. 

Sa Majest  a abond  sur votre 

personne 

apr s votre d part. 

Le mot  trahison  

a  t  prononc . 

Que puis je pour vous  

Quand repartez vous pour Winterfell  

Pourquoi  que vous importe  

Si vous  tes encore ici  

  la tomb e du jour  

je vous ferai rencontrer 

la derni re personne ayant 

parl  avec Jon Arryn 

avant qu il ne tombe malade. 

Si ceci est susceptible 

de vous int resser. 

Je n ai pas le temps. 

Une heure suffira mais 

faites comme bon vous semblera. 

R unissez tous nos gardes 

et qu ils demeurent 

devant les chambres de mes filles. 

  Qui sont tes deux meilleures  p es  

  Heward et Wyl. 

Trouve les et rejoins moi 

aux  curies. 

Tu l as amen  ici sans  

ma permission. 

Il pollue ma maison de sa  

 presence. 

Ta tante a mal agi  Robin. 

Tr s mal agi. 

Tu te souviens d elle  

n est ce pas  

N est il pas magnifique  

Et fort aussi. 

Jon le savait bien. 

Ses derniers mots ont  t   

 La graine est vigoureuse.  

Il voulait que chacun sache 

quel bon fils vigoureus 

allait devenir son fils. 

Regarde le. 

Le Seigneur du Val. 

Lysa  

Tu m as  crit pour me parler 

des Lannister. 

 Tu m as conseill e... 

 De rester loin d eux  

Pas d en faire venir un ici  

M re  

  C est lui  le vilain  

 oui  c est lui. 

Il est petit. 

C est Tyrion le Lutin 

de la maison Lannister. 

C est lui qui a tu  ton p re. 

Il a tu  la Main du Roi  

Oh  je l ai tu   lui aussi  

J ai  t  fort affair . 

Retiens ta langue  

Ces hommes sont les  

chevaliers du Val. 

Ils aimaient tous Jon Arryn 

et sont tous pr ts    

mourir pour moi. 

S il m arrive le moindre mal  

mon fr re Jaime fera en sorte qu ils 

s  xecutent. 

You can t hurt us. 

Personne ne peut nous faire du mal. 

Dites lui  m re  

  Dites lui. 

 Mon joli b b   

Il essaie juste de nous effrayer. 

Les Lannister sont tous des menteurs. 

Personne ne fera de mal 

  mon b b . 

M re. 

Je veux voir voler 

le vilain. 

Tu le verras peut  tre  

mon petit b b . 

Cet homme est mon prisonnier. 

Je ne veux pas qu on le maltraite. 

Ser Vardis  

L h te de ma soeur est las  

descendez le cachot. 

Qu il s y repose  

Pr sentez lui Mord. 

Dors le nabot. 

Dors bien  

le nabot. 

Lord Stark peut s estimer 

heureux d avoir encore sa t te. 

Robert va pester pendant quelques jours 

mais il ne fera rien. 

Il l aime trop. 

Tu es jaloux. 

Tu ne vas me blesser  

Uniquement si ma lame glisse. 

  Tu me pr f res comme  a  

Si tu me veux imberbe  tu devrais 

peut  tre te choisir un jeune gar on. 

C est toi que je veux. 

Mon fr re estime qu on est pas un 

homme tant qu on n a pas combattu. 

Il me traite comme si  

j  tais un enfant g t . 

Et que dire de toi  

Loras Tyrell  

le Chevalier des Fleurs  

A combien de guerres as tu 

particip   

Combien ton p re a t il 

d bours  ton armure  

Ne bouge pas. 

Robert et Stannis ne cessent de 

r p ter que je ne suis pas assez dur. 

Que je d faille   la 

vue du sang... 

Tu as vomi quand l oeil du gar on 

a  t  transperc  dans la m l e. 

Son oeil  tait sorti 

de son orbite  

Il n aurait pas d  participer 

  la m l e s il ne savait pas se battre. 

Facile   dire pour toi. 

Nous ne sommes pas aussi dou s 

que toi avec une  p e entre les mains. 

Personne ne m en a fait cadeau. 

Je suis bon parce que 

je m entraine 

tous les jours depuis que je 

suis en  ge de tenir un b ton. 

Je pourrais m entrainer toute  

la journ e  tous les jours  

je ne serais jamais aussi 

bon que toi. 

Nous ne le saurons jamais  

 Partout  

 Partout. 

Alors  comment  a s est termin   

La fille Targaryen va mourir  

C est n cessaire. Aussi d plaisant 

que cela puisse para tre. 

Robert ne semble gu re  

perturb . 

A chaque fois qu il 

parle de la tuer  

on dirait que la table du conseil 

est en  rection  

Dommage que sa femme ne lui  

fasse pas le m me effet. 

Son argent lui provoque 

ce type de r action  

Il faut bien l admettre  

Les Lannister sont la pire 

vermine suffisante 

que la terre ait port   

mais  ils sont outrageusement  

riches. 

Je suis outrageusement riche. 

Pas autant que les Lannister. 

Mais bien plus que toi. 

Robert veut que je 

l accompagne   la chasse. 

 a a dur  deux semaines  

la derni re fois. 

On a err  sous la pluie 

pendant des jours et des jours 

pour qu il puisse enfoncer 

son pieu dans de la chair. 

Robert aime cette boucherie. 

 Et il est le Roi. 

 Comment est ce possible  

 Il aime tuer. 

Et il  tait bon dans ce domaine. 

Sais tu qui devrait  tre Roi  

 Sois un peu  s rieux. 

 Je le suis. 

Mon p re pourrait te 

financer. 

Je n ai jamais particip    une 

guerre mais je me battrai pour toi. 

Je suis quatri me dans le rang 

de succession. 

Et o  se trouvait Robert  

dans le rang de succession au tr ne  

Joffrey est un monstre. 

  Tommen n a que  ans. 

  Stannis  

Stannis n a pas de cervelle. 

Il est malgr  tout mon ain . 

  Que fais tu  

  Regarde. 

Tu m as entaill . 

Ce n est que du sang. 

Nous avons tous  a en commun. 

Parfois  un peu de sang coule. 

Si tu deviens Roi  

tu en verras beaucoup. 

Tu vas devoir t y habituer. 

Allez  regarde. 

Les gens t aiment. 

Suffisammant pour te servir 

parce que tu es bon pour eux. 

Ils veulent  tre   tes c t s. 

Tu fais ce qui doit  tre 

accompli. 

Mais  tu ne t en glorifies pas. 

Tu n aimes pas tuer. 

O  est il  crit 

que le pouvoir 

est l apanage des vauriens. 

Que les tr nes sont r serv s 

  ceux qui sont d test s et craints  

Tu serai un magnifique Roi. 

 Je suis d sol e que ton union 

avec Ned Stark n est pas fonctionn . 

Vous alliez si bien ensemble  

Voil  qui vous rend heureuse 

et je m en r jouis  

Sans une Main  

Ce sera un d sastre. 

Vous allez maintenant me dire 

que votre fr re Jaime  

est pr t   remplir cette fonction. 

Non. 

Il n est pas assez s rieux. 

Je reconnais cette qualit  

  Ned Stark  

Il est suffisamment s rieux. 

Cela en valait il vraiment la peine  

Vous l avez perdu. 

Je ne sais pas. 

Mais je sais ceci  

Si la fille Targaryen convainc 

son cavalier de mari de nous envahir  

et que la horde Dothraki 

traverse le D troit  

Nous serons incapables 

de les arr ter. 

Les Dothraki ne sont pas des marins. 

C est connu de tous. 

Ils ne sont pas disciplin s. 

Ils n ont pas d armure. 

Ils n ont pas de catapultes. 

Tu es rus e. 

Tu me parles et c est la voix 

de ton p re que j entendq. 

Mon p re est il dans l erreur  

Imaginons que 

Viserys Targaryen d barque 

avec   Dothraki 

brailleurs   ses c t s. 

On se terre dans nos ch teaux. 

Une sage d cision. 

Il faudrait  tre fou 

pour affronter les Dothraki 

sur un champ de bataille. 

Pendant que nous sommes 

dans nos ch teaux  

ils vont de ville en ville  pillant 

et br lant tout sur leur passage  

et tuant tous ceux que nous ne  

pouvons prot ger derri re nos murs. 

Ils volent nos r coltes  

notre b tail. 

Ils transforment nos femmes et 

enfants en esclaves. 

Pendant combien de temps   crois tu  

que le peuple des Sept couronnes 

soutiendra un Roi absent  

un Roi couard  

qui se cache derri re ses hauts murs  

Et si le peuple d cide  finalement 

que Viserys Targaryen 

est le monarque l gitime  

Nous sommes plus nombreux qu eux. 

Quel est le plus grand chiffre  

Cinq ou un  

Cinq. 

Cinq... 

Un. 

Une arm e. 

Une v ritable arm e 

unie derri re un homme 

avec un seul et m me but. 

Notre but est mort 

avec le Roi Fou. 

A pr sent  nous avons des arm es 

  la solde d hommes fortun s. 

Ils veulent tous quelque 

chose de diff rent. 

Ton p re veut r gner sur le monde. 

Ned Stark veut fuir 

et s enterrer dans la neige. 

Et toi que veux tu  

Nous n avons pas connu de vraies 

batailles depuis  ans. 

Les coups de poignard dans le dos  

 a ne pr pare pas au combat... 

Le royaume ne connait plus que  a. 

Coups de poignard dans le dos  

intrigues  

l che cul et cupidit . 

Je me demande parfois comment 

il tient encore debout. 

C est gr ce   notre mariage. 

Et nous voil   

 ans plus tard  

faisant en sorte qu il tienne 

encore debout. 

Tu n es pas lasse  

Si  chaque jour. 

Pendant combien de temps 

la haine peut elle sauver un  difice  

  c est bien long. 

En effet. 

En effet. 

A quoi ressemblait elle  

Tu n as jamais pos  

la moindre question. 

Pourquoi  

Au d but  le seul fait de prononcer 

son nom 

sembalit la ramener   la vie. 

J ai cru qu en ne parlant  

pas d elle  

elle quitterait tes pens es. 

Quand j ai compris que  

 a n arriverait pas  

J ai refus   par d pit  

de parler d elle. 

Je ne voulais pas te donner 

cette satisfaction. 

Tu ne devais pas savoir 

que je m int ressais   elle. 

Mon d pit ne t affectais nullement. 

Je crois m me que tu  en jubilais. 

Pourquoi maintenant  alors  

Quel mal pourrait nous faire 

le fant me de Lyanna Stark  

Nous nous sommes d j  bien assez  

fait souffrir. 

Tu veux connaitre 

l horrible v rit   

Je ne sais m me plus 

  quoi elle ressemblait. 

Je ne sais qu une chose. 

Elle  tait tout ce que je d sirais. 

Elle m a  t  enlev e 

et les Sept Royaumes 

ne sauraient combler le vide. 

J ai  prouv  des sentiments 

pour toi  autrefois. 

Je le sais. 

M me apr s la perte de notre 

premier fils. 

Cela a dur  assez longtemps. 

Notre histoire avait elle 

la moindre chance  

Y a til eu moment o  

cela aurait  t  possible  

Non. 

Que ressens tu en sachant  a. 

Je ne ressens rien. 

Elle lui ressemble 

n est ce pas  monseigneur  

Elle a son nez  ses cheveux 

noirs. 

Oui. 

Dites lui  quand vous le 

verrez  Monseigneur. 

Si vous le voulez bien  

dites lui comme elle est belle. 

Je lui dirai. 

Et dites lui que je suis 

all e avec personne d autre. 

je le jure   monseigneur 

Les dieux m en sont t moins. 

Je ne veux pas de bijoux  

Ni rien. 

Je ne veux que lui. 

Le Roi a toujours  t  bon 

pour moi. 

Jon arryn t a rendu visite. 

Que voulait il  

Ce n  tait pas ce genre d homme  

Monseigneur 

Il voulait juste savoir si 

l enfant  tait heureux  

en bonne sant . 

Il me parait en parfaite sant . 

La petite ne manquera de rien. 

Les bordels sont de bien meilleurs 

investissements que les bateaux. 

Selon mon avis. 

Une catin   a ne coule pas  

Que savez vous des b tards 

du Roi Robert  

H  bien  d abord  

qu il en a plus que vous. 

  Combien  

  Est ce important  

Si vous baisez assez de femmes  

attendez vous   ce genre de cadeau. 

Pourquoi Jon Arryn recherchait il 

ces enfants  

Il  tait la Main du Roi.Le Roi 

a d  lui demander de prendre soin d eux. 

L amour paternel  

Viens. 

  Jory  

  Monseigneur. 

une belle meute de loups. 

N avancez pas  Ser. 

Cet homme est la Main du Roi. 

Etait la Main du Roi. 

Ce qu il est maintenant  

je ne le sais. 

Seigneur de quelque contr e 

lointaine. 

Qu est ce que cela signifie 

 Lannister  

Retournez   l int rieur  

bien   l abri. 

Je suis   la recherche 

de mon fr re. 

Vous vous souvenez de mon  

fr re  n est ce pas Lord Stark  

Blond la langue bien pendue  

plut t petit. 

Je me le rappelle fort bien. 

Il semblerait qu on lui ait  

cherch  noise sur la route. 

Vous ne sauriez pas ce qui 

lui est arriv   

Il a  t  captur  sur mes ordres. 

afin de r pondre de ses crimes. 

Messires. 

Je ram ne le guet. 

Approchez  Stark. 

J aimerais autant vous voir 

mourir l  p e   la main. 

 Si vous menacez de nouveau Monseigneur. 

  Menacez  

Je vais entailler votre 

seigneur  

des couilles   la t te et d couvrir 

de quoi sont faits les Stark. 

Si vous me tuez  

votre fr re est un homme mort. 

Vous avez raison. 

Je le veux vivant. 

Tuez ses hommes. 

Mon fr re  Lord Stark ... 

Rendez le nous  

What was she like  

She... 

She had red hair. 

Oh  

  How big were her feet  

  What do you want me to say  

I want you to tell me 

what it was like to have someone. 

To be with someone. 

To love someone and have them  

love you back. 

We re all gonna die  

a lot sooner than I d planned. 

You re the closest 

I ll ever get to knowing. 

So you and Gilly never  

No. 

She just had a baby. 

And she never offered. 

But if she had  

you would have  

You d have broken your vows  

The interesting thing is  

our vows never 

specifically forbid 

intimate relations with women. 

What  

 I shall take no wife   yes  that s in there. 

There s no denying that. 

 I shall father no children.  

It s very specific. 

But what do our vows 

have to say about other 

activities is open 

to interpretation. 

I don t think Ser Alliser 

cares much for interpretation. 

Anyway  there s nothing 

for him to interpret. 

We didn t. 

So what s it like  

It s... 

there s this person  

this whole other person. 

And you re wrapped up in them 

and they re wrapped up in you. 

And you... 

for a little... 

for a little while  

you re more than just you. 

You re... I don t know. 

I m not a bleeding poet. 

No  you re really not. 

What did I get for it  

An arrow six inches 

from my heart. 

There ll be arrows for all 

of us soon  I imagine. 

There will. 

They ve already done the worst 

thing to me they could ever do. 

Go get some sleep  Sam. 

I ll take this watch. 

Did I ever tell you about her  

  My Sheila  

  Yes. 

That was a night to remember. 

Of course   

I d had a good bit to drink. 

Her fangs were sharp  

but she knew how to use them. 

And she was nice 

and soft down below. 

No  she was no ordinary beast. 

Many is the man who... 

I know you never fucked a bear. 

You know you never 

fucked a bear. 

Right now I don t want to think 

about the bear you never fucked. 

Right now all I want 

to think about 

is each one of these arrows finding 

its way into a crow s heart. 

We could be waiting 

here a while. 

Good. 

The longer we wait  

the more arrows I ll have. 

But they came up here to our land 

and put up a big wall 

and said it was theirs. 

Then they started 

hunting us down. 

This time  we re the ones 

doing the hunting. 

You ve got a lot 

to say about killing. 

Even more words than arrows. 

Back in those villages  I killed 

just as many of them as you did. 

More  I reckon. 

Yes  but none of those 

were your crow lover. 

I probably killed him already. 

So you ve said. 

And if not  

the only thing left of him is gonna be 

his fun bits hanging around my neck. 

More words. 

Know what I think 

you do when you see him  

Serve him up a nice  

juicy slice of ginger minge. 

What  you ve been thinking 

about that ginger minge  

Wondering what I taste like  

Maybe I have. 

Jon Snow is mine. 

Anyone else tries to kill him  

I ll have an arrow for them. 

And not one of your bald friends 

is fast enough to stop me. 

And what is it that couldn t wait  

until morning  Tarly  

Maester Aemon. 

  How did you know... 

  That it was you  

Who else but Samwell Tarly 

would be wasting candles 

to read in the middle 

of the night  

  Let me help you. 

  Oh  no need. 

I know my way 

around this library 

better than any other 

place in Castle Black. 

Thousands of books 

and no eyes to read them. 

Old age is a wonderful 

source of ironies... 

...if nothing else. 

But you didn t 

answer my question. 

What are you reading  

Maester Faull. 

Ah  the wildlings. 

I can assure you that 

the closest Maester Faull 

ever got to a wildling 

was this very library. 

But what he says 

about what they do  

it s all true. 

It s exactly what the survivors 

of their raids report. 

Yes  imagine the stories 

wildlings tell about us. 

Love is the death of duty. 

I told that to your friend 

Jon Snow once. 

He didn t listen 

and neither did you. 

Which is why you ve abandoned 

your watch atop the Wall... 

to come here and read 

about the terrible things 

that may have happened 

to the girl you love. 

I don t... love her. 

  Yes  you do. 

  No. 

Yes  you do. 

Heard it in your voice  

when you first brought her to me. 

I remember how it sounds. 

I was in love once. 

You were  

You can imagine 

all manner of horrors 

befalling that poor 

girl and her child. 

Is it so difficult to imagine 

that an old person was once  

more or less  like you  

I m sorry  Maester. 

I didn t mean it like that. 

Do you know who I was 

before I came here  

What I could have been here 

if I d only said the word  

Of course you do. 

I met many girls 

when I was Aemon Targaryen. 

A future king always does. 

Some of them were quite forward 

in their attempts 

to win my affections. 

One of them succeeded. 

I was very young. 

Who was she  

Ah. 

I could tell you 

everything about her. 

Who she was  

how we met  

the color of her eyes  

and the shape of her nose. 

I can see her... 

right in front of me. 

She s more real than you are. 

We could spend all night 

trading tales of lost loves. 

Nothing makes the past 

a sweeter place to visit 

than the prospect 

of imminent death. 

Go to bed  Tarly. 

 i  Sorry  I can t open the 

gate for anybody. Orders.  i  

 i  You don t understand. 

They killed everyone.  i  

 i Everyone but me and my baby.  i  

 i They re out there.  i  

 i I saw them on my way here.  i  

 i They may have seen me.  

They may have followed me. Please.  i  

 i I m sorry  I can t.  i  

 i  If they find us out here   

you don t know...  i  

Pyp  

Open the gate. 

  I can t. 

  Sam  is that you  

Yes. 

Thorne gave me strict 

orders to not open the gate. 

Oh  Pyp  open the fucking gate  

I never heard you curse before. 

Yes  well  best get used to it. 

Are you all right  

Shh  you re all right. 

Yeah. Of course you are  

my brave little fella. 

  It was horrible. 

  I m so  so sorry. 

I didn t know until I got back. 

Don t let them 

send me away  Sam. 

  Never. 

  I know there s no women allowed. 

Anyone who tries to throw you out 

will be having words with me. 

From now on  wherever you go  

I go  too. 

 i Get ready   i  

 i    Open the gate  

   Ready yourselves   i  

 i Make haste   i  

 i    Prepare  

   Up on the Wall   i  

 i Quickly  

Up  Up   i  

 i How many  

How many are there   i  

Beyond the trees  

It s time. 

Light them up  

Light them all  

Move  

Pick up the pace  

 i Come on  come on.  i  

Here we go  boys  there s one. 

Let s go. 

There s two. 

Let s get the next load. 

That s the last 

of the oil  Ser Alliser. 

  you say  

Yes  Ser. 

You can say it if you like. 

We should have sealed the 

tunnel while we had the chance  

like you suggested. 

It was a difficult 

decision either way  Ser. 

Do you know what leadership 

means  Lord Snow  

It means that the person in 

charge gets second guessed 

by every clever little 

twat with a mouth. 

But if he starts 

second guessing himself  

that s the end... 

for him  for the 

clever little twats  

for everyone. 

This is not the end. 

Not for us. 

Not if you lot do your duty 

for however long it takes 

to beat them back. 

And then you get 

to go on hating me 

and I get to go on wishing 

your wildling whore 

had finished the job. 

 i You ll be safe down here.  i  

I ll check on you 

as soon as I can. 

You re leaving me again  

I m not leaving you. 

You re going up there and we re 

staying down here. That s leaving. 

You said from now on 

we d stay together. 

I... I didn t mean in the same room. 

What are you going 

to do out there  

  Help my brothers. 

  How  

You re going to fight the 

free folk when they come  

They ll kill you. In Mole s Town   

they killed everyone. 

I can t just hide here with you 

while they re fighting out there. 

Why not  You won t 

matter up there. 

You will down here. 

I am a man of 

the Night s Watch  Gilly. 

I made a promise 

to defend the Wall 

and I have to keep it... 

because that s what men do. 

Promise me you won t die. 

I promise you I won t die. 

There s a lot more wildlings on the 

other side of the Wall than this side. 

We ve got loads 

of weapons and things. 

It s the perfect place 

for us to be. 

I ve never thrown 

a spear before. 

I ve never held a sword 

with a proper edge. 

This is no place for me to be. 

You re not afraid  

Of course I m afraid. 

There s a band of wildlings 

coming to kill us. 

If you re afraid 

of a band of wildlings  

how in seven hells did you 

manage to kill a white walker  

I didn t know 

I was going to kill it. 

But I had to do something. 

I didn t have any choice. 

It was going to kill Gilly 

and take the baby. 

If someone had asked 

me my name right then  

I wouldn t have known. 

I wasn t Samwell Tarly anymore. 

I wasn t a steward 

in the Night s Watch 

or son of Randyll Tarly 

or any of that. 

I was nothing at all. 

And when you re nothing at all  

there s no more reason 

to be afraid. 

But you re afraid now  

Yes  well... 

I m not nothing anymore. 

Most of their men are up top. 

Didn t count more than  down here. 

Leftovers. 

They got a big fat one and a 

little bony one manning the front. 

How high are the walls  

Well  we ll be up and over before 

they know what s happened. 

Let s kill some crows  

Come on  

 i Come on  brothers   i  

Archers nock. 

Everyone else hold. 

Grenn  no  

I said nock and hold  you cunts

If you keep missing  we will. 

Come on  

Come on  

Brothers  

 generations 

have defended this castle. 

She s never fallen before. 

She will not fall tonight. 

Those are Thenns at our walls. 

They eat the flesh 

of the men they kill. 

Do you want to fill 

the belly of a Thenn tonight  

No  

Tonight we fight. 

And when the sun rises  

I promise you  

Castle Black will stand  

The Night s Watch will stand. 

With me now  

Now with me  

No discipline. 

No training. 

Gang of thieves  

that s all this is. 

I commanded the City Watch 

of King s Landing. 

Those men obeyed orders. 

We can t just let them attack the gate  

The bars of those gates are 

four inches of cold rolled steel. 

Those are giants riding 

mammoths down there  

Do you think your cold rolled 

steel is gonna stop them  

No such thing as giants. 

A story for the children. 

Brother Slynt. 

We just got word that Ser Alliser  

needs you below. 

You re the most experienced man 

he s got  Ser  and he needs you. 

Needed below  

Yes. Yes. 

Archers  nock your arrows  

 i Nock arrows   i  

Draw  

Loose  

  They won t summit before dawn. 

  How do you know that  

Because I ve made that climb. 

I think they re in a bigger 

hurry than you were. 

 i Hold the bridge   i  

 i Hold  wait for it   i  

 i Come on with the rocks   i  

Nock  

Draw  

Loose  

Down

To the gate. 

Come on  let s move.

I got one  right through the heart. 

He s dead. 

  Oh  is it over  

  No. 

Well  then... 

You re all right. 

You re all right. 

I ll get help. 

Shh. Shh. 

Maester Aemon is coming. 

He s gonna make it all right. 

Shh. Shh. 

  Now. 

  Now  

The outer gate won t hold. 

Take five men  

hold the inner gate. 

Aye. 

Hold the gate. 

If they make it through... 

They won t. 

Come on  Hill. 

And you  Cooper. 

You three  on me. 

Come on  you lazy bastards. 

Oil. 

Oil on the ramp  

Protect the gate  

Get him inside. 

Hold the fucking gate  

Hold it  

We need more men down here. 

  We have to hold the gate. 

  But we need men here. 

Tell Jon. 

He s in command. 

Let s go. 

Get me to the top  

You hear me   

Your name s Olly  right  

Listen to me  Olly. 

Get me to the top. 

And when we give the signal  

bring us back down. 

You hear me  

Find a weapon  Olly. 

Fight them. 

Clear the way  

Let s go  

  Out of the way  

  Get out of here  

Cut the rope  

Wait  No  

 i   We need more archers. 

  Here I am.  i  

 i   Come on. 

  Quickly.  i  

What are you doing up here  

The wildlings 

are over the walls. 

Ser Alliser s fallen. 

The castle won t stand 

much longer. 

Edd  you have the Wall. 

If they try the mammoths again   

drop fire on them. 

If the climbers get too high  

drop the scythe on them. 

Come  brothers. 

Now fight with me  

Might as well enjoy 

our last night  right  boys  

Light the fuckers up  

Nock  Draw  

Loose  

How are we gonna stop that  

Shot  arrows in him already. 

You heard Jon. 

We hold the gate. 

Jon Snow s not Lord Commander. 

We hold the gate  

Mother  save me. 

Father  save me. 

The gods aren t down here. 

It s the six of us. 

You hear me  

No  please. 

Night gathers 

and now my watch begins. 

It shall not end until my death. 

I shall take no wife  

hold no lands  

father no children. 

I shall wear no crown 

and win no glory. 

I shall live and die at my post. 

I am the sword 

in the darkness. 

I am the watcher on the walls. 

I am the shield that guards 

the realms of men. 

I pledge my life and honor 

to the Night s Watch 

for this night 

and all the nights to come  

I don t want you out there. 

You can t protect me forever. 

There won t be anywhere 

to hide if the castle falls. 

I need him more than I need you. 

We need you  boy. 

Ha  

Jon Snow. 

Hush. 

Don t talk. 

Do you remember the cave  

We should have 

stayed in the cave. 

We ll go back there. 

You know nothing  Jon Snow. 

Drop the scythe  boys  

  Hoist her up. 

 i   Hoist her up   i  

They ve had enough 

for one night. 

Don t cheer too loud. 

They still outnumber us 

  to one. 

Tormund. 

It s over. 

Let it end. 

This is how a man ends. 

Put him in chains. 

We ll question him later. 

I should have thrown you... 

from the top of the Wall  boy  

Aye. 

You should have. 

Whoa  it s me. 

It s me. 

I promised you  didn t I  

We held them off. 

For one night. 

This is a great victory. 

A great victory  

Mance was testing our defenses. 

He almost made it through. 

And he has more giants. 

He has more mammoths. 

He has   times as many men. 

They ll hit us again tonight. 

Maybe we can hold them 

off for a day or two  

but we ll never beat them. 

Where are we going  

Going to find Mance. 

To fi... 

you can t do that. 

No one gave you any orders. 

Who s left to give orders  

The wildling army s only 

an army because of Mance. 

He united  warring tribes. 

Without Mance  

they lose their leader. 

They lose their purpose.  

They go back to fighting each other. 

Scatter back to their homes. 

Without Mance  

You re going to kill him  

I m gonna try. 

They ll never let you 

within  yards of him. 

And even if they did  even 

if you managed to kill him... 

They ll kill me  If I don t 

go  they ll kill me anyway. 

They ll kill 

the rest of us  too. 

They won t just kill you. 

They ll boil you. 

They ll flay you. 

They ll make it last days. 

You re right. 

It s a bad plan. 

What s your plan  

They held the gate. 

Get some brothers 

down here to help you. 

We need to burn the bodies. 

Raise the outer gate. 

Then lower it again 

as soon as I m out. 

What are you doing  

I promised Mormont 

I d never lose it again. 

In case I don t come back. 

Jon. 

Come back. 

Tell them all to stop. 

For how long  

Until I command them 

otherwise. 

You re learning 

to talk like a Queen. 

Not a Queen. 

A Khaleesi. 

Lord Snow here 

grew up in a castle 

spitting down 

on the likes of you. 

Everybody knew 

what this place was  

but no one told me   

no one but you. 

The Khaleesi 

have baby inside her. 

It is true. 

Her belly start to swell. 

I need to ride to Qohor. 

What did Aaerys Targaryen say 

when you stabbed him 

in the back  

He said the same thing 

he d been saying for hours   

 burn them all.  

My brother instructs us 

to stage a tournament 

in honor of Lord Stark s appointment 

as Hand of the King. 

This tournament is an extravagance 

we cannot afford. 

I m leaving this morning. 

My job is out there. 

  I won t let you down. 

  You re not going. 

Here  a man gets what he earns 

when he earns it. 

I don t take orders 

from savages or their sluts. 

I don t want my brother harmed. 

Mormont  kill these 

Dothraki dogs  

We ve come to a dangerous place. 

We must protect ourselves. 

Ah  

We allow the Northerners 

too much power. 

A good King knows 

when to save his strength 

and when to destroy 

his enemies. 

So you agree... 

The Starks are enemies  

Everyone who isn t us 

is an enemy. 

  Do you know whose dagger this is  

  Littlefinger   i I do.  i

  We have visitors. 

  I don t want to see anyone. 

Really  

If I was cooped up all day 

with no one but this old bat 

for company  I d go mad. 

Anyway  you don t have a choice. 

Robb s waiting. 

  I don t want to go. 

  Neither do I. 

But Robb s 

Lord of Winterfell  

which means I do what he says  

and you do what I say. 

Hodor  

  Hodor  

  Help Bran down the hall. 

 i Hodor.  i  

I must say I received a slightly 

warmer welcome on my last visit. 

Any man of The Night s Watch 

is welcome at Winterfell. 

Any man of The Night s Watch  

but not I  eh  boy  

I m not your boy  

Lannister. 

I m Lord of Winterfell 

while my father is away. 

Then you might learn a lord s courtesy. 

So it s true. 

Hello  Bran. 

Do you remember anything 

about what happened  

He has no memory 

of that day. 

  Curious. 

  Why are you here 

would your charming companion 

be so kind as to kneel  

  My neck is beginning to hurt. 

  Kneel  Hodor. 

  Do you like to ride  Bran  

  Yes. 

Well  I mean 

I  i did  i  like to. 

  The boy has lost the use of his legs. 

  What of it  

With the right horse and saddle  

even a cripple can ride. 

  I m not a cripple. 

  Then I m not a dwarf. 

My father will 

rejoice to hear it. 

I have a gift 

for you. 

Give that to your saddler. 

He ll provide the rest. 

You must shape 

the horse to the rider. 

 i Start with a yearling  i  

 i and teach it to respond  i  

 i to the reins  i  

 i and to the boy s voice.  i  

Will I really be 

able to ride  

You will. 

On horseback you will be 

as tall as any of them. 

Is this some kind of trick  

Why do you want to help him  

I have a tender spot 

in my heart 

for cripples  bastards 

and broken things. 

 i You ve done my brother  i  

 i a kindness.  i  

The hospitality 

of Winterfell is yours. 

Spare me your false courtesies  

Lord Stark. 

There s a brothel 

outside your walls. 

There I ll find a bed and both 

of us can sleep easier. 

Couldn t resist 

some Northern ass  

If you like redheads  

ask for Ros. 

Come to see me off  Greyjoy  

Kind of you. 

Your master doesn t seem 

to like Lannisters. 

  He s not my master. 

  No  of course not. 

What happened here  

Where is Lady Stark  

Why didn t she receive me  

  She wasn t feeling well. 

  She s not in Winterfell  is she  

  Where did she go  

  My Lady s whereabouts   

My Lady  

Your loyalty to your captors 

is touching. 

Tell me  how do you think 

balon Greyjoy would feel 

if he could see his only 

surviving son has turned lackey  

I still remember seeing 

my father s fleet 

burn in Lannisport. 

I believe your uncles 

were responsible  

Must have been a pretty sight. 

Nothing prettier than watching 

sailors burn alive. 

Yes  a great victory 

for your people. 

  Shame how it all turned out. 

  We were outnumbered  to one   

a stupid rebellion then. 

I suppose your father 

realized that 

when your brothers 

died in battle. 

Now here you are  

your enemy s squire. 

  Careful  imp. 

  I ve offended you. 

Forgive me  it s been 

a rough morning. 

Anyway  don t despair. 

I m a constant disappointment 

to my own father 

and I ve learned 

to live with it. 

Your next tumble with Ros is on me. 

I ll try not 

to wear her out. 

 i Shoulder  legs.  i  

 i Leg  shoulder  leg.  i  

 i Left foot forward.  i  

 i Good.  i  

Now pivot as you 

deliver the stroke. 

Put all your weight 

behind it. 

What in seven hells 

is that  

 i They ll need an eighth hell  i  

 i to fit him in.  i  

Tell them 

your name. 

Samwell Tarly  

of Horn Hill   

I mean  I was of Horn Hill. 

  I ve come to take the black. 

  Come to take the black pudding. 

Well  you couldn t be 

any worse than you look. 

Rast... 

 i See what he can do.  i  

I yield. 

  Please  no more. 

  On your feet. 

Pick up your sword. 

Hit him till he 

finds his feet. 

It seems they ve run short of 

poachers and thieves down South. 

   i Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.  i  

  Jon  

 i Again  harder.  i  

I yield  

Enough  

 i He yielded.  i  

Looks like 

the bastard s in love. 

All right then  

Lord Snow  

you wish to defend your lady love  

let s make it an exercise. 

You two. Three of you ought 

to be sufficient 

to make 

lady piggy squeal. 

All you ve got to do is 

get past the bastard. 

  Are you sure you want to do this  

  No. 

Yield yield yield  

I yield. 

We re done 

for today. 

Go clean the armory. 

That s all 

you re good for. 

  Well fought  

  Piss off. 

Did he hurt you  

I ve had worse. 

You can call me Sam... 

If you want. 

  My mother calls me Sam   

  it s not going to get any easier  you know  

You re going to have 

to defend yourself. 

Why didn t you get up 

and fight  

I wanted to. 

   i I just couldn t.  i  

  Why not  

I m a coward. 

  My father always says so. 

  The Wall s no place for cowards. 

You re right. 

I m sorry. 

I just... wanted 

to thank you. 

A bloody coward. 

People saw us 

talking to him. 

Now they ll think 

we re cowards too. 

You re too stupid 

to be a coward. 

  You re too stupid to be a   

  Quick now  

before summer s over. 

C mere  

Hyah hyah  

Vaes Dothrak   

the city of the horselords. 

A pile of mud. 

Mud and shit 

and twigs   

  best these savages can do. 

  These are  i my  i  people now. 

You shouldn t 

call them savages. 

I ll call them what I like  

because they re  i my  i  people. 

This is my army. 

Khal Drogo is marching the 

wrong way with my army. 

If my brother  i was  i  given 

an army of Dothraki  

could you conquer 

the Seven Kingdoms  

The Dothraki have never 

crossed the Narrow Sea. 

 i They fear any water  i  

 i their horses can t drink.  i  

But if they did  

King Robert is fool enough 

to meet them in open battle  

 i but the men  i  

 i advising him are different.  i  

  And you know these men  

  I fought beside them once  

 i long ago.  i  

Now Ned Stark wants my head. 

He drove me 

from my land. 

You sold slaves. 

Aye. 

  Why  

  I had no money 

and an expensive wife. 

And where is she now  

In another place  

with another man. 

  Your Grace  

  Yes  my dear  

They call you 

the Last Dragon... 

They do. 

You have dragon s blood 

in your veins  

It s entirely possible. 

What happened to the dragons  

I was told that brave men 

killed them all. 

The brave men 

didn t kill dragons. 

The brave men 

rode them. 

Rode them from Valyria 

to build the greatest civilization 

this world 

has ever seen. 

The breath 

of the greatest dragon 

forged the Iron Throne  

which the usurper is 

keeping warm for me. 

The swords 

of the vanquished  

a thousand of them... 

Melted together 

like so many candles. 

I have always wanted 

to see a dragon. 

There is nothing in the world 

that I would rather see. 

Really. 

Why dragons  

They can fly. 

And wherever they are  

just a few flaps of their wings 

and they re 

somewhere else... 

Far away. 

And they can kill. 

Anyone or anything that 

tries to hurt them 

gets burned away to nothing... 

...Like so many candles. 

Ow. 

Yes. 

Seeing a dragon 

would make me very happy. 

Well  after  years 

in a pleasure house  

I imagine just seeing 

the sky makes you happy. 

I was not locked in. 

I have seen things. 

  What have you seen  

  I ve seen... 

A man from Asshai with a dagger 

of real dragonglass. 

  Ooh. 

  I ve seen a man who could 

change his face the way that 

other men change their clothes. 

And I ve seen a pirate 

who wore his weight in gold 

and whose ship had 

sails of colored silk. 

So... 

Have you seen one  

  A pirate ship  

  A dragon. 

No. 

No  the last one died many years 

before I was born. 

I ll tell you 

what I have seen  

Their skulls. 

They used to decorate 

the throne room in the Red Keep. 

When I was very young  

just three or four  

my father used 

to walk me down the rows 

and I d recite 

their names for him. 

When I got them all right  

he d give me a sweet. 

The ones closest to the door were 

the last ones they were able to hatch 

and they were all 

stunted and wrong. 

Skulls no bigger 

than dog skulls. 

But as you got closer 

to the Iron Throne... 

They got bigger 

and bigger and bigger. 

There was Ghiscar 

and Valryon  

Vermithrax  

Essovius   

Archonei  

Meraxes  

Vhagar... 

And Balerion the dread... 

...Whose fire forged 

the Seven Kingdoms 

into one. 

What happened 

to the skulls  

I don t know. 

The usurper had them 

smashed to powder  I expect. 

Scattered to the wind. 

That s very sad. 

Yes  it is. 

What did I buy you for  

  To make me sad  

  No  your Grace. 

To  uh  teach your sister. 

To teach my sister how 

to be a better lover  

You think I bought you to make 

 i Khal Drogo  i  happy  

Oh  you pretty 

little idiot. 

Go on then. 

Get on with it. 

Someday your husband 

will sit there 

and you will sit 

by his side. 

And one day  before too long  

you will present your son to the court. 

All the Lords of Westeros 

will gather here to see 

the little prince   

what if I have a girl  

Gods be good  you ll have boys and girls 

and plenty of them. 

What if I  i only  i  

have girls  

I wouldn t worry 

about that. 

Jeyne Poole s mother had five children   

all of them girls. 

Yes  but it s 

highly unlikely. 

But what if  

Well  if you only 

had girls  

I suppose the throne would 

pass to Prince Joffrey s little brother. 

And everyone 

would hate me. 

Nobody could ever 

hate you. 

  Joffrey does. 

  Nonsense. 

Why would you say 

such a thing  

That business with the wolves  

Sansa  

I ve told you 

a hundred times  

  A direwolf is not   

  please shut up about it. 

Do you remember 

your lessons  

Who built the Iron Throne  

Aegon the Conqueror. 

And who built 

the Red Keep  

Maegor the Cruel. 

And how many years 

did it take to build   

my grandfather and Uncle 

were murdered here  weren t they  

They were killed on the orders of 

King Aerys  yes. 

  The Mad King. 

  Commonly known as the Mad King. 

Why were they killed  

You should be speak to your 

father about these matters. 

I don t want to speak 

to my father   ever. 

Sansa  you will 

find it in your heart 

to forgive your father. 

No  I won t. 

It s The Hand s 

tournament that s causing 

  all this trouble  My Lords. 

  The  i King s  i  tournament. 

I assure you The Hand 

wants no part of it. 

Call it what you will  

Lord Stark  Ser  

the city is packed with people 

and more flooding in every day. 

Last night we had a tavern riot  

a brothel fire  

 i three stabbings and a drunken horse race  i  

 i down the Street of Sisters.  i  

  Dreadful. 

  If you can t keep the King s peace  

perhaps the city watch should be 

commanded by someone who can. 

  I need more men. 

  Ned   i You ll get .  i  

  Lord Baelish will see it paid for. 

  I will  

You found money 

for a champion s purse  

 i you can find money  i  

 i to keep the peace.  i  

I ll also give you 

 of my household guard 

 i till the crowds  i  

 i have left.  i  

Thank you  

My Lord Hand  Ser. 

They will be put 

to good use. 

The sooner this is over  

the better. 

The realm prospers 

from such events  My Lord. 

They give the great 

a chance at glory  

and the lowly a respite 

from their woes. 

 i And every inn in  i  

 i the city is full  i  

and the whores 

are walking bow legged. 

I m sure the tourney 

puts coins in many a pocket. 

  Hmmm. 

  Now... 

If there s nothing else  

My Lords  

Oh  this heat. 

On days like this  

I envy you Northerners 

your summer snows. 

Until tomorrow  My Lord   

I ve been hoping to talk 

to you about Jon Arryn. 

Lord Arryn  

Oh  his death was 

a great sadness 

to all of us. 

I took personal charge 

of his care  

but I could not 

save him. 

His sickness struck him 

very hard and very fast. 

I saw him in my chambers 

just the night 

before he passed. 

Lord Jon often came 

to me for counsel. 

Why  

I have been Grand Maester 

for many years. 

Kings and Hands have come to me 

for advice since   

What did Jon want 

the night before he died  

Oh  he came inquiring 

after a book. 

A book  

What book  

Oh  I fear 

it would be of little interest 

to you  My Lord. 

A ponderous Tome. 

No  I d like to read it. 

 The Lineages and Histories 

of the Great H 

of the Seven Kingdoms  

with descriptions 

of many high lords 

and noble ladies 

and their children.  

 Harkon Umber  

first of his name  

born to Lord Hother Umber 

and Lady Amaryllis Umber 

in the  year 

after Aegon s landing  

at the last hearth. 

Blue of eye  brown of hair 

and fair complected  

died in his  year 

of a wound sustained 

in a bear hunt.  

As I said  My Lord  

a ponderous read. 

Did Jon Arryn tell you 

what he wanted with it  

He did not  My Lord. 

And I did not presume to ask. 

  Jon s death... 

  Such a tragedy. 

...Did he say anything to you 

during his final hours  

Nothing of import  

My Lord. 

Oh   there was one phrase 

he kept repeating  

 The seed is strong   

I think it was. 

   The seed is strong   

  Mm. 

  What does that mean  

  Oh  

the dying mind is 

a demented mind  Lord Stark. 

For all the weight 

they re given  

last words are usually 

as significant 

as first words. 

And you re quite certain 

he died of a natural illness  

What else could it be  

Poison. 

A disturbing thought. 

No no no  I don t 

think it likely. 

The Hand 

was loved by all. 

What sort of man 

would dare   

I ve heard it said that poison 

is a woman s weapon. 

Yes  women  

cravens... 

And eunuchs. 

Did you know that 

Lord Varys is a eunuch  

Everybody knows that. 

Yes yes  of course. 

How that sort of  i person  i  

found himself 

on the King s Council  

I will never know. 

I ve taken enough 

of your time. 

No trouble at all  My Lord. 

It s a great honor   

thank you. 

I ll find my own way out. 

Syrio says a water dancer 

can stand on one toe 

for hours. 

It s a hard fall 

down these steps. 

Syrio says every hurt 

is a lesson 

and every lesson 

makes you better. 

  Tomorrow I m going to be chasing cats. 

  Cats  

Syrio says. 

He says every swordsman 

should study cats. 

They re quiet as shadows 

and as light as feathers. 

You have to be 

quick to catch them. 

He s right about that. 

Now that Bran s awake 

will he come 

live with us  

Well  he needs to get 

his strength back first. 

He wants to be 

a knight of the Kingsguard. 

  He can t be one now  can he  

  No. 

But someday 

he could be 

Lord of a Holdfast 

or sit on 

the King s Council. 

Or he might raise castles 

like Brandon the builder. 

Can I be Lord 

of a Holdfast  

You will marry 

a high lord 

and rule his castle. 

And your sons 

shall be knights 

and princes and lords. 

Hmm  

No. 

That s not me. 

Hello. 

Ser Alliser said I m to be 

your new Watch partner. 

I should warn you  

I don t see 

all that well. 

Come stand by the fire. 

  It s warmer. 

  No  that s all right. I m fine. 

You re not. 

You re freezing. 

I don t like 

high places. 

You can t fight. 

You can t see. 

You re afraid of heights 

and almost everything else probably. 

What are you 

doing here  Sam  

On the morning of my  Nameday  

my father came to me. 

 You re almost 

a man now   he said... 

 But you re not worthy 

of my land and title. 

Tomorrow  you re going 

to take the black  

forsake all claim to your 

inheritance and start North. 

If you do not   

he said... 

 Then we ll have a hunt 

and somewhere in these woods 

your horse will stumble 

and you ll be thrown 

from your saddle to die. 

Or so I ll tell 

your mother. 

Nothing would 

please me more.  

Ser Alliser s going to make me 

fight again tomorrow  isn t he  

Yes  he is. 

I m not going to get 

any better  you know  

Well... 

You can t get any worse. 

I hear you re reading 

a boring book. 

Hmph. 

Pycelle talks too much. 

Oh  he never stops. 

Do you know Ser Hugh 

of the Vale  

Not surprising. 

Until recently  

he was only a squire   

Jon Arryn s squire. 

He was knighted 

almost immediately 

after his master s 

untimely death. 

Knighted for what  

Why are you 

telling me this  

I promised cat 

that I d help you. 

Where is Ser Hugh  

  I ll speak to him. 

  A singularly bad idea. 

Do you see 

that boy there  

One of Varys s little birds. 

The spider has taken a great 

interest in your comings and goings. 

Now look there. 

That one belongs 

to the Queen. 

And do you see that septa 

pretending to read her book  

Varys or the Queen  

No  she s one 

of mine. 

Is there someone in your service 

whom you trust completely  

  Yes. 

  The wiser answer was no  My Lord. 

Get a message to 

this paragon of yours   

discreetly   

send him to question Ser Hugh. 

After that  you might want him 

to visit a certain armorer in the city. 

He lives in a large house at the top 

of the Street of Steel. 

  Why  

  I have my observers  as I said  

and it s possible 

that they saw Lord Arryn 

visit this armorer several times 

in the weeks before his death. 

Lord Baelish  perhaps I was 

wrong to distrust you. 

Distrusting me was 

the wisest thing 

you ve done since you climbed 

off your horse. 

...Two  three  

  five  

six    

  Ser Hugh  

  Ser Hugh  

  As you can see  I m busy. 

I m here on behalf 

of Lord Eddard Stark  

the Hand of the King. 

I m the Captain 

of his guard. 

I m sorry  I didn t catch 

your name  Ser... 

No  Ser.  

I m not a knight. 

I see. Well  it just 

so happens that I am. 

He said he d be glad 

to talk to the hand himself. 

He s a  i knight   i  

you see. 

Ah  a knight. 

They strut around 

like roosters down here. 

 i Even the ones who ve never seen  i  

 i an arrow coming their way.  i  

You shouldn t be 

out here  My Lord. 

  There s no telling who has eyes where. 

  Let them look. 

The former Hand did call on me  

My Lord  several times. 

I regret to say he did not honor me 

with his patronage. 

What did 

Lord Arryn want  

He always came to see the boy. 

I d like to see him 

as well. 

As you Gendry  My lord. 

Here he is. 

Strong for his age. 

He works hard. 

Show the hand 

the helmet you made  lad. 

  This is fine work. 

  It s not for sale. 

Boy  this is 

the King s Hand  

  If his lordship wants the helm   

  I made it for me. 

  Forgive him  My Lord. 

  There s nothing to forgive. 

When Lord Arryn came to visit you  

what would you talk about  

He just asked me questions 

is all  My Lord. 

What kind 

of questions  

About my work at first  

if I was being treated well  

if I liked it here. 

But then he started 

asking me about my mother. 

  Your mother  

  Who she was  what she looked like. 

What did you tell him  

She died when I was little. 

She had yellow hair. 

She d sing to me sometimes. 

Look at me. 

Get back to work  lad. 

If the day ever comes 

when that boy 

would rather wield 

a sword than forge one  

 i you send him to me.  i  

Find anything  

King Robert s 

bastard son. 

 i He likes that.  i  

This is for the King 

from Lord Stark. 

Should I leave it with   

shhh. 

Listen. 

Do you hear them  

How many do you think 

are in there with him  

Huh  

   i Guess.  i  

  Three  

Four. 

He likes to do this 

when I m on duty   

he makes me listen 

as he insults my sister. 

Forgive me  My Lord   

Why do I have to forgive you  

Have you wronged me  

We ve met before  you know. 

Have we  

Strange  I ve forgotten. 

The siege of Pyke. 

We fought side by side one afternoon. 

Ah. 

  That s where you got your scar  

  Aye. 

Oh. 

One of the Greyjoys 

nearly took my eye. 

  Vicious sons of whores. 

  They like their bloodshed. 

 i They stopped liking it  i  

 i at the end.  i  

That was a proper battle. 

Do you remember 

Thoros of Myr charging 

through the breach  

With his burning sword  

I ll remember that 

till the day I die. 

I saw the youngest of the 

Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. 

It was like seeing a shark 

on a mountaintop. 

Theon  

He s a good lad. 

I doubt it. 

 i I ll bet you smell  i  

 i of blackberry jam   i  

 i Let me smell it.  i  

 i Come here.  i  

Can I leave this 

with you  

The message 

from Lord Stark. 

I don t serve Lord Stark. 

  Where have you been  

  Watch duty. 

  With Sam. 

  Ah  prince porkchop. 

  Where is he  

  He wasn t hungry. 

Impossible  

That s enough. 

Sam s no different 

from the rest of us. 

There was no place 

for him in the world  

so he s come here. 

We re not going to hurt him 

in the training yard anymore. 

Never again  

no matter what Thorne says. 

He s our brother now 

and we re going to protect him. 

You  i are  i  in love  Lord Snow. 

You girls can do 

as you please. 

But if Thorne puts me 

up against lady piggy  

I m gonna slice me off 

a side of bacon. 

No one touches Sam. 

What are you 

waiting for  

Attack him  

You get in there. 

Hit me. 

Go on  hit me  

 i I yield   i  

Yield yield. 

 i I yield.  i  

You think this 

is funny  do you  

When you re out there 

beyond The Wall 

with the sun going down  

do you want 

a man at your back  

Or a sniveling boy  

You send this whore 

to give me commands  

I should have sent 

you back her head  

Forgive me  Khaleesi. 

I did as you asked. 

Hush now. 

It s all right. 

  Irri  take her and leave us. 

   i Yes  Khaleesi.  i  

  Why did you hit her   

  How many times do I have to tell you  

You do not command me. 

I wasn t commanding you. 

I just wanted to invite 

you to supper. 

  What s this  

  It s a gift. 

  I had it made for you. 

  Dothraki rags  

  Are you going to dress me now  

  Please. 

This stinks of manure. 

All of it. 

Stop   stop it. 

You would turn me into one 

of them  wouldn t you  

Next you ll want 

to braid my hair. 

You ve no right 

to a braid. 

You ve won 

no victories yet. 

You do not 

talk back to me  

You are a horselord s slut. 

And now you ve woken 

the dragon   

I am a Khaleesi 

of the Dothraki  

I am the wife 

of the great Khal 

and I carry his son 

inside me. 

The next time 

you raise a hand to me 

will be the last time 

you have hands. 

I know for a fact 

that some of the officers 

go to that brothel 

in mole s town. 

I wouldn t doubt it. 

Don t you think it s 

a little bit unfair  

Making us take our vows 

while they sneak off 

for a little 

sally on the side  

  Sally on the side  

  It s silly  isn t it  

What  we can t defend 

the wall unless we re celibate  

It s absurd. 

I didn t think you d be 

so upset about it. 

Why not  

  Because I m fat  

  No. 

But I like girls just 

as much as you do. 

They might not 

like me as much. 

I ve never   

been with one. 

You ve probably 

had hundreds. 

No. 

As a matter of fact  

I m the same as you. 

Yeah. 

I find that hard 

to believe. 

I came very close once. 

I was alone in a room 

with a naked girl  but   

you didn t know 

where to put it  

I know where to put it. 

Was she... 

Old and ugly  

Young and gorgeous. 

A whore named Ros. 

What color hair  

  Red. 

  Oh  I like red hair. 

And her  um... 

Her... 

  You don t want to know. 

  That good  

  Better. 

  Oh no. 

So why exactly 

did you not make love 

to Ros with the perfect    

What s my name  

Jon Snow  

And why is 

my surname snow  

Because... 

You re a bastard 

from the North. 

I never met my mother. 

My father wouldn t even 

tell me her name. 

I don t know if she s 

living or dead. 

I don t know 

if she s a noblewoman 

or a Fisherman s wife... 

Or a whore. 

So I sat there 

in the brothel as Ros 

took off her clothes. 

But I couldn t do it. 

Because all I could 

think was 

what if I got her pregnant 

and she had a child  

another bastard named Snow  

It s not a good life 

for a child. 

Ah  mmm. 

So... 

You didn t know 

where to put it  

 i Enjoying yourselves   i  

You look cold  boys. 

It is a bit nippy. 

A bit nippy  

yeah  by the fire  

indoors. 

It s still summer. 

Do you boys even remember 

the last winter  

How long has it been now  

What   years  

I remember. 

Was it uncomfortable 

at Winterfell  

Were there days when 

you just couldn t get warm  

never mind how many fires 

your servants built  

  I build my own fires. 

  That s admirable. 

I spent six months out there  

beyond The Wall 

 i during the last winter.  i  

It was supposed to be 

a two week mission. 

We heard a rumor Mance Rayder 

was planning to attack Eastwatch. 

So we went out to look 

for some of his men   

capture them  

gather some knowledge. 

The Wildlings who fight 

for Mance Rayder are hard men. 

Harder than you ll ever be. 

They know their country 

better than we do. 

They knew there was 

a storm coming in. 

So they hid in their caves 

and waited for it to pass. 

And we got caught 

in the open. 

Wind so strong 

it yanked  foot trees 

straight from the ground  

 i roots and all.  i  

 i If you took your gloves off  i  

 i to find your cock  i  

 i to have a piss   i  

you lost a finger 

to the frost. 

And all in darkness. 

You don t know cold. 

Neither of you do. 

The horses died first. 

We didn t have enough to feed them  

to keep them warm. 

Eating the horses was easy. 

But later when  i we  i  

started to fall... 

That wasn t easy. 

We should have had a couple of 

boys like you along  shouldn t we  

Soft  fat boys like you. 

We d have lasted 

a fortnight on you 

and still had bones 

leftover for soup. 

Soon we ll have 

new recruits 

and you lot will be passed along 

to the Lord Commander 

for assignment 

and they will call you 

men of The Night s Watch  

but you d be fools 

to believe it. 

 i You re boys still.  i  

 i And come the winter  i  

 i you will die...  i  

Like flies. 

I hit him. 

I hit the dragon. 

Your brother Rhaegar 

was the Last Dragon. 

Viserys is less than 

the shadow of a snake. 

He is still 

the true king. 

The truth now  

Do you want to see your brother 

sitting on the Iron Throne  

No. 

But the common people 

are waiting for him. 

Illyrio said they are sewing dragon 

banners and praying for his return. 

The common people pray for rain  

health and a summer that never ends. 

They don t care what games 

the high lords play. 

What do you pray for  

Ser Jorah  

Home. 

I pray for home too. 

My brother will never take back 

the Seven Kingdoms. 

He couldn t lead an army 

even if my husband gave him one. 

He ll never take us home. 

Lover s quarrel  

I m sorry. 

Do I...  

Sansa dear  this is Lord Baelish. 

He s known   

an old friend 

of the family. 

I ve known your mother 

a long long time. 

  Why do they call you Littlefinger  

  Arya  

  Don t be rude  

  No  it s quite all right. 

When I was a child 

I was very small 

and I come from a little spit of land 

called The Fingers  

so you see  

it s an exceedingly 

clever nickname. 

I ve been sitting here 

for days  

Start the damn joust 

before I piss myself  

Gods  who is that  

 i Ser Gregor Clegane.  i  

 i They call him the Mountain.  i  

 i The hound s older brother.  i  

  And his opponent  

  Littlefinger  Ser Hugh of the Vale. 

 i He was  i  

 i Jon Arryn s squire.  i  

 i Lo how far he s come.  i  

Yes yes  enough 

of the bloody pomp. 

Have at it  

Not what you 

were expecting  

Has anyone ever told you the story 

of the Mountain and the Hound  

Lovely little tale 

of brotherly love. 

The Hound was just a pup  

six years old maybe. 

Gregor a few years older   

already a big lad  already 

getting a bit of a reputation. 

Some lucky boys 

 i just born with a talent  i  

 i for violence.  i  

 i One evening Gregor found  i  

 i his little brother  i  

 i playing with a toy  i  

 i by the fire    i  

 i Gregor s toy   i  

a wooden knight. 

Gregor never said a word  

he just grabbed his brother 

by the scruff of his neck 

 i and shoved his face  i  

 i into the burning coals.  i  

 i Held him there  i  

 i while the boy screamed   i  

 i while his face melted.  i  

There aren t very many people 

who know that story. 

I won t tell anyone. 

I promise. 

No  please don t. 

If the Hound so much as 

heard you mention it  

I m afraid all the knights 

in King s Landing 

would not be able 

to save you. 

My Lord  

her Grace the Queen. 

  Your Grace. 

  You re missing your tournament. 

Putting my name on it 

doesn t make it mine. 

I thought we might put what happened 

on the Kingsroad behind us   

the ugliness 

with the wolves. 

And forcing you to kill 

the beast was extreme. 

Though sometimes we go to extremes 

where our children are concerned. 

How is Sansa  

She likes it here. 

 i She s the only  i  

 i Stark who does.  i  

Favors her mother  

not much 

of the North in her. 

  What are you doing here  

  I might ask the same of you. 

What is it you 

hope to accomplish  

The King called on me 

to serve him and the realm  

and that s what I ll do 

until he tells me otherwise. 

You can t change him. 

You can t help him. 

He ll do what he wants  which is 

all he s ever done. 

You ll try your best 

to pick up the pieces. 

If that s my job  

then so be it. 

You re just a soldier  

aren t you  

You take your orders 

and you carry on. 

I suppose it makes sense. 

Your older brother was trained to 

lead and you were trained to follow. 

I was also trained to kill 

my enemies  your Grace. 

As was I. 

Seven blessings to you  

goodfolk  

And to you. 

Boy  

Bread  meat and beer. Quickly. 

Ah  good idea  grandfather. 

I m starving. 

A song 

while we wait or    

I d rather throw myself 

down a well. 

Now now  grandfather  this may be your 

last chance if you re heading North. 

The only music the Northerners know is 

the howling of wolves  

Gods. 

I m sorry  My Lord. 

We re full up. 

   i Every room.  i  

  Tyrion   i My men can sleep in the stable.  i  

As for myself  I don t 

require a large room. 

Truly  My Lord  

we have nothing. 

Is there nothing I can do... 

...To remedy this  

You can have my room. 

Now there s 

a clever man. 

You can manage food  I trust  

Yoren  dine with me. 

  Aye  My Lord. 

  My Lord of Lannister  

Might I entertain you 

while you eat  

I can sing of your father s victory 

at King s Landing  

Nothing would more likely 

ruin my supper. 

Lady Stark  

 i What an unexpected  i  

 i pleasure.  i  

I was sorry to have 

missed you at Winterfell. 

Lady Stark  

I was still Catelyn Tully 

the last time 

I stayed here. 

You  Ser  

is that the black bat of Harrenhal 

I see embroidered on your coat  

It is  My Lady. 

And is Lady Whent 

a true and honest friend 

to my father  Lord Hoster Tully 

of Riverrun  

She is. 

The red stallion was always 

a welcome sight at Riverrun. 

My father counts 

Jonas Bracken 

amongst his oldest 

and most loyal bannermen. 

Our lord is honored 

by his trust. 

I envy your father 

all his fine friends  

Lady Stark  

but I don t quite see 

the purpose of this. 

I know your sigil as well   

the Twin Towers 

of Frey. 

How fares your lord  Ser  

Lord Walder is well  

My Lady. 

 i He has asked your father  i  

 i for the honor of his presence  i  

on his  Nameday. 

He plans to take another wife. 

This man 

came into my house 

as a guest 

and there conspired 

to murder my son  

a boy of . 

In the name of King Robert 

and the good lords you serve  

I call upon you 

to seize him 

and help me return him 

to Winterfell 

to await the King s Justice. 

Do you really think I ll let you 

sell her like a common whore  

Dorne is the safest 

place for her. 

  You cannot stop it. 

  No  

No  wait. 

It wasn t her. 

You can t avenge him if you re dead. 

On behalf of the warlocks 

of Qarth  I welcome you. 

It would be an honor to host you 

at the House of the Undying  

Mother of Dragons. 

 i Stannis will be here  i  

 i in an hour.  i  

Renly s bannermen 

will flock to him. 

Calling yourself king 

doesn t make you one. 

And if Renly wasn t a king  

I wasn t a queen. 

  Do you want to be a queen  

  I want to be  i the  i  queen. 

There on that mountain. 

We need to get rid 

of those lookouts. 

I need to move fast 

and silent. 

Lord Commander   

I d like to join Lord Qhorin. 

Aye. 

Are you going 

to kill Joffrey  

  If the Gods give me strength. 

  And then what  

First we have to 

win the war. 

You never told me 

where you re from. 

 i Volantis.  i  

You re one of them now. 

I should have let you burn. 

You saved me 

and the two I was with. 

You stole three deaths 

from the Red God. 

  Speak three names. 

  I can name anyone  

   i And you ll kill him   i  

  A man has said. 

 i The one who tortures everyone.  i  

 i They call him the Tickler.  i  

The Stony Shore s not far 

from Torrhen s Square. 

More impressive prize than 

a few fisherman s daughters. 

Soon as Winterfell got word that 

we d taken Torrhen s Square  

the Starks would send 

their men to take it back. 

Take me to my ship. 

Lord Stark  Torrhen s Square 

is under siege. 

Torrhen s Square is barely 

 leagues from here. 

Go  Ser Rodrik. 

Take the men you need. 

 i What did you see  i  

 i in your dream   i  

That the sea came 

to Winterfell. 

 i Drowned men were  i  

 i floating in the yard.  i  

Ser Rodrik 

was one of them. 

I ve taken your castle. 

  Theon  

  It s Prince Theon now. 

Get up. 

You have to get dressed. 

I ve taken Winterfell. 

I took it. 

I m occupying it. 

I sent men over the walls 

with grappling claws and ropes. 

  Why  

  To take the castle. 

  You went with Robb. 

  And he sent me back to Pyke. 

I m a Greyjoy. I can t fight 

for Robb and my father both. 

  Where s Hodor  

  I don t know. 

Find the Halfwit. 

My men are bringing your people 

together in the courtyard. 

Why  

So you and I can 

go down and tell them 

  how you ve yielded Winterfell to me. 

  I won t. 

Yes  you will. 

I won t. 

I ll never yield. 

We ll fight you 

and throw you out. 

The castle is mine  

but these people 

are still yours. 

You ll yield 

to keep them safe  

to keep them alive. 

That s what a good 

lord would do. 

Think carefully about 

what you want to say. 

Theon. 

Did you hate us 

the whole time  

I ve yielded 

Winterfell to Theon. 

Louder. 

Say Prince Theon. 

I ve yielded Winterfell 

to Prince Theon. 

You all know me. 

Aye  we know you for 

a steaming sack of shit. 

Farlen  you be silent. 

Listen to your 

little Lord  Farlen. 

He has more sense 

than you do. 

All of you should do 

as he commands. 

My father has donned the 

ancient crown of salt and rock 

and declared himself 

King of the Iron Islands. 

He claims the North as well 

by right of conquest. 

You are all his subjects. 

Bugger that. 

I serve the Starks. 

If you think you can 

hold the North with this   

Shut up  

 i If you serve me as loyally  i  

 i as you served Ned Stark   i  

 i I  will be as good to you  i  

 i as he ever was.  i  

Betray me  and you will 

wish you hadn t. 

Maester Luwin  

send a raven to Pyke 

informing my father 

of my victory here 

and one to Deepwood Motte 

to my sister. 

Inform her that she s 

to bring  men to Winterfell. 

You are a Maester 

of the Citadel 

sworn to serve the lord 

of Winterfell  are you not  

I am. 

I am the Lord 

of Winterfell 

as Bran just informed you. 

Send the ravens. 

My Lord. 

My Lord Greyjoy. 

I see you ve finally learned 

how to address your betters. 

What do you want  

I was brought here 

a captive. 

You were here the day 

I was taken. 

I m the one who took you. 

What of it  

Let me serve you. 

 i Serve me how   i  

I need fighters  

not kitchen sluts. 

It was Robb Stark who 

put me in the kitchens. 

Put a spear 

in my hand again. 

So you can bury it 

in my neck  

Do you take me 

for a fool  

Get up. 

Step aside. 

Why  

It s your dream  

Little Lord. 

The ocean has come 

to swallow this place. 

I ain t letting it 

drown me. 

  And in a few days  time   

 i Greyjoy   i  

 i What have they  i  

 i done to him   i  

We caught this one on this way 

back from Torrhen s Square. 

Took out two of ours 

before I got his sword. 

Ser Rodrik  it grieves me that 

we meet as foes. 

It grieves me you ve less honor 

than a back alley whore. 

You were raised here 

under this roof. 

  These people are your people. 

  They are not my people. 

King Robb thought of you 

as a brother. 

My brothers are dead. 

They died fighting 

Stark men  men like you. 

Aye  they died fighting 

a war your father started. 

Lord Stark raised you 

among his own sons. 

Among them  

but not one of them. 

I was his hostage 

taken from my home. 

If he were alive 

to see this   

He s not. 

He s dead. 

The Seven Kingdoms 

are at war. 

And Winterfell is mine. 

I should have put 

a sword in your belly 

instead of 

in your hand. 

You ve served this House 

faithfully  old man. 

But keep talking 

and I ll   

Take him to the cells. 

Lock him up   

My prince  

you cannot let that stand. 

He must pay. 

I ll lock him in a cell 

until he rots   

No  he has to pay 

the iron price. 

They ll never respect 

you while he lives. 

Ser Rodrik  

I sentence you to death. 

No  You said no harm 

would come to them if I yielded. 

The old man couldn t 

keep his mouth shut. 

I urge you not to make 

a hasty decision. 

He disrespected me 

in front of my men. 

That was his decision  

not mine. 

He is worth more 

to you alive than dead. 

The Starks will pay. 

Please  Theon  

think what you do. 

You ll address me 

as Prince Theon 

or you ll be next. 

Come. 

No  

  No  

 i   Theon   i  

Please  

Ser Rodrik  

He who passes the sentence 

should swing the sword. 

 i   I m begging you   i  

  Coward. 

Stop  Stop right now  

You don t give commands anymore  

Little Lord. 

  Please  stop this. Please stop him. 

 i   Hush now  child.  i  

I m off to see your father. 

You said no harm 

would come  

 i You said no harm would come.  i  

 i Theon  please.  i  

Any last words  old man  

Gods help you  

Theon Greyjoy. 

Now you are truly lost. 

 i Theon  please  don t.  i  

 i   Do something.  i  

 i   I ll do anything. Please   i  

 i No  please  stop it   i  

Ghost  stay with us. 

Ghost  

There goes your pet. 

 i He s not a pet.  i  

 i You re right   i  

 i he s not.  i  

You can t tame 

a wild thing. 

You can t trust 

a wild thing. 

  Ghost is different. 

  So you think. 

Wild creatures 

have their own rules  

their own reasons. 

And you ll never 

know them. 

Now the wildlings 

we re looking for 

sleep during the day 

and hunt at night. 

I thought you said 

you couldn t know wild things. 

I said you can t. 

They find a nice cave 

to hide in while the sun s up 

and do their killing 

when it s dark. 

  We could do the same. 

  No  we couldn t. 

This is their country. 

They know where to walk  

where not to walk. 

I ve lost good men 

who fell into a crevasse 

they didn t see 

till they were in it. 

My father always said 

I m of the North. 

  I wasn t joking. 

  Look around  boy. 

This look like 

home to you  

You start thinking 

you know this place  it ll kill you. 

You understand me  

No  you don t. 

We re at war. 

We ve always been at war. 

It s never going to end  cause 

we re not fighting an enemy. 

We re fighting the North 

and it s not going anywhere. 

The Watch has given 

you a great gift. 

You only have one thing 

to give in return   

your life. 

I ll gladly give my life. 

I don t want you 

to be glad about it. 

I want you to curse 

and fight 

until your heart s 

done pumping. 

And know this  boy   

your death will be a gift 

for them south of the Wall. 

They ll never know 

what you ve done. 

They ll never know 

how you died. 

They won t even 

know your damn name  

but they ll be alive because 

some nameless bastard 

north of the Wall 

gave his life for theirs. 

Now  do you understand me  

I do. 

You re even dumber 

than you look. 

It s just words  boy  

to keep us a little 

warmer in the night  

make us feel like 

we ve got a purpose. 

Come on. 

We ve got to find these 

goat fuckers before night falls 

and they find us. 

  Can you read  

  My Lord  

Can you read  

This letter detailing 

our infantry movements 

was meant for Lord Damon 

of House Marbrand. 

It was sent to Lord Marlyn 

of House Dormand. 

My apologies  My Lord. 

I must have   

Girl  fetch me the  History of the  

Greater and the Lesser Houses.  

It s the one on the   

My cupbearer can read 

better than you. 

To whom does House Dormand 

owe allegiance  

My Lord  I   

To the Starks 

of Winterfell  

Who have   men 

and my son  

I judged you might be 

good for something more 

than brutalizing peasants. 

I see I overestimated you. 

 i If you ever put my son s  i  

 i life at risk again  I ll...  i  

Leave us. 

Put the book away  girl. 

Maybe you should devise our next 

battle plan while you re about it. 

  Lord Petyr Baelish. 

  Hmmm. 

Give us the room. 

Clear all this. 

  Lord Tywin. 

  Baelish. 

  Wine  

  Thank you. 

What news 

from the capital  

I travelled here directly 

from Renly Baratheon s camp. 

Ah  the late king Renly. 

Rather a short reign. 

Murdered by a woman  

I hear. 

So they say. 

There has been talk 

of other forces at work  

dark forces. 

Here. 

Men love to blame demons 

when their grand plans 

unravel. 

It is my belief 

that a moment of chaos 

affords opportunities 

lost soon after. 

You say that as if you were 

the first man alive to think it. 

Yes  a crisis 

is an opportunity. 

What other brilliant insights 

have you brought me today  

After the Lannisters 

and the Starks  

the Tyrells command 

the largest host. 

Their lands are the most 

fertile in the Seven Kingdoms  

  feeding horses and soldiers. 

  Yes  yes  yes. 

The Tyrells have not yet declared 

for any of the surviving kings. 

Loras wants revenge. He blames 

Stannis for Renly s death. 

And Margaery   

Wants to be queen. 

Yes  she does. 

House Tyrell rebelled 

against the Iron Throne  

  against my grandson. 

  They did. 

And perhaps that treason 

should be punished 

 i one day   i  

after Stannis and Robb Stark 

are defeated. 

More wine for Lord Baelish. 

If you will allow me to represent 

your family s interests  

I believe that an advantageous 

agreement   

The Tyrell host has 

returned to Highgarden  

They have. 

Pardon  My Lord. 

It s only wine. 

You would ride 

there yourself  

Tonight  with your leave. 

I ll have an answer 

by nightfall. 

That ll be all  girl. 

What else  

On your son 

Tyrion s directive  

I met with Catelyn Stark. 

Why  

 i He had an interesting  i  

 i proposal for her  i  

  concerning her daughters. 

  Hmm. 

  A girl. 

  A wildling. 

We could question her. 

You could. 

She won t answer. 

I ve known a wildling to bite off 

his tongue instead of talking. 

  What s your name  

  Ygritte. 

She was reaching for this axe 

when you got to her. 

Give her half a chance  

she ll bury it in your face. 

I gave you my name. 

I m Jon Snow. 

You ought to burn 

them you killed. 

 i We d need a big  i  

 i fire for that.  i  

Tell me  Ygritte  

why do you want us 

to build a big fire  

Are there some more 

friends in the area  

Burn them or maybe you ll 

need those swords again. 

Our boy here s already 

killed one dead man. 

He can do it again 

if he has to. 

What waits 

beyond the pass  

  The Free Folk. 

  How many  

Hundreds and thousands. 

More than you ve 

ever seen  Crow. 

Why come to the mountains  

What s in the frostfangs 

your king could want  

Do you mean to march 

on the Wall  

Do you know 

who I am  girl  

Qhorin Halfhand. 

Tell me true. 

If your people captured me  

would they take me prisoner  

They d take your head 

off your shoulders 

if they was feeling kind. 

If not  

they d kill you slow. 

We have no food for her. 

Can t spare a man 

to watch her. 

Can t let her go. She ll bring 

Mance Rayder s army down on us. 

It needs to be done. 

  Want me to do it  

  No. 

No  I ll do it. 

Come  brothers. 

We ll leave him to it. 

We ll meet you 

at the top. 

Don t take too long. 

We re deep in 

their country now. 

You never killed 

a woman before  did you  

You don t need 

to do it. 

Mance would take you. 

I know he would. 

There s secret ways. 

The Crows would 

never catch us. 

I m as much a Crow 

as they are. 

Will you burn me... 

after  

Can t. 

Someone might 

see the smoke. 

Strike hard and true  

Jon Snow  

or I ll come back 

and haunt you. 

That s cold. 

Go on. 

Be quick about it. 

Do it. 

Bastard  do it  

You can t do it. 

We both know it. 

The sun s going 

down  Jon Snow. 

And your friends 

are nowhere close. 

I ll find them. 

Call for the 

go on. 

Call loudly. 

 i May the Seven guide  i  

 i the princess on her journey.  i  

 i May the mother  i  

 i give her health.  i  

May the crone 

give her wisdom. 

May the warrior 

give her courage. 

One day I pray 

you love someone. 

I pray you love 

her so much  

 i when you close your eyes   i  

 i you see her face.  i  

I want that for you. 

I want you to know what 

it s like to love someone  

to truly love someone  

before I take her 

from you. 

You sound like a little cat mewling 

for his mother. 

Princes don t cry. 

  I saw you cry. 

  Did you say something  My Lady  

My little brother cried 

when I left Winterfell. 

So  

It seems a normal thing. 

Is your little brother 

a prince  

No. 

Not really relevant  

then  is it  

Come  dog. 

 i Hail  Joffrey   i  

 i Hail to the king.  i  

Seven blessings on you  

Your Grace. 

 i Murderer  Bastard   i  

All hail the king. 

 i He s no king.  i  

 i He s a bastard   i  

Please  Your Grace  

we re hungry. 

 i   Freak   i  

  Get the prince back to the keep now. 

Yes  My Lord. 

Come  quickly. 

 i Please  Your Grace   i  

 i give us some food   i  

 i Bread  Your Grace   i  

 i please   i  

Who threw that  

 i I want the man  i  

 i who threw that.  i  

Find who did that 

and bring him to me  

  Hold on  

   i Hold them back   i  

 i Just kill them   i  

 i Kill them all   i  

  Move. Move  

 i   Pull back   i  

 i Tear him to pieces   i  

What are you doing  

I want these people executed  

And they want 

the same for you. 

Where s Sansa  

 i Through the door   i  

 i Come on   i  

Protect the king  

  Get back  

  Fall back  

  Move  

  To the gates  

  Come in  Come in  

  Keep him safe  

Motherfucker  

  Watch out. Hold them back. 

  Come on. 

Hey  

Traitors  

I ll have 

all their heads. 

Oh  you blind  

bloody fool. 

You can t insult me. 

We ve had vicious kings 

and we ve had idiot kings  

but I don t know if  

we ve ever been cursed with 

a vicious idiot for a king. 

  You can t   

  I can  I am. 

They attacked me  

They threw a cow pie at you  

so you decided to kill them all  

They re starving  

you fool. 

All because of a war 

you started. 

You re talking to a king  

And now I ve struck a king. 

Did my hand fall 

from my wrist  

Where is the Stark girl  

Let them have her. 

If she dies  you ll never 

get your Uncle Jaime back. 

You owe him quite a bit  

you know. 

Where are you going  

You ever been fucked  little girl  

Come here. 

Take some men and go and find 

the Stark girl. 

I take my orders 

from the king. 

 i This way   i  

Please  

No  no. 

Please  

You re all right now  

little bird. 

You re all right. 

 i   We ll get you. We ll get you.  i  

 i   This way.  i  

Are you hurt  

My Lady  

The little bird s 

bleeding. 

Someone take her back 

to her cage  

 i see to that cut.  i  

Well done  Clegane. 

I didn t do it for you. 

He shouldn t 

make me wait. 

The Spice King is the second 

wealthiest man in Qarth. 

He makes everyone wait. 

Of course  you could have 

avoided this embarrassment 

if you married 

the wealthiest man in Qarth. 

I already have a husband. 

Khal Drogo is gone  

Khaleesi. 

You are far too young 

to be a widow forever 

and far too beautiful. 

And you are far too smart 

to think that I will 

succumb to flattery. 

I have travelled 

very far in my life 

and met many women  

but none that are 

immune to flattery. 

   i The Mother of Dragons   i  

  Ah. 

Here he comes. 

Forgive me. I had terrible 

dreams last night. 

Terrible dreams. 

I could not sleep 

until the sun was shining 

and the birds were singing. 

 i Look what a beauty you are  i  

 i now the Red Waste  i  

 i has been washed off you.  i  

I am sorry about 

all that unpleasantness. 

The silver hair 

of a true Targaryen. 

Xaro Xhoan Daxos  

she is far too lovely 

for a glorified 

dockworker like yourself. 

Very true  and yet they say 

that your grandfather  

who sold pepper 

off the back of a wagon  

married a lady far lovelier 

and higher born than himself. 

Every lady alive 

was lovelier 

and higher born 

than my grandfather. 

 i Ahem.  i  

Did my servants not offer you 

something to eat  to drink  

I ll have them flogged 

in the square. 

Thank you  My Lord. 

You are a gracious host  

but there is no servant alive 

that can bring me what I want. 

Oh  she has a talent 

for drama  this one. 

So  my little princess  

what is it you want  

My birthright   

the Seven Kingdoms 

of Westeros. 

I fear I m no better than 

a servant in this regard. 

I cannot give you 

what I do not have. 

I m not asking you 

for the Kingdoms. 

I m asking you 

for ships. 

I need to cross 

the Narrow Sea. 

I need my ships as well. 

I use them  you see  

to bring spices from 

one port to another. 

Whatever you grant me 

now will be repaid 

three times over when 

I retake the Iron Throne. 

Retake  

Did you once sit 

on the Iron Throne  

My father sat there 

before he was murdered. 

But if you did not 

sit on it yourself  

would it not be correct 

to say take the Iron Throne  

I didn t come here 

to argue grammar. 

Of course not. 

You came to take my ships. 

So let me explain 

my position  

little princess. 

Unlike you  I do not 

have exalted ancestors. 

I make my living by trade. 

And I judge every trade 

on its merits. 

You ask for ships. 

You say I shall be 

repaid triple. 

I do not doubt your honesty 

or your intentions. 

But before you 

repay your debts  

you must seize 

the Seven Kingdoms. 

  Do you have an army  

  Not yet. 

You do not have an army. 

Do you have powerful 

allies in Westeros  

There are many there 

that support my claim. 

When were you 

there last  

I left when 

I was a baby. 

So  in truth  

you have no allies. 

The people will rise 

to fight for their rightful 

Queen when I return. 

Ah. 

Forgive me  

little princess  

but I cannot make an investment 

based on wishes and dreams. 

Now if you ll pardon me. 

Do you know Illyrio Mopatis  

Magister of Pentos  

Yes  we ve met. 

A shrewd man. 

For my wedding he gave me 

three petrified dragon eggs. 

 i He believed    i  

 i the world believed    i  

that the ages 

had turned them to stone. 

How many centuries has it been 

since dragons roamed the skies  

But I dreamt that 

if I carried those eggs 

into a great fire  

they would hatch. 

When I stepped into the fire  

my own people thought I was mad. 

But when the fire 

burned out  

I was unhurt  

the Mother of Dragons. 

Do you understand  

I m no ordinary woman. 

My dreams come true. 

I admire your passion. 

But in business  I trust 

in logic  not passion. 

I m sorry  little princess. 

I am not 

your little princess. 

I am Daenerys Stormborn 

of the blood of old Valyria 

and I will take 

what is mine. 

With fire and blood  

I will take it. 

Yes  My Lady  

but not with my ships. 

Who taught you to read  

My father  My Lord. 

Hmm. 

I taught my son 

Jaime to read. 

The Maester came 

to me one day  

told me he wasn t learning. 

He couldn t make sense 

of the letters. 

He reversed them 

in his head. 

The Maester said he d heard 

tell of this affliction 

and that we simply 

must accept it. 

Ha  

After that  

I sat Jaime down 

for four hours every day 

until he learned. 

He hated me for it  

for a time. 

For a long time  

but he learned. 

Where is your father  

Is he alive  

Who was he  

A stonemason. 

A stonemason 

who could read  

  Hmm. 

  He taught himself. 

Quite a man. 

What killed him  

Loyalty. 

You re a sharp 

little thing  aren t you  

Did... 

Forgive me  My Lord. 

I shouldn t ask questions. 

No... 

But you ve already begun. 

Did you know 

your father  My Lord  

I did. 

I grew up with him. 

I watched him 

grow old. 

 i He loved us.  i  

He was a good man  

but a weak man  

a weak man who nearly destroyed 

our House and name. 

I m cold. 

I ll fetch more wood 

for the fire  My Lord. 

Mmm. 

Where are you going  girl  

The armory  

My Lord. 

Why  

Lord Tywin sent me. 

What might this be  

Lord Tywin gave it to me. 

What for  

To take to the armory. 

Why would he do that  

Let s go and ask him. 

Move  

Get out of the way  

Amory Lorch. 

A girl has named 

a second name. 

A man will do 

what must be done. 

Now  

A girl cannot tell a man when 

exactly he must do a thing. 

A man cannot make a thing 

happen before its time. 

But he s going to tell Tywin. 

He s getting away. 

It has to be now. 

Guard  

  Your Grace. 

  Your Grace. 

My honor  Your Grace. 

Your Grace. 

  Your Grace. 

  Quent. 

Lady Talisa. 

Your Grace. 

I m not sure I m a lady. 

Westerosi customs are still 

a bit foreign to me. 

It s hard to keep 

all the rules straight. 

But if I remember 

my lessons  

a woman of noble birth 

is always called a lady 

unless she s a queen 

or a princess. 

I could find 

someone who knows. 

Why are you so sure 

I m of noble birth  

Because it s obvious. 

What if I told you my father 

sold lace on the long bridge 

and my mother  my brother  and I lived 

with him above our shop  

I d call you a liar. 

Not very noble to accuse 

a lady of dishonesty. 

I always thought 

I was a brilliant liar. 

Better at amputations  

I m afraid. 

Quite a pretty spot. 

Will we be here long  

I couldn t really discuss 

troop movements with you. 

I m not a spy. 

Of course a spy 

would deny being a spy. 

You re right. 

You ve found me out. 

I m writing a letter 

to the Lannisters. 

 The young wolf 

is on the move.  

Perhaps you d join me... 

If you ve got time  

of course  for  well... 

Robb. 

Mother. 

Mother  this is 

Lady Talisa. 

She s been helping 

with the wounded. 

She s been very... 

helpful. 

Lady Talisa. 

Lady Stark. 

Lady Talisa...  

  Maegyr. 

  Maegyr  

Forgive me  

I do not know this name. 

An uncommon name here. 

An old name in Volantis. 

Excuse me  My Lady. 

Your Grace. 

I ve missed you. 

Yes  you look 

positively forlorn. 

You surprised me  

that s all. 

I didn t think 

I d see you today. 

I wish that you were free 

to follow your heart. 

I know. 

You have inherited your 

father s responsibilities. 

I m afraid they come 

at a cost. 

  I know. 

  You are promised to another   

a debt that must be paid. 

  I haven t forgotten. 

  Your Grace. 

My Lady. 

News from Winterfell. 

Your brothers desert you  

I can tell you 

which way to go. 

We ll stop here. 

Too dark to go 

any farther today. 

Here  There s no 

shelter here. 

There s no shelter 

anywhere. 

There is if you know 

where to look. 

The cold 

could kill us both. 

  If you light a fire   

  No fire. 

  But a fire is   

  No fire. 

Have it your way. 

We ll stay warmer 

if we stay close. 

Bet you freeze to death 

before I do. 

Bet your life. 

Think they re out 

looking for you  

  Yes. 

  Think they ll find you  

Yes. 

You re brave. 

Stupid  

but brave. 

We start again at first light. 

Get some sleep. 

Stop moving. 

I m just trying 

to get comfortable. 

Stop it  

   i You re still moving.  i  

  Was I  

I didn t notice 

that time. 

This cannot be true. 

 i We ve had ravens  i  

 i from White Harbor   i  

Barrowton 

and the Dreadfort. 

I m afraid it is true. 

Why  

Why would Theon   

Because the Greyjoys 

are treasonous whores. 

   i My brothers   i  

  We ve heard nothing of them. 

But Rodrik Cassel is dead. 

I told you  

never trust a Greyjoy  

I must go North at once. 

There s still a war 

to win  Your Grace. 

How can I call myself king 

if I can t hold my own castle  

How can I ask men 

to follow me if I can t   

You are a king. 

And that means you don t have 

to do everything yourself. 

Let me go 

and talk to Theon. 

There will be no talk. 

He will die for this. 

Theon holds the castle 

with a skeleton crew. 

Let me send word to 

my bastard at the Dreadfort. 

He can raise a few hundred men and 

retake Winterfell before the new moon. 

We have the Lannisters 

on the run. 

If you march all the way back north 

now  you ll lose what you gained. 

My boy would be honored to 

bring you Prince Theon s head. 

Tell your son Bran and Rickon s 

safety is paramount. 

And Theon   I want him 

brought to me alive. 

I want to look him 

in the eye and ask him why. 

And then I ll take 

his head myself. 

Why on earth would I trust the word 

of a lying little savage like you  

I m no liar. 

All wildlings 

are liars and savages 

with no loyalty 

to anything or anyone. 

I done what I had 

to do to stay alive. 

I hate the Starks 

as well as you do. 

Let me serve you  

My Lord. 

How  And don t tell me 

to put a spear in your hand. 

There are other ways 

to serve  My Lord. 

I m a prince now  

and you d do well   

There are other ways 

to serve  my prince. 

Like what  

We know things  

the Free people. 

You know things  

Like what  

How to eat dirt  

Other things. 

Savage things. 

Wait outside. 

I always wondered 

what you had under there. 

It comes at a price. 

I m not killing you. 

That s your price. 

I already had that. 

What do you want  then  

other than 

your miserable life  

What all free people want   

my freedom. 

Well  you shall 

have it  then. 

But only if you 

serve me well. 

  Ow. 

  Shh. 

  It s not deep. 

  I thought they were going to kill me. 

They thought so  too. 

He hated me  

the man who hit me. 

I saw it in his eyes. 

Hated me. 

He never met me before  

but he wanted 

to hurt me. 

  Of course he did. 

  Why  Why would a stranger   

you are everything 

he will never have. 

Your horse eats better 

than his children. 

It doesn t matter now. 

He s dead. 

I would have given them 

bread if I had it. 

I hate the King 

more than any of them. 

Don t say these things. 

If the wrong 

people hear you   

But you re not 

the wrong people. 

Don t trust anybody. 

Life is safer 

that way. 

And where 

are you going  

I have something for you 

from Prince Theon. 

  What  

  Me. 

He says I m to make 

the rounds. 

And keep you warm. 

The Spice King refuses me 

because I m a bad investment. 

The Silk King won t support me 

because of his business with 

the Lannisters. 

Why offend 

his best customer  

And the Copper King 

offers me a single ship 

on the condition that I lie 

with him for a night. 

Does he think I will 

whore myself for a boat  

When I came to this city  

I had nothing. 

Truly nothing. 

I slept by the docks. 

And when I could find work 

loading the ships  I would eat. 

If not  

I dreamed of food. 

Today I am the richest 

man in Qarth. 

Do you think the path 

from poverty to wealth 

is always pure 

and honorable  

I have done 

many things  Khaleesi  

that a righteous man 

would condemn. 

And here I am  

with no regrets. 

Bar the gates. 

Ring the bells. 

Slowly  Khaleesi. 

 i Where are they   i  

Where are my dragons   

 i Our father has 

instructed us to tell you  i  

that his alliance 

with the North can continue 

if his terms are met. 

 i Lord Frey requires Lord Edmure  i  

 i to wed one of his daughters.  i  

It s hard to say 

which of the four of us 

is getting the worst 

of this arrangement. 

 i Probably Sansa.  i  

 i Though Loras will 

certainly come to know  i  

a deep and singular misery. 

 i Who s going to tell her   i  

Good afternoon  Lord Tyrion. 

I was just trying on a gown 

for King Joffrey s wedding. 

Yes  it should be 

quite a wedding. 

 i I will allow you 

to go to King s Landing  i  

as restitution for the 

mistakes my soldiers made. 

 i And you will swear  i  

 i to tell your father  i  

 i that I had nothing to do  i  

 i with your maiming.  i  

  My lady. 

  She won t be going with you. 

Let s play a game. 

Which body part 

do you need the least  

  How many times has 

the Lord brought him back    Six. 

He sent you to us for a reason. 

You have someone He needs. 

You told me 

I could be one of you. 

 i You told me  i  

 i this was a brotherhood.  i  

You will make kings 

rise and fall. 

The visions take their toll. 

He s having one now  

  I saw Jon Snow. 

  At Castle Black  

He was on the wrong side 

of the Wall  

surrounded by enemies. 

How far are we  

About a week  I think. 

You think  

You don t know  

When we went to Castle 

Black  we took the kingsroad. 

You and your roads. 

Is that how you lot 

do your fighting  

You march down the road banging 

drums and waving banners  

Most of the time  yes. 

How do the men holding 

the banners fight  

They don t  really. 

It s a great honor 

to carry your house sigil. 

And the drummers   is 

that a great honor  too  

Usually it s the young boys 

banging the drums. 

So what good are they  

  They help the men march. 

  How  

Well  it s   

it s the rhythm. 

Oh  you mean right foot  

left foot  

right foot  

left foot  right foot  

You need help remembering that  

When Mance gives the signal 

and we hit Castle Black  

we won t be banging on drums 

to let them know we re coming. 

No. 

No  you re just gonna 

light the biggest fire 

the North has ever seen to 

let them know you re coming. 

You know nothing  Jon Snow. 

She s right  you don t. 

I know you cut me 

loose on the Wall. 

Cut her loose  too. 

Do you see her 

sulking about it  

That s because she understands 

the way things are. 

And are you gonna 

share it with me  

The deep wisdom you found 

inside the head of a bird  

People work together 

when it suits them. 

They re loyal 

when it suits them. 

They love each other 

when it suits them. 

And they kill each other 

when it suits them. 

She knows that  you don t. 

Which is why you ll 

never hold onto her. 

That rain will cost us 

another day. 

Frey will wait. 

He knows we re coming. 

Lord Walder is prickly 

by nature. 

Prickly  

That what you call it  

Might be the least 

pleasant man I ve ever met. 

  Yes  and that is why   

  I ve seen wet shits 

 i I liked better  i  

 i than Walder Frey.  i  

Apologies  Your Grace. 

Spent too many years around 

lancers and pikemen. 

I ve spent the last two 

years nursing wounded men  

watching them bleed and die. 

I m not afraid of wet shits. 

Lord Frey will take 

this delay as a slight. 

He can take it as he likes. 

He s getting 

the wedding he wanted. 

He s getting a wedding. 

It was a king he wanted. 

 i Edmure is the best 

match a Frey has had  i  

in the history of their house. 

We should all get some sleep. 

If you don t put 

some clothes on  

I can t promise 

I won t attack you again. 

Attack. Attack. 

 i Who are you writing   i  

My mother. 

  Is that Valyrian  

  Gaaa. 

Gaaa  

Say hello for me. 

 i Rytsas.  i  

 i  Ritsas.   i  

That was close enough. 

Does she know 

her daughter s a queen  

Not yet. 

That will be 

a surprise  I expect. 

Many surprises for her. 

How am I supposed 

to sit here planning a war 

when you re over there 

looking like that  

Will you come with me 

one day to Volantis  

 i When all this is over   i  

I will. 

I promise. 

 i I know she d love to meet you.  i  

And her grandchild. 

What  now  

Are you certain  

Are you angry with me  

Angry  

You re my queen. 

And I have your little prince 

or princess inside me. 

Maybe one of each. 

Don t get greedy. 

Can you leave the war 

for one night  

I love you. 

Do you hear me  

I love you. 

Most men fuck like dogs. 

No grace  no skill. 

A few dozen thrusts and done. 

You need to be patient. 

Give her time. 

Your cock shouldn t go near her 

till she s slick 

as a baby seal. 

And then you go inside  

 i but slowly.  i  

Don t jam it in like 

you re spearing a pig. 

Come on  

Hey  come on. 

You think he 

loves you  is that it  

What did he tell you  He s 

gonna make you his lady 

and live with you 

in some castle  

No  he didn t tell me anything. 

He barely talks. 

I ve seen you two 

whispering in the night  

giggling like a pair of girls. 

What  you re jealous  

Of course I m jealous. 

You should be 

with one of your own. 

And you re one of my own  

I ve never heard 

a kind word from your mouth. 

You would if you were mine. 

I d tell you 

that you re beautiful 

and fierce and wild. 

I d be good to you. 

You love him  

 Cause he s pretty  

Is that it  

You like his pretty hair 

and his pretty eyes  

  You think pretty is gonna make you happy  

  Don t touch me. 

You won t love him so much when 

you find out what he really is. 

Growing up at Winterfell  all 

I ever wanted was to escape  

to come here to the capital. 

See the southern knights 

and their painted armor 

and King s Landing 

after dark   

all the candles burning 

in all those windows. 

I m stupid. 

A stupid little girl 

with stupid dreams 

who never learns. 

Come on. 

Come walk with me. 

I remember the first time 

I saw you in the throne room. 

I d never seen anyone 

who looked so unhappy. 

I want very much for you 

to be happy  Sansa  

and so does my grandmother. 

You would have been 

happy at Highgarden. 

But women in our position 

must make the best 

of our circumstances. 

How do I make the best 

of my circumstances  

I have to marry him. 

  Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you  

  No. 

Has he been kind to you  

He s tried. 

You don t want him  though. 

He s a Lannister. 

Far from the worst 

Lannister  wouldn t you say  

I m sorry. 

Here I am complaining to you... 

My son will be king. 

Sons learn from their mothers. 

I plan to teach mine 

a great deal. 

And your son  

if I m not mistaken  

your son might be 

the Lord of Casterly Rock 

and the North someday. 

What  

My son... 

with him. 

I ll have to   

we ll have to   

If it s the pain 

you re worried about   

I m not afraid of the pain. 

Not after what 

Joffrey s done to me. 

What is it  then  

He s rather good looking 

even with the scar. 

Especially with the scar. 

He s a dwarf. 

And Loras   

Loras. 

Some women like tall men. 

Some like short men. 

Some like hairy men. 

Some like bald men. 

Gentle men  rough men  

ugly men  pretty men  

pretty girls. 

Most women don t know what they 

like until they ve tried it. 

And  sadly  so many of us 

get to try so little 

before we re old and gray. 

Tyrion may surprise you. 

From what I ve heard  

he s quite experienced. 

And that s a good thing  

 i It can be.  i  

We re very complicated  

you know. 

Pleasing us takes practice. 

How do you know all this  

Did your mother teach you  

Yes  sweet girl. 

My mother taught me. 

 i She s a child.  i  

 i She s a foot 

taller than you.  i  

A tall child. 

What s the youngest 

you ve ever had  

Not that young. 

How much older  

Older. 

You re a lord  she s a lady. 

And a beauty at that. 

I don t see the problem. 

Shae isn t going to like it. 

Shae is a whore. 

Are you gonna 

marry her  Eh  

How did marrying a whore work 

out for you the first time  

I should never have 

told you about that. 

You want Shae  keep her. 

Wed one and bed the other. 

All you have to do is get 

a son in the Stark girl. 

He ll be Lord 

of Winterfell one day. 

You can rule the North 

in his name. 

You ll have two women and a 

whole kingdom of your own. 

Two women to despise me 

and a whole kingdom 

to join them. 

You waste time trying 

to get people to love you  

you ll end up the most 

popular dead man in town. 

You want to fuck 

that Stark girl. 

 i You just don t want  i  

 i to admit it.  i  

I don t pay you to put 

evil notions in my head. 

The ones already there 

don t need company. 

You pay me to kill people 

who bother you. 

Evil notions come free. 

Your Grace. 

Grandfather. 

You wanted to speak to me  

Yes. 

I d like a report on the 

meetings of my small council. 

You re welcome 

to attend the meetings 

of your small council  

Your Grace. 

Any or all of them. 

I ve been very busy. 

Many important matters 

require a king s attention. 

Of course. 

You ve been holding 

the council meetings 

in the Tower of the Hand instead 

of the small council chamber. 

I have  yes. 

May I ask why  

The Tower of the Hand 

is where I work. 

To walk from there 

to here would take time  

time I could otherwise 

spend productively. 

So if I wanted to attend 

a council meeting  

I would now have to climb all the 

stairs in the Tower of the Hand  

We could arrange 

to have you carried. 

Tell me about 

the Targaryen girl 

in the east and her dragons. 

Where did you hear about this  

Is it true  

Apparently so. 

Don t you think we ought 

to do something about it  

When I was Hand of the King 

under your father s 

predecessor  

the skulls of all 

the Targaryen dragons 

were kept in this room. 

The skull of the last of them 

was right here. 

It was the size of an apple. 

And the biggest 

was the size of a carriage. 

Yes  and the creature 

to whom it belonged 

died  years ago. 

Curiosities on the far 

side of the world 

are no threat to us. 

But how do we know these 

dragons are just curiosities 

and not the beasts that brought 

the whole world to heel  

Because we have been told 

as much by the many experts 

who serve the realm 

by counseling the king 

on matters about 

which he knows nothing. 

But I haven t been counseled. 

You are being counseled 

at this very moment. 

I should be consulted 

about such things. 

From now on  I will see to it 

that you are 

appropriately consulted 

on important matters 

whenever necessary. 

Your Grace. 

Yunkai. 

The Yellow City. 

 i The Yunkish train 

bed slaves  not soldiers.  i  

We can defeat them. 

On the field  with ease. 

But they won t 

meet us on the field. 

They have provisions  

patience  and strong walls. 

 i If they re wise  they ll 

hide behind those walls  i  

and chip away at us  

man by man. 

I don t want half my army killed 

before I ve crossed the Narrow Sea. 

We don t need Yunkai  khaleesi. 

Taking this city will not bring 

you any closer to Westeros 

or the Iron Throne. 

How many slaves 

are there in Yunkai  

   if not more. 

Then we have   

reasons to take the city. 

Now comes the noble 

Razdal mo Eraz 

of that ancient 

and honorable house  

 i master of men  i  

 i and speaker to savages   i  

 i to offer terms of peace.  i  

Noble lord  you are 

in the presence 

of Daenerys Stormborn 

of House Targaryen  

Queen of the Andals 

and the First Men  

 i Khaleesi  i  

 i of the Great Grass Sea   i  

 i Breaker of Chains   i  

 i and Mother of Dragons.  i  

You may approach. 

Sit. 

Will the noble lord 

take refreshment  

Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. 

Our empire was old 

before dragons stirred 

in old Valyria. 

 i Many an army has broken  i  

 i against our walls.  i  

You shall find no easy 

conquest here  khaleesi. 

Good. 

My Unsullied need practice. 

I was told to blood them early. 

If blood is your desire  

blood shall flow. 

But why  

 Tis true you have committed 

savageries in Astapor. 

But the Yunkai are a forgiving 

and generous people. 

The wise masters of Yunkai 

have sent a gift 

for the silver queen. 

There is far more than this awaiting 

you on the deck of your ship. 

  My ship  

  Yes  khaleesi. 

As I said  

we are a generous people. 

 i You shall have as many 

ships as you require.  i  

And what do you ask in return  

All we ask is that 

you make use of these ships. 

Sail them back to Westeros 

where you belong 

and leave us to conduct 

our affairs in peace. 

I have a gift for you as well. 

  Your life. 

  My life  

And the lives 

of your wise masters. 

But I also want 

something in return. 

You will release 

every slave in Yunkai. 

Every man  woman  and child 

shall be given as much food  

clothing  and property 

as they can carry 

as payment for their 

years of servitude. 

Reject this gift  

and I shall show you no mercy. 

You are mad. 

 i We are not Astapor or Qarth.  i  

We are Yunkai and we have 

powerful friends. 

Friends who would take great 

pleasure in destroying you. 

Those who survive  

we shall enslave once more. 

Perhaps we ll make 

a slave of you as well. 

You swore me safe conduct. 

I did  but my dragons 

made no promises. 

And you threatened 

their mother. 

Take the gold. 

My gold. You gave 

it to me  remember  

And I shall put it to good use. 

You d be wise to do the 

same with my gift to you. 

Now get out. 

The Yunkish are a proud people. 

They will not bend. 

And what happens to things 

that don t bend  

He said he had 

powerful friends. 

Who was he talking about  

I don t know. 

Find out. 

Chains  

Solid gold from the mines 

outside Lannisport. 

Smithed in Casterly Rock. 

Golden chains. 

You could buy 

a ship with these. 

  Do I need a ship  

  What  

  Am I going somewhere  

  Of course you re not going anywhere. 

So  am I invited 

to your wedding  

I didn t ask for this marriage. 

  I didn t want it. 

  No  

She s a beautiful girl. 

You said so yourself. 

That doesn t mean that   

this is duty  not desire. 

Is that what you will tell 

yourself when you fuck her  

I don t have a choice. 

My father   

Does not rule the world. 

We can still go 

across the Narrow Sea. 

What would I do there  

Juggle  

I am a Lannister 

of Casterly Rock. 

And I m Shae the funny whore. 

My feelings for you 

have not changed. 

I will marry Sansa Stark 

and do my duty by her. 

While I empty her chamber pot 

and lick your cock 

when you re bored  

I swear to you 

it will not be like that. 

No  

What will it be like  

I will buy you a good home 

somewhere in the city. 

You will have fine clothes  

guards to keep 

you safe  servants. 

Any children we might have 

will be well provided for. 

Children  

You think I want children 

who can never see their father  

Who would be killed 

in their sleep 

if their grandfather 

found out about them  

Listen. 

Listen to me  my lady. 

  I m not your lady. 

  You are. 

You ll always be my lady. 

I m your whore. 

And when you are tired 

of fucking me  

I will be nothing. 

  What happened  

  Wildfire. 

I should have been here. 

After all the running 

and fighting  

here I am  

back where I started. 

Do you miss it  

  King s Landing  

  Your father s house. 

Never had a father. 

Never wanted one. 

Haven t you ever wondered 

where your strength came from  

Your talent for fighting  

I m lowborn. 

As low as can be. 

My mother was a tavern wench. 

Mine was a slave. 

So was I. 

Bought and sold  

scourged and branded  

until the Lord of Light 

reached down  

took me in his hand 

and raised me up. 

I was born in Flea Bottom. 

Your blood is noble. 

Are you saying my father  

he was some lord or... 

There. 

Your father s house. 

I m just a bastard. 

The bastard of Robert 

of the House Baratheon  

First of His Name  

King of the Andals 

and the First Men. 

Why do you think 

the gold cloaks wanted you  

There is power 

in a king s blood. 

Come sit by the fire  child. 

Not talking  eh  

That s a first. 

I don t talk to traitors. 

I didn t like 

giving up the boy. 

But you did. 

You took the gold 

and you gave him up. 

The Red God 

is the one true god. 

You ve seen his power. 

When he commands  we obey. 

He s not my one true god. 

No  

Who s yours  

Death. 

Spotted a Lannister 

raiding party. 

  How many  

   i No more than .  i  

  How far  

  Less than a day s ride south. 

What do you say  boys  

Time for a lion hunt  

Yeah  

But what about Riverrun  

It s not south. 

It s west of here. 

It will still be west of here 

two days from now. 

  You swore. 

  To take you home  and I will. 

But we need to do this first. 

Why  So you can 

steal their gold  

I swear to you  

this isn t   

I don t care what you swear 

because you re a liar. 

You lied to Gendry  

you lied to me. 

You ll lie to anyone. I hope 

the Lannisters kill you all. 

One day you ll understand  

but now   

  Anguy  bring her back. 

  Come back  girl  

Kick all you like  wolf girl. 

Won t do you no good. 

I thought you were gone. 

Tomorrow. 

Have they told you what 

they plan to do with me  

Lord Bolton s traveling 

tomorrow as well. 

He s going to the Twins 

for Edmure Tully s wedding. 

You re to remain here. 

With Locke  

I owe you a debt. 

When Catelyn Stark 

released you  

we both made a promise to her. 

 i Now it s your promise.  i  

You gave your word. 

Keep it 

and consider the debt paid. 

I will return the Stark 

girls to their mother. 

I swear it. 

Good bye  Ser Jaime. 

Here. 

Let me. 

It will take time. 

Qyburn hopes your father 

will force the Citadel 

 i to give him back his chain.  i  

My father will make 

him Grand Maester 

if he grows me a new hand. 

You will give my regards 

to Lord Tywin  I trust  

Tell Robb Stark I m sorry I 

couldn t make his uncle s wedding. 

The Lannisters send 

their regards. 

Safe journey  Kingslayer. 

Nothing to say  

I liked you better before. 

I don t remember chopping 

your balls off  too. 

And don t you worry 

about your friend. 

We ll take good care of her. 

Shh. 

Gentle  my lord. 

Gentle. 

Shh shh shh. 

Myranda knows what she s doing. 

Let her. 

She trained as a septa  only... 

she had other urges. 

So did the septons  

only they lied about it. 

Where is he  

Who  my lord  

There s no one here 

but you  me  and Violet. 

Please. 

Don t you want us to see it  

Oh  come on. 

Let us see it. 

Everybody talks about it. 

He sent you. 

Who sent us  

We sent ourselves  

Lord Greyjoy. 

We heard so much about it. 

  Please. 

  Oh  

There it is. 

Oh. 

Do you think we re ugly  

He thinks we re ugly. 

Well  he s been 

through so much. 

Look at his poor face. 

Help me. 

If he comes back... 

We need to make him 

feel better. 

And how can we make 

him feel better  

I have an idea. 

Oh  she s shy. 

You know how they are  

these religious girls. 

Maybe he doesn t 

know how we are. 

Oh. 

I felt something. 

Oh  Lord Greyjoy. 

  As good as they say  

  Mmm. 

And why should you 

get all the fun  

What  

You like her better  

Plenty there for both of us. 

I was here first. 

I m sorry. 

I m sorry. 

Terrible timing. 

But I was getting jealous. 

Well  

Should we see this cock 

everyone s always going on about  

Everyone knows you love girls. 

I bet you always thought 

they loved you back. 

Your famous cock must be 

very precious to you. 

Would you say it s 

your most precious part  

Please. 

No. 

 i No   i  

 i Mercy  please   i  

 i Please  mercy   i  

 i Mercy   i  

This is mercy. 

I m not killing you. 

 i Just making a few alterations.  i  

No  No  No  

Please  no  No  

No  No  please  

Please  

You re gonna scare it off. 

I m not gonna scare it. 

I m gonna kill it. 

It s too far away. 

Is that a palace  

It s a windmill. 

Windmill. 

Who built it  

Some king  

Just the men 

who used to live here. 

 i They must have 

been great builders   i  

 i stacking stones so high.  i  

Winterfell has towers 

three times that size. 

 I m Jon Snow 

and I m from Winterfell. 

My daddy was a fancy lord 

and I lived in a tower 

that touched the clouds.  

If you re impressed 

by a windmill  

you d be swooning if you saw 

the Great Keep at Winterfell. 

What s swooning  

Fainting. 

What s fainting  

When a girl sees blood 

and collapses. 

Why would a girl 

see blood and collapse  

Well... 

not all girls are like you. 

Well  girls see 

more blood than boys. 

Or do you like girls 

who swoon  Jon Snow  

Oh  a spider  

Save me  Jon Snow. 

My dress is made 

of the purest silk 

from Tralalalaleeday. 

I d like to see you 

in a silk dress. 

Would you  

So I could tear it off you. 

Well  you rip 

my pretty silk dress  

I ll blacken your eye. 

Maybe one day I ll take 

you to Winterfell. 

Or maybe one day 

I ll take you there. 

After we ve taken 

our land back. 

Ygritte. 

You won t win. 

I know your people are brave  

no one denies that. 

  You know nothing   

  Six times in the last thousand years  

a King beyond the Wall 

has attacked the kingdoms. 

  Six times they failed. 

  And how do you know that  

Every boy in the North 

knows it. 

We grow up learning it. 

Where the battles were fought  

the names of the heroes  

who died where. 

Six times you ve invaded 

and six times you ve failed. 

The seventh will be the same. 

  Mance is different. 

  You don t have the discipline. 

You don t have the training. 

Your army is no army. 

You don t know 

how to fight together. 

  You don t know that. 

  I do. 

I know it. 

If you attack the Wall  

you ll die. 

All of you. 

All of  i us.  i  

You re mine 

as I m yours. 

And if we die  we die. 

But first we ll live. 

Yes  first we ll live. 

What s he going on about  

And how come he always 

gets to sit and chat 

while we do all the work  

Hodor. 

  That s where we are. 

  What are you telling him  

  It s all right  Osha. 

  It s not all right. 

You think I can t 

hear you every day  

Filling his head 

with black magic. 

 i Talking about visions and 

three eyed ravens and worse.  i  

  Leave him alone. 

  He can speak for himself. 

I don t fill his head 

with anything. 

 i So what do you talk about   i  

What s happening to him 

and what that means. 

Go on  then. 

Tell us what it means. 

It s not like that. 

 i I wish I could  i  

 i tell him all the answers.  i  

 i It would be much easier.  i  

I don t want you 

talking to him anymore. 

Until we get to your brother 

at Castle Black. 

  We re not going to Castle Black. 

  What did you say  

I told you already. 

Jon Snow isn t there. 

Bran needs to find 

the raven beyond the Wall. 

Oh  no. 

I m not going back there. 

Your brother is at Castle Black. 

That s where we re going. 

Look at me. 

The raven s been coming to me 

ever since I fell 

from that tower. 

He wants me to find him. 

I don t have my legs anymore. 

This is what I have now. 

You have a family. 

You need to go back 

to Castle Black 

so you can get back to 

them where you belong. 

What if I belong in the North  

What if I fell from 

that tower for a reason  

Is that what he s telling you  

That it s all for a reason  

All these bad things happened because 

the gods got big plans for you  

I wish it were true  

little lord. 

But the gods wouldn t spare a raven s 

cold shit for you or me or anyone. 

You don t understand. 

You don t know. 

You don t know. 

None of you know. 

None of you have been up there. 

I had a man once. 

A good man. 

Bruni  his name was. 

I was his and he was mine. 

But one night Bruni disappears. 

People said he left me  

but I knew him. 

 i He d never leave me.  i  

 i Not for long.  i  

I knew he d come back. 

And he did. 

 i He came in through  i  

 i the back of the hut.  i  

Only it wasn t Bruni. 

Not really. 

His skin was pale 

like a dead man s. 

His eyes bluer than clear sky. 

 i He came at me   i  

grabbed me by the neck 

and squeezed so hard 

I could feel the life 

slipping out of me. 

 i I don t know  i  

 i how I got the knife.  i  

 i When I did  I stuck it  i  

deep into his heart. 

And he hardly seemed to notice. 

 i I had to burn our hut down  i  

 i with him inside.  i  

I didn t ask the gods 

what it meant. 

I didn t need to. 

I already knew. 

 i It meant the North  i  

 i was no place for men to be.  i  

 i Not anymore.  i  

I promised your maester 

I d get you to Castle Black 

and no further. 

How is the 

pain  my lord  

What s the purpose 

of an arm with no hand  

Well  we ve stymied 

the corruption. 

Yes  we ve stymied 

the corruption. 

You re a learned man. 

All the good it s done me. 

You did well 

sewing up this mess. 

You re far better 

at this sort of work 

than Grand Maester Pycelle. 

Faint praise  my lord. 

So why did the Citadel 

take your chain  

Did you fondle 

one boy too many  

No  my lord. 

That s not my weakness. 

What is  

Curiosity. 

The only way to treat disease 

is to understand disease. 

And the only way 

to understand it 

is to study the afflicted. 

You performed experiments 

on living men. 

  On dying men. 

  With their permission  

My studies 

have given me insight 

that has saved many lives. 

Dying paupers  I assume. 

Men with no families 

to complain. 

You found them moaning 

in the poorhouse 

and had them carted 

back to your garret 

and opened up their bellies 

to see what was inside. 

How many men have 

you killed  my lord  

I don t know. 

Countless. 

Countless has 

a nice ring to it. 

And how many lives 

have you saved  

Half a million. 

The population 

of King s Landing. 

You were in charge 

of the ravens at Harrenhal. 

Did you   did you get a bird off 

to Brienne s father in Tarth  

A bird flew off 

and a bird flew back. 

Lord Selwyn Tarth 

offered  gold dragons for 

his daughter s safe return. 

  A fair offer. 

  A fair offer. Locke won t take it. 

Why not  

He s convinced Lord Tarth 

owns all the sapphire 

mines in Westeros. 

He feels he s being cheated. 

They d be fools to kill her. 

These men have been 

at war a long time. 

Most of them 

will be dead by winter. 

She ll be their 

entertainment tonight. 

Beyond tonight  

I don t think 

they care very much. 

We have to return to Harrenhal. 

Why  

I ve left something behind. 

Absolutely not. 

I ve got orders 

from Lord Bolton. 

And what are those orders  

To deliver you to your 

father at King s Landing. 

You think you ll get a reward. 

I serve Lord Bolton. 

Any appreciation 

your father   

You think 

you re getting a reward. 

Let me explain 

something to you. 

When my father sees me  

the first thing 

he s going to ask 

is what happened to my hand. 

And I m going to tell him 

this man chopped it off. 

  I had nothing   

  Or I could tell him this man saved my life. 

We return to Harrenhal now. 

Whoa. 

  Eyes open  lads. 

  Be quiet. 

 i     The bear  the bear 

and the maiden fair      i  

 i     From there to here   i  

 i from here to there      i  

 i     All black and brown  i  

 i and covered in hair      i  

    He smelled that girl 

in the summer air     

    The bear  the bear  

and the maiden fair      

 i Don t spare her.  i  

 i Don t spare her   i  

Well  this is one shameful 

fucking performance. 

Stop running and fight. 

A wooden sword  

  I thought you d gone. 

  You gave her a wooden sword. 

We ve only got one bear. 

I ll pay her bloody ransom. 

Gold  sapphires  

whatever you want. 

Just get her out of there. 

All you lords and ladies 

still think that the only 

thing that matters is gold. 

This makes me happier 

than all your gold ever could. 

And that makes me happier 

than all her sapphires. 

So go buy yourself 

a golden hand 

and fuck yourself with it. 

Ah  

  Get behind me. 

  I will not. 

What the fuck are you 

doing to my bear  

Lord Bolton charged me 

with bringing him back 

to King s Landing alive 

and that s what I aim to do. 

Pull her up. 

Hold my legs. 

Pull him up  

The bitch stays. 

We re taking her 

to King s Landing. 

Unless you kill me. 

She belongs to me. 

Lord Bolton s orders. 

What do you think is more 

important to Lord Bolton  

Getting his pet rat a reward 

or ensuring Tywin Lannister 

gets his son back alive  

Well  we must be on our way. 

Sorry about the sapphires. 

The wolf pup has gone south. 

The North is ripe for 

the taking. 

You ll take a ship to raid the 

fishing villages on the Stony Shore 

  I m to fight fishermen  

  Be careful of their nets. 

  Lovely boy. 

  What do you want  

You re called Arry  

 i A boy could make a friend.  i  

This man has the honor 

to be Jaqen H ghar. 

 i Every night it s the same.  i  

 i I m running through  i  

 i the Godswood howling.  i  

These are dreams  

nothing more. 

My dreams are different. 

Mine are true. 

 i I saw something take that child.  i  

Wildlings serve crueler 

Gods than you or I. 

Ready my horse. 

We leave at dawn. 

Did Cersei have you 

knighted before or after 

she took you into her bed  

  Nothing to say  

  Mercy  Mercy  My Lord  

I want to know what Cersei is 

doing and you will tell me. 

Yes  My Lord  I will. 

Sweet boy  

Help us  

 i Round up any survivors.  i  

 i We ll take them  i  

 i back to Harrenhal.  i  

This one s a girl 

dressed as a boy. 

Get these prisoners to work. 

Bring the girl. 

I need a new cupbearer. 

I will give you this 

one night to reconsider. 

 i Otherwise I shall  i  

 i destroy you.  i  

Look to your sins  

Lord Renly. 

 i The night is dark  i  

 i and full of terrors.  i  

I will vouch for her  

her people and her dragons. 

Be it on your head. 

Welcome to Qarth  My Lady. 

Trust you ve not forgotten 

your smuggler s tricks. 

   i What am I bringing ashore   i  

   i The red woman.  i  

 i No one must know what you do  i  

 i and we ll not speak of this again.  i

  You swear it  

  By the mother. 

My son has no interest 

in the Iron Throne. 

Then I see no reason 

for hostility between us. 

Your son can go on calling 

himself King in the North  

the Starks will have dominion over 

all lands north of Moat Cailin  

provided he swears me 

an oath of fealty. 

And the wording 

of this oath  

The same Ned Stark swore 

to Robert  years ago. 

Cat  their friendship held 

the kingdoms together. 

And in return 

for my son s loyalty  

In the morning I ll destroy 

my brother s army. 

When that s done  

Baratheon and Stark 

will fight 

their common enemy 

together  

as they have done 

many times before. 

Our two houses 

have always been close  

which is why I am begging you 

to reconsider this battle. 

Negotiate a peace 

with your brother. 

Negotiate with Stannis  

You heard him out there. 

I d have better luck 

debating the wind. 

Please bring my terms 

to your son. 

I believe we are 

natural allies. 

I hope he feels 

the same. 

Together we could end 

this war in a fortnight. 

No  

  No. 

 i   Follow me   i  

  You ll die for this. 

  No  wait  it wasn t her  

  You ll . 

  No  wa  

We ve got to leave. 

They ll hang you 

for this. 

 i   Inside the King s tent  go   i  

  Now  

I won t leave him. 

You can t avenge him 

if you re dead. 

 i Over there  go   i  

Not that way. 

We need to go home. 

  Loras. 

  My Lord  My Lady. 

Get out. 

Stannis will be here 

in an hour. 

When he arrives  Renly s 

bannermen will flock to him. 

 i Your former companions  i  

 i will fight for the privilege  i  

of selling you 

to their new king. 

And you want that 

privilege for yourself. 

You will note that I am 

standing here talking to you  

  not Stannis. 

  There s no time for this. 

Ride back to 

Highgarden  sister. 

I m not running 

from Stannis. 

 i Brienne of Tarth  i  

 i murdered Renly.  i  

I don t believe that. 

You don t believe that. 

Who gained the most 

from our king s death  

Stannis. 

I will put a sword 

through his righteous face. 

You can t stay here. 

He would have been 

a true king  

a good king. 

 i Tell me  Ser Loras   i  

what do you desire 

most in this world  

Revenge. 

I have always found that to 

be the purest of motivations  

but you won t have a chance to 

put your sword through Stannis  

 i not today.  i  

 i You ll be cut to pieces before  i  

 i he sets foot on solid ground.  i  

If it is justice 

that you want  

be smart about it. 

You can t avenge him 

from the grave. 

Bring the horses. 

Please. 

He was very handsome. 

He was  Your Grace. 

 Your Grace.  

Calling yourself king 

doesn t make you one. 

And if Renly wasn t a king  

I wasn t a queen. 

Do you want to be a queen  

No. 

I want to be  i the  i  queen. 

Killed  

By whom  

 i Accounts differ.  i  

Most seem to implicate 

Catelyn Stark in some way. 

Really  

Who d have thought  

Some say it was one 

of his own Kingsguard  

while still others say it was 

Stannis himself who did it 

after negotiations 

went sour. 

Whomever did it  

I say well done. 

It s not what Varys says. 

He says Renly s army is 

 i flocking to support Stannis   i  

which would give Stannis superiority 

over us on both land and sea. 

Littlefinger says we can 

outspend him three to one. 

And I say father raised you to 

have too much respect for money. 

 i Stannis Baratheon  i  

 i is coming for us   i  

sooner rather than later. 

Aren t there other things 

you should be doing  

like sealing my daughter in a crate 

so you can ship her away  

She ll be safer in Dorne. 

Yes  I know how concerned 

you are for her safety. 

It so happens that I am. 

Myrcella is a sweet  

innocent girl 

and I don t blame her 

at all for you. 

So clever. 

Aren t you 

always so clever 

with your schemes 

and your plots  

Schemes and plots 

are the same thing. 

They are going 

to attack us. 

We need to be ready. 

No need to concern 

yourself over it. 

The King is taking personal 

charge of siege preparations. 

May I ask specifically 

what the King has in mind  

You may specifically 

or you may ask vaguely. 

The answer will be 

the same. 

It s important 

that we talk about this. 

It s the King s 

royal prerogative 

to withhold sensitive information 

from his councilors. 

 i It s wildfire.  i  

Wildfire  

You wouldn t lie to me  

would you  cousin  

  No. 

  That s a lie right there. 

It is not a lie. 

Why would I lie  

Tell me  

if the vile allegations 

against my brother 

and sister are true  

do you think it will 

make Jaime more likely 

to kill you or less likely  

When I tell him 

you re fucking her  I mean. 

I m telling you the truth. 

The smart money 

would be on more likely. 

She s making wildfire. 

But then perhaps his own unnatural 

urges will give him sympathy for yours. 

The alchemists  guild 

is being commissioned. 

I suppose there s only 

one way to find out. 

They have thousands of pots 

already stored in their vaults. 

They are planning to launch 

them from the city walls 

into Stannis s ships 

and armies. 

 i Please.  i  

When did she 

tell you this  

I heard her talking 

with the Pyromancer. 

And the other night 

after I left her  

she went to meet him. 

  I swear to you. 

  Swear to me on what  

  On my life. 

  But I don t care about your life. 

In the Light of the Seven  

by all that is 

holy and right  

I  Lancel Lannister  

do solemnly vow   

All right  all right. 

Enough. 

Even torturing 

you is boring. 

 i Just get out.  i  

Oh  Lancel  

tell my friend Bronn 

to please kill you if anything 

should happen to me. 

Please kill me if anything 

should happen to Lord Tyrion. 

It will be my pleasure. 

  Your Grace. 

  What is it  

Your Grace. 

I m sorry about 

your brother  Your Grace. 

I wanted to let you know 

that people grieve for him. 

Your Grace. 

  Fools love a fool. 

  Your Grace. 

I grieve for him as well   

for the boy he was  

not the man 

he grew to be. 

I need to speak to you about 

what I saw in that cave. 

I thought I made it clear 

to you there d be no need to 

speak to me on this matter. 

Your Grace  I   

I ve never known you to 

need to hear a thing twice. 

And I ve never known you 

to hide from the truth. 

You ve come to lecture 

me on truth  

I ve come to tell you 

that what I saw   

All my brother s bannermen 

have come to my side. 

Except the Tyrells  

who fled like cowards. 

They won t be able 

to resist us now. 

Soon I shall be sitting 

on the Iron Throne. 

Nothing is worth 

what this will cost you  

  not even the Iron   

  I ll hear no more about it. 

 i Take a company of men   i  

 i secure the perimeter.  i  

When do we sail 

for King s Landing  

As soon as I ve 

consolidated my troops. 

We ll make short work 

of the Lannisters  fleet. 

Once Blackwater Bay 

is cleared  

we ll deliver our troops to their 

doorstep and take the city. 

And will you bring 

Lady Melisandre with you  

That s not your concern. 

If you take King s Landing with her 

by your side  the victory will be hers. 

I never thought I d have reason to 

doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong  

Loyal service means 

telling hard truths. 

Oh  truth again. 

All right  

what s the truth  

The hard truth  

 i She s a foreigner  i  

preaching her 

foreign religion. 

Some believe she whispers orders 

in your ear and you obey. 

What do you believe  

You won those bannermen 

from Renly. 

Don t lose them to her. 

We set out for King s Landing 

without Lady Melisandre. 

And you lead the fleet 

into Blackwater Bay. 

Your Grace  I m honored  

but my time on the sea 

was spent evading ships  

not attacking them. 

The other lords 

won t be happy. 

Most of those lords should 

consider themselves lucky 

I don t hang them 

for treason. 

Hard truths cut 

both ways  Ser Davos. 

 i I ve got it   i  

 i I ve got it   i  

 i So it s that one there  i  

 i at the top  on the right.  i  

Buy my fruit  My Lord. 

Fresh fruit. 

Stannis has more infantry  

more ships  more horses. 

What do we have  

There s that mind of yours 

you keep going on about. 

Well  I ve never actually been 

able to kill people with it. 

Good thing. 

I d be out of a job. 

 i What about your father   i  

He hasn t sent 

a raven in weeks. 

He s very busy. 

Being repeatedly humiliated by 

Robb Stark is time consuming. 

We won t be able to hold 

the city against Stannis  

not the way Joffrey s 

planning on holding it. 

Corruption  yes. 

We are swollen  

bloated  foul. 

Brother fornicates with sister 

in the bed of Kings 

and we re surprised when the 

fruit of their incest is rotten  

Yes  a rotten king. 

It s hard to argue 

with his assessment. 

Not after what he did 

to your birthday present. 

The King is a lost cause. 

It s the rest of us 

I m worried about now. 

A dancing king  prancing 

down his bloodstained halls 

to the tune of a twisted 

demon monkey. 

You have to admire 

his imagination. 

  He s talking about you. 

  What  

Demon monkey  

People think you re pulling 

the King s strings. 

They blame you 

for the city s ills. 

Blame me  

I m trying to save them. 

You don t need 

to convince me. 

Demon monkey. 

 i   Seagulls screeching  i  

Yeah  come on. 

You re the crew 

of the sea bitch  

I m your commander. 

Welcome. 

Stop. 

Stop  

Your Captain commands 

you to stop. 

Where are we 

heading  Captain  

The Stony Shore 

to raid their villages. 

 i There ll be spoils  i  

 i in it for you  and women   i  

if you do your jobs well. 

And who decides if we ve 

done our jobs well  

I do. 

Your Captain. 

I have been reaving 

and raping 

since before you left 

Balon s balls  Captain. 

Don t reckon I ve got much use 

for your ideas on how to do it. 

Don t reckon I ve got 

much use for a captain at all. 

I m thinking I can do the job 

of captain real well myself. 

All I need is a ship. 

You wouldn t know 

where I could find myself 

a ship now  would you  

You could do that  

take the ship  

head out on your own. 

And I will hunt you down  

drag you back here in chains  

and hang you for a traitor. 

Stop. We yield. 

Congratulations 

on your first command. 

Thank you. Kind of you 

to come see me off. 

Oh  I m not here 

for you. 

I was just on my way 

to Red Harbor. 

I ve got  ships. There s 

nowhere to put them here. 

  Too narrow. 

  You d better get out there. 

Wouldn t want them 

to set sail without you. 

That would never happen. 

My crew would wait on deck 

for a year if I asked them to. 

This lot  though... 

Enjoy the Stony Shore. 

Come on  

I ll take you out. 

Who are you  

Dagmer  your first mate. 

Why aren t you with 

the rest of them  

Or did they send you to row me 

out and dump me halfway in the sea  

That would be good 

for a laugh. 

They re not gonna respect you 

until you prove yourself. 

And how am I supposed 

to prove myself by pillaging 

piss poor fishing villages  

You re not. 

And yet that s the task 

my father has given me 

to prove that 

I m a true Iron Islander. 

 i They re all Iron Islanders.  i  

Do they do as they re told 

or do they do as they like  

The Stony Shore s not far 

from Torrhen s Square. 

The seat of the House 

of Tallhart   

a more impressive prize than 

a few fishermen s daughters. 

What  you don t think 

we could take it  

No  we could. 

We could never hold it 

for more than a few days. 

As soon as Winterfell got word that 

we d taken Torrhen s Square  

the Starks would send 

their men to take it back. 

And then   

take me to my ship. 

The Starks have 

overextended their lines. 

Now that summer s over  

they ll have a hard time 

keeping their men 

and horses fed. 

The Starks understand winter 

better than we ever will. 

The cold won t beat them. 

Our spies report growing 

discontent among the northern lords. 

They want to return home 

and gather the harvest 

before the crops turn. 

And I m sure if those same spies 

snuck into our own encampments  

they would report growing discontent 

amongst the southern lords. 

This is war  

No one s content. 

We ve underestimated 

the Stark boy for too long. 

He has a good mind for warfare  

his men worship him. 

And as long as he keeps 

winning battles  

they ll keep believing 

he is King in the North. 

You ve been waiting 

for him to fail. 

He is not going to fail  

not without our help. 

So how do we stop him  

 i We ve worked through  i  

 i the night  My Lord.  i  

Perhaps we d profit 

from some sleep. 

As I think 

you would  Reginald. 

And because 

you re my cousin  

I might even let you 

wake from that sleep. 

Go  I m sure your wife 

must miss you. 

My wife s in Lannisport. 

Well  then you d 

better start riding. 

Go before I change my mind 

and send her your head. 

If your name 

wasn t Lannister  

you d be scrubbing out pots 

in the cook s tent. Go  

Not wine  water. 

We ll be here 

for some time. 

Girl. 

Where are you from  

Maidenpool  My Lord. 

And who are the Lords 

of Maidenpool  

  Remind me. 

  House Mooton  My Lord. 

And what is their Sigil  

A red salmon. 

I think a Maidenpool girl 

would remember that. 

You re a northerner  

aren t you  

Good. One more time  

where are you from  

Barrowton  My Lord. 

House Dustin. 

Two crossed longaxes 

beneath a black crown. 

And what do they say 

of Robb Stark in the North  

They call him 

the young wolf. 

And  

They say he rides into battle on 

the back of a giant Direwolf. 

They say he can turn into 

a wolf himself when he wants. 

They say he can t be killed. 

And do you believe them  

No  My Lord. 

Anyone can be killed. 

Fetch that water. 

A girl says nothing. 

A girl keeps 

her mouth closed. 

 i No one hears   i  

and friends may talk 

in secret  yes  

A boy becomes a girl. 

I was always a girl. 

And I was always aware. 

But the girl 

keeps secrets. 

 i It is not for a man  i  

 i to spoil them.  i  

You re one of them now. 

I should have let you burn. 

And you fetch water 

for one of them now. 

Why is this right for you 

and wrong for me  

I didn t have a choice. 

You did. 

I did. 

And here we are. 

A man pays his debts. 

A man owes three. 

Three what  

The Red God takes 

what is his  lovely girl. 

And only death 

may pay for life. 

You saved me 

and the two I was with. 

You stole three deaths 

from the Red God. 

We have to give them back. 

Speak three names 

and the man 

will do the rest. 

Three lives 

I will give you   

no more  no less  

and we re done. 

I can name anyone 

and you ll kill him  

A man has said. 

The one who 

tortures everyone. 

A man needs a name. 

I don t know his name. 

They call him 

the Tickler. 

That is enough. 

Go now  girl. 

Your master is thirsty. 

 i He s not here yet.  i  

He d have seen us  

blown the horn. 

When will he come  

The Halfhand does things 

in his own time. 

My uncle told me 

stories about him. 

Most of them are true. 

I heard the Halfhand spent half 

of last winter beyond the wall. 

The whole winter. 

He was north of the Skirling Pass 

when the snows came. 

Had to wait for the thaw. 

So it is possible for someone 

to survive out here on their own. 

Well  possible 

for the Halfhand. 

Beautiful  isn t it  

Gilly would love it here. 

There s nothing more sickening 

than a man in love. 

 i About time you did something.  i  

 i At least you ll keep warm.  i  

The fist 

of the First Men. 

Think of how old 

this place is   

before the Targaryens 

defeated the Hendals  

before the Andals took 

Westeros from the First Men. 

Before I die  please  

stop talking. 

Thousands and thousands 

of years ago  

the First Men stood here 

where we re standing 

all through the long night. 

What do you think they 

were like  the First Men  

Stupid. 

Smart people don t find 

themselves in places like this. 

I think 

they were afraid. 

I think they came here 

to get away from something. 

And I don t think 

it worked. 

Wildlings  

One blast is for rangers returning. 

Wildlings is two blasts. 

So you got to stand 

there waiting  

 i wondering.  i  

 i One blast for friends   i  

 i two for foes.  i  

And three 

for White Walkers. 

It s been   years  

but that s the only time 

they blow the horn three times. 

But if it s been   years  

how do you know  

  Well... 

  I read it in a book. 

Look. 

It s Qhorin Halfhand. 

Aye  we ll live 

another day. 

Hurrah. 

Take care  My Lord. 

I remember reading 

an old sailor s proverb   

 piss on wildfire 

and your cock burns off.  

Oh  I have not conducted 

this experiment. 

It could well be true. 

The substance 

burns so hot  

it melts wood  

stone  even steel  

and  of course  flesh. 

The substance burns so hot  

it melts flesh like tallow. 

After the dragons died  

wildfire was the key 

to the Targaryen power. 

My companion takes issue. 

If I could tell you 

how many crazy old men 

I ve seen pushing carts 

around army camps 

making grand claims about 

jars full of pig shit... 

  No offense meant. 

  Our order does not deal in pig shit. 

The substance 

is fire given form. 

And we have been perfecting it 

since the days of Maegor. 

To do what  

The jars are put in catapults 

and flung at the enemy. 

How much do you have  

If you could get real soldiers 

to man the catapults  

then maybe you d hit 

your target one time in   

but all the real soldiers are in 

the Riverlands with your father. 

My Lord  this man 

is insulting. 

I don t know if you ve 

ever seen a battle  old man  

but things can get 

a bit messy. 

 Cause when we re flinging 

things at Stannis  

he s flinging them 

right back at us. 

Men die  men shit 

themselves  men run  

which means 

pots falling  

which means fire 

inside the walls  

which means the poor cunts 

trying to defend the city 

end up burning it down. 

My friend remains 

unconvinced. 

He would not dare 

insult my order 

whilst Aerys Targaryen 

lived. 

Well  he s not 

living anymore. 

And all his pots of wildfire 

didn t help him  did they  

Men win wars  

not magic tricks. 

We have been working 

tirelessly day and night 

ever since your royal sister 

commanded us to do so. 

Our present count stands 

at    

enough to burn Stannis 

Baratheon s fleet 

and armies both. 

This is a shit idea. 

I m afraid I have to concur 

with my advisor  wisdom Hallyne. 

The contents of this room 

could lay King s Landing low. 

You won t be making wildfire 

for my sister any longer. 

You ll be making it 

for me. 

Dracarys. 

Dracarys. 

He ll be able to feed 

himself from now on. 

 i Let him sleep  Doreah.  i  

Yes  Khaleesi. 

He loves you. 

Thank you  my friend. 

Did you see the dress 

Xaro had made for you  

They say he s the 

wealthiest man in Qarth. 

It is known. 

And if Qarth is the wealthiest 

city in Essos   

The last time a rich man 

gave me a dress  

he was selling me 

to Khal Drogo. 

Xaro is our host  

but we know nothing about him. 

Men like to talk 

about other men 

when they re happy. 

You would look like 

a real princess in Xaro s   

She s not a princess. 

She s a Khaleesi. 

You should wear it  

Khaleesi. 

You are their guest. 

It would be rude not to. 

And you must visit 

the night market. 

The Qartheen night market is like 

no night market you ve ever seen. 

It sounds wonderful. 

The Meereens think 

they have a night market. 

I will take you 

there myself. 

Please excuse me 

for a moment. 

What are they doing  

Malakko says the statue 

is too heavy to carry. 

Kovarro says that 

Malakko is an idiot. 

 i They can pry out the gems   i  

 i the rest is pure gold.  i  

Very soft. He can chop off 

as much as we can carry. 

My brother used to say the only 

thing the Dothraki knew how to do 

was steal things 

better men have built. 

It s not the only thing. 

They re quite good 

at killing the better men. 

That s not the kind of queen 

I m going to be. 

Mother of Dragons. 

On behalf of the warlocks 

of Qarth  

I welcome you. 

A demonstration  

Take this gem. 

Look at it. 

Into its depths. 

So many facets. 

Look closely enough and you 

can see yourself in them. 

Often more than once. 

Should you grow tired of 

Xaro s baubles and trinkets  

it would be an honor to host you 

at the House of the Undying. 

You re always welcome  

Mother of Dragons. 

My apologies. 

Pyat Pree is one 

of the Thirteen. 

It was customary for me 

to extend him an invitation. 

Customs die 

slow deaths in Qarth. 

What is the House 

of the Undying  

It is where the warlocks go 

to squint at dusty books 

and drink shade 

of the evening. 

It turns their lips blue 

and their minds soft   

so soft  

they actually believe 

their parlor tricks 

are magic. 

 i You watch over her.  i  

Do I know you  

I know you. 

Jorah Mormont 

of Bear Island. 

Who are you  

I m no one. 

But she is 

the Mother of Dragons. 

She needs true protectors 

now more than ever. 

They shall come 

day and night 

to see the wonder born 

into the world again. 

And when they see  

they shall lust  

for dragons are fire 

made flesh. 

And fire is power. 

It looked like Stannis. 

To me it just 

looked like... 

A shadow in 

the shape of a man. 

In the shape 

of Stannis. 

We should reach 

my son s camp tomorrow. 

Will you stay there 

long  My Lady  

Only long enough to tell 

Robb what I have seen. 

After that  I will leave 

for Winterfell. 

My two youngest need me. 

I ve been away from them 

for far too long. 

I never knew my mother. 

I m sorry. 

My own mother died 

on the birthing bed 

when I was very young. 

It s a bloody business. 

What comes after 

is even harder. 

Once you re safely back 

amongst your own people  

will you give me leave 

to go  My Lady  

You mean to kill Stannis. 

I swore a vow. 

But Stannis has 

a great army around him. 

His own guards are sworn 

to keep him safe. 

 i I m as good  i  

 i as any of them.  i  

I should never have fled. 

Renly s death 

was no fault of yours. 

You served him bravely. 

I only held him 

that once 

as he was dying. 

He s gone  Brienne. 

You serve nothing and no one 

by following him into the earth. 

Renly s enemies are 

Robb s enemies as well. 

I do not know 

your son  My Lady... 

but I could serve you 

if you would have me. 

 i You have courage.  i  

Not battle courage  perhaps  

but  I don t know  

a woman s kind of courage. 

 i And I think that  i  

 i when the time comes   i  

 i you will not hold me back.  i  

Promise me that you 

will not hold me back 

from Stannis. 

When the time comes  

I will not hold you back. 

Then I am yours  

My Lady. 

I will shield your back 

and give my life for yours 

if it comes to that. 

I swear it by the Old Gods 

and the new. 

I vow that you shall always 

have a place in my home 

and at my table 

and that I shall ask 

no service of you 

that might 

bring you dishonor. 

I swear it by the Old Gods 

and the new. 

 i And it s not  i  

 i just thieves  My Lord.  i  

 i There s wolves  i  

 i in them hills now   i  

more than I ve ever seen. 

They come down in the night 

and they kill my sheep. 

My three sons is away fighting 

for your brother  My Lord. 

They ll fight  

keep fighting 

till they re told 

to go home. 

I have no one to man 

my flock now. Only me. 

I can t keep watch 

all day and all night. 

We can send two orphan boys 

from Winterstown home with you 

to help watch over 

your flock 

if you can give them 

room and board. 

My wife always prayed 

for more children. 

We ll look after them. 

Thank you  My Lord. 

And may the Gods 

bless you and yours. 

Stop it. 

If that s everyone  I m going 

to go for a ride before dark. 

  Good. 

  Hodor. 

  Hodor. 

Bran   Lord Stark. 

Torrhen s Square 

is under siege. 

Torrhen s Square is barely 

 leagues from here. 

 i How can the Lannisters  i  

 i strike so far north   i  

Might be a raiding party 

led by the Mountain. 

Might be Sellswords 

paid by Tywin Lannister. 

We have to help them. 

Most of the fighting men 

are away with Robb  

but I can gather 

 decent men. 

Do you need so many  

If we can t protect 

our own bannermen  

why should 

they protect us  

Go  Ser Rodrik. 

Take the men you need. 

Won t take long  My Lord. 

Southerners don t 

do well up here. 

So  what does it mean  

Ask your Maester Luwin. 

He s the one studying 

books all the time. 

I did ask him. He d never 

heard of a three eyed raven. 

  Must not mean anything  then 

  You re lying. 

You might be a little lord  

but don t you call me a liar. 

  You know what it means. 

  I never said I didn t. 

You didn t give me 

an honest answer. 

That s not the same 

as being a liar. 

Well  it s not far off. 

So  you ve been dreaming 

of a three eyed raven again  

In the Godswood  

you told me you didn t dream. 

Now who s a liar  

What did you see 

in your dream  

Something bad  

Tell me  boy. 

I dreamt that the sea 

came to Winterfell. 

I saw waves crashing 

against the gates 

and the water came 

flowing over the walls... 

 i flooded the castle.  i  

Drowned men 

were floating here 

in the yard. 

Ser Rodrik 

was one of them. 

The sea is hundreds 

of miles away. 

I know. 

It s just a stupid dream. 

I ve got to get these 

potatoes to the kitchen. 

Otherwise they ll put me 

in chains again. 

Osha. 

The three eyed raven  

what do they say about it 

north of the wall  

They say all sorts of crazy 

things north of the wall. 

  There. 

 i   Where   i  

On that Mountain. 

I don t see very well. 

A fire. 

There s a fire. 

 i The people sitting around it have  i  

 i better eyes than yours or mine.  i  

When they see us coming  

that fire becomes a signal. 

Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time. 

to throw a party in our honor. 

How many wildlings 

have joined him  

From what we can tell  

all of them. 

 i Mance has gathered them all  i  

 i like deer against the wolves.  i  

 i They re almost ready  i  

 i to make their move.  i  

Where  

Somewhere safe. 

Somewhere south. 

 i Can t just march  i  

 i into their midst.  i  

And we can t wait for them 

here with nothing but a pile 

of stones to protect us. 

You saying we should 

fall back to the Wall  

Mance was one of us once. 

Now he s one of them. 

He s gonna teach them 

our way of doing things. 

They ll hit us in force. 

And they won t run away 

when we hit back. 

 i They re gonna be more  i  

 i organized than before   i  

 i more disciplined  i  

more like us. 

So we need to be 

more like them  

do things their way. 

Sneak in  kill Mance  

and scatter them 

to the winds 

before they can march 

on the Wall. 

And to do that... 

We need to get rid 

of those lookouts. 

It s not a job 

for  men. 

I need to move fast 

and silent. 

Harker  Stonesnake  

Borba. 

Lord Commander  I d like 

to join Lord Qhorin. 

I ve been called 

lots of things  

but that might be 

my first Lord Qhorin. 

You re a steward  

Snow  not a ranger. 

I ve fought 

and killed a Wight. 

How many rangers 

can say that  

He s the one  

Aye. 

You killed a Wight. 

You also let an old man 

beat you bloody 

and take your sword. 

 i Craster   i  

In the boy s defense  

that s a tough old goat. 

I could take up Jon s duties 

while he s gone  My Lord. 

It would be no trouble. 

Well  I hope you make 

a better ranger 

than you do a steward. 

Go on. 

 i So  tell me   i  

how long has your manservant 

been in love with you  

He s not my manservant 

and he s not in love with me. 

He s my advisor  

my friend. 

Unlikely. 

I can almost always tell 

what a man wants. 

And what about 

what a woman wants  

Much more complicated. 

You  for example  

what do you want  

To cross the Narrow Sea 

and take back the Iron Throne. 

Why  

Because I promised 

my Khalasar I d protect them 

and find them a safe home. 

You want to conquer 

the Seven Kingdoms  

I want them because 

they re mine by right. 

The Iron Throne is mine 

and I will take it. 

Ah  a conqueror. 

And how did you get 

all of this  

  Did someone give it to you  

  No. 

I come from nothing. 

I hit the docks 

like a piece of cargo  

except someone normally 

cares what happens to cargo. 

So you wanted more than 

you had and you took it. 

You re a conqueror  too. 

you re just less ambitious. 

Mmm. 

What do you want  

Xaro Zhoan Daxos  

At the gates of the city  

you bled for me. 

Why  

I will show you why. 

The door and the vault 

is made of Valyrian stone. 

The hardest steel 

does not make a mark. 

I offered the greatest 

locksmiths in Qarth 

their weight in gold 

if they could break into it. 

I made the same offer 

to the greatest thieves. 

They all went home 

empty handed. 

The only thing that 

can open this door 

is this key. 

And behind the door  

And it can all be mine  

All  

Let us say half. 

More than enough to buy 

horses  ships  armies   

enough to go home. 

All I have to do  

Is marry me. 

That was a romantic proposal. 

I ve already married 

once for love  

but the Gods 

stole her from me. 

I come from nothing. 

My mother and father 

never owned a pair of shoes. 

But marry me and I will 

give you the Seven Kingdoms 

and our children will be 

Princes and Princesses. 

See  

I have more ambition 

than you thought. 

The time is right  

Daenerys Targaryen  

first of your name. 

Robert Baratheon 

is dead. 

 i If you cross the sea  i  

 i with an army you bought    i  

The Seven Kingdoms are 

at war with one another. 

Four false kings 

destroying the country. 

To win Westeros  you need 

support from Westeros. 

The usurper is dead. 

The Starks fight 

the Lannisters  

and Baratheons 

fight each other. 

According to 

your new friend 

who earned your trust 

by cutting his hand  

The time to strike is now. We need 

to find ships and an army 

or we ll spend the rest 

of our lives rotting away 

at the edge of the world. 

Rich men do not become rich 

by giving more than they get. 

They ll give you ships and soldiers 

and they ll own you forever. 

Moving carefully is the hard way  

but it s the right way. 

And if I d listened 

to that advice 

outside the gates of Qarth  

we d all be dead by now. 

I know the opportunity before you 

seems like the last you ll ever have  

but you must   

Do not speak to me 

like I m a child. 

  I only want   

  What do you want  

Tell me. 

To see you 

on the Iron Throne. 

  Why  

  You have a good claim. 

A title. 

A birthright. 

But you have something 

more than that. 

You may cover it up and deny it  

but you have a gentle heart. 

You would not only 

be respected and feared  

you would be loved. 

Someone who can rule 

and should rule. 

Centuries come and go 

without a person like that 

coming into the world. 

There are times 

when I look at you 

and still can t 

believe you re real. 

So what would you 

have me do as my advisor  

 i Make your own way.  i  

Find your own ship. 

You only need one. 

The allies we need 

are in Westeros  not Qarth. 

And how do I get 

the ship  

 i I ll find it for you.  i  

A sound ship 

with a good captain. 

I look forward 

to meeting him. 

Khaleesi. 

You should stand 

sideface. 

Sideface  

Sideways. 

  Why  

  Smaller target. 

Am I fighting someone  

You re practicing 

for a fight. 

You should practice right. 

Guards  

  Help. 

  Did you see anything  

Go up there. Go and see where 

he fell from. 

Go up the back. 

 i That is strange.  i  

Move away. 

 i Stand back.  i  

 i He s dead.  i

Easy  easy. 

Easy. 

What do you remember  

They stabbed me. 

Olly... 

he put a knife in my heart. 

I shouldn t be here. 

The lady brought you back. 

Afterwards  after they stabbed you  

after you died  where did you go  

What did you see  

Nothing. 

There was nothing at all. 

The Lord let you come back for a reason. 

Stannis was not the 

prince who was promised  

but someone has to be. 

Could you give us a moment  

You were dead. 

And now you re not. 

That s completely fucking 

mad  seems to me. 

I can only imagine how it seems to you. 

I did what I thought was right. 

And I got murdered for it. 

And now I m back. 

Why  

I don t know. 

Maybe we ll never know. 

What does it matter  

You go on. 

You fight for as long as you can. 

You clean up as much of 

the shit as you can. 

I don t know how to do that. 

I thought I did  but... 

I failed. 

Good. 

Now go fail again. 

They think you re some kind of god. 

The man who returned from the dead. 

I m not a god. 

I know that. 

I saw your pecker. 

What kind of god would 

have a pecker that small  

Your eyes are still brown. 

Is that still you in there  

I think so. 

Hold off on burning my body for now. 

That s funny. 

You sure that s still you in there  

You all right  

Yes. Yes  I m fine. 

Did I ever tell you I used to 

think the sea was called the see 

because it was nothing but water 

as far as the eye could see  

I don t think so. 

Sea  see. 

They re spelled different  

but they sound the same. 

Yeah  they do. 

It was before I learned 

how to read  obviously. 

Sam  are you going to be sick  

Won t be long. We ll 

be in the south soon. 

I m excited to see Oldtown. 

Captain says it s the most 

beautiful city in Westeros. 

Are you going to vomit again  

No. No  no  no. I m... 

The Citadel doesn t admit women. 

There won t be a place for 

you there or for Little Sam. 

I stayed at Castle Black. 

There s no women allowed there. 

The Citadel isn t Castle Black. 

I don t have a Jon Snow or Maester 

Aemon to help me bend the rules. 

I ll stay in Oldtown  then. 

By yourself  

With a baby and no money  

So if we re not going to Oldtown  

where are you taking me  

To my home. 

Horn Hill. 

My father s... well  my father  

but my mother s a kind woman 

and my sister s lovely. 

They ll take care of you both. 

 Wherever you go  I go  too.  

That s what you said. 

I said that because I want you 

and Little Sam to be safe. 

That s all I want... 

to become a maester so I can 

help Jon when the time comes 

so you ll be safe. 

Us and everyone else in the world. 

I don t care about them. 

Well  no  I do  but I don t really. 

I care about you and him. 

I know that  Sam. 

And he does  too. 

You re the only one who ever has. 

If you think it s for the best  

we trust you. 

I d feel better if you threw 

something at me and stormed off. 

I d never do that to 

the father of my son. 

That s my father. 

The man beside him is Howland Reed  

Meera s father. 

Ser Arthur Dayne. 

The Sword of the Morning. 

Father said he was the best 

swordsman he ever saw. 

Lord Stark. 

I looked for you on the Trident. 

We weren t there. 

Your friend the usurper 

would lie beneath the 

ground if we had been. 

The Mad King is dead. 

Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. 

Why weren t you there 

to protect your prince  

Our prince wanted us here. 

Where s my sister  

I wish you good fortune 

in the wars to come. 

And now it begins. 

No. 

Now it ends. 

He s better than my father. 

Far better. 

But Father beat him. 

Did he  

I know he did. 

Heard the story a thousand times. 

He stabbed him in the back. 

What s in the tower  

That s enough for one day. 

We ll visit again another time. 

  I want to see where he s going. 

  Time to go. 

Father  

Why did you do that  

Take me back there. I want to go back. 

No. 

  He heard me. 

  Maybe. 

  Maybe he heard the wind. 

  He heard me. 

The past is already written. 

The ink is dry. 

What s in that tower  

I want to go back there. 

I ve told you many times  stay too long 

where you don t belong and 

you will never return. 

Why do I want to return  

So I can be a cripple again  

So I can talk to an old man in a tree  

You think I wanted to sit 

here for   years 

watching the world from a distance 

as the roots grew through me  

So why did you  

I was waiting for you. 

I don t want to be you. 

I don t blame you. 

You won t be here forever. 

You won t be an old man in a tree. 

But before you leave  

you must learn. 

Learn what  

Everything. 

I don t know how you stand 

it in all that leather. 

If we could have the room. 

You look lovely today  my dear. 

You really do. 

How you climbed all those steps 

without breaking a sweat. 

If you re going to torture me  

just call them back and get on with it. 

I am not a torturer. 

Though it so often is 

what people deserve. 

And it does provide answers. 

But they re usually the wrong answers. 

My job is to find the right answers. 

Do you know how I do that  

I do it by making people happy. 

I d like to make you happy  Vala. 

That s your name  isn t it  Vala  

That s all right. 

I know who you are and what you ve done. 

You ve done a lot. 

You ve sacrificed your body for a cause  

which is more than most people do. 

And you ve helped the Sons of the Harpy 

murder the Unsullied 

and the Second Sons. 

The Unsullied and the Second 

Sons are foreign soldiers 

brought here by a foreign queen 

to destroy our city and our history. 

I understand. 

Well  that makes perfect sense 

from your perspective. 

I have a different 

perspective  of course. 

I think it s important that you try 

to see things from my perspective 

just as I will try to 

see them from yours. 

Because that is the only way 

that I can make you and Dom happy. 

That is how you pronounce it... Dom  

I m afraid I don t really 

speak the language. 

Such a handsome boy. 

Those big  brown eyes. Good 

luck keeping the ladies away. 

Yes  you re a true 

liberator  aren t you  

You won t torture me  you ll 

just threaten my son. 

Children are blameless. 

I have never hurt them. 

Your boy is in no immediate danger  

this I swear to you. 

But between us  dear  

you did conspire to kill 

the queen s soldiers. 

We both know the penalty for that crime. 

How will poor Dom get 

on without his mother  

And with his breathing problem. 

If I tell you anything  they ll kill me. 

So either you kill me or they do. 

Yes  from your perspective  

this is a problem. 

There is a third option  though. 

A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. 

I ve already booked passage for 

a woman and her young son. 

I ll even throw in a bag of 

silver to help you start again. 

Though I m afraid we ll have to ask 

one of our leather clad 

friends back in to carry it. 

Far too heavy for me. 

The boat sails at dawn. 

You need to decide now. 

A new life for you and Dom 

or... 

What should we do while we wait  

To pass the time  what should we do  

What should we talk about  

You speak  languages. 

You must occasionally use some 

of them to talk about things. 

You two  you spend a great 

deal of time together. 

What would you be talking 

about if I weren t here  

Patrol. 

When I am going on patrol 

with the Unsullied. 

What we see on patrol. 

Who we captured on patrol. 

That s good. That s very good. 

But that s a report. 

I was thinking more of a conversation. 

A wise man once said the 

true history of the world 

is the history of great 

conversations in elegant rooms. 

Who said this  

Me. 

Just now. 

All right  no conversations. 

Let s play a game. 

You don t play games  

either one of you  ever  

Games are for children. 

My master Kraznys would 

sometimes make us play games. 

There  that s a start. 

  Only the girls. 

  No  no  no. 

Not that. Of course not that. 

Innocent games. Fun games. 

Drinking games. 

We do not drink. 

Until you do. 

All right. No drinking. 

We can play without drinking. 

It s a wonderful game. I invented it. 

Here s how it works. 

I make a statement about your past. 

If I m wrong  I drink. 

And if I m right... 

maybe we can t play without drinking. 

Oh  you took your time. 

Sorry. 

I was busy learning who funds 

the Sons of the Harpy. 

  Some things you can t rush. 

  You found out  

The Good Masters of Astapor 

and the Wise Masters of Yunkai. 

With help from their 

friends in Volantis. 

You see  

You don t even have to worry 

about the local rebellion. 

We only have to worry about 

the three rich foreign 

cities paying for it. 

We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once. 

We will do it again and 

execute the Masters. 

If the Unsullied march off to 

reconquer Astapor and Yunkai  

who will remain to defend 

the free people of Meereen  

If we do not fight them  

how can we stop them  

We cannot. 

The Masters speak only one language. 

They spoke it to me for many years. 

I know it better than my mother tongue. 

If we want them to hear us  we 

must speak it back to them. 

May it be the last thing they ever hear. 

You may be right. 

So we will fight them  

  Possibly. 

  Possibly  

It s a conversation. 

Tell me  can your little 

birds get a message 

to the Good Masters of Astapor  

the Wise Masters of Yunkai  

and benevolent enslavers of Volantis  

Of course. Men can be fickle  

but birds I always trust. 

exclusive from  tusubt itulo  .co m 

Your eye looks much better  Arthur. 

How s your mother s jaw  

Better. 

And your father  

No one s seen him. 

And no one will. 

That worked out rather nicely. 

Will Lord Varys ever come back  

I don t think so. 

Do you miss him  

He was nice. 

He called us his little birds. 

He gave us sweets. 

It s funny you should mention that. 

Guess what I happened to find today. 

Candied plums from Dorne. 

Now remember  if any of your friends 

like sweets or need help  

they can always come to me. 

All I need in return are whispers. 

No need to be afraid. 

This is Ser Gregor. 

He s friends with all my friends. 

Run along now. 

Varys s little birds  

Your little birds now  Your Grace. 

What did you do to him exactly  

I haven t been able to 

get a clear answer. 

Oh  a number of things. 

Does he understand what we re saying  

I mean  to the extent 

that he ever understood 

complete sentences in the first place. 

He understands well enough. 

So tell him to march into the sept 

and crush the High Sparrow s 

head like a melon. 

The High Sparrow has hundreds of 

Faith Militant surrounding him. 

Ser Gregor can t face them all. 

And he won t have to. 

He ll only have to face one. 

Has the Faith leveled 

official charges yet  

Not yet. 

That is one trial by combat 

I look forward to watching. 

Don t stop at the city. 

I want little birds in Dorne  

in Highgarden  in the North. 

If someone is planning on 

making our losses their gains  

I want to hear it. 

If someone is laughing at the queen 

who walked naked through the 

streets covered in shit  

I want to hear. 

I want to know who they are. 

I want to know where they are. 

  As bad as Lord Varys was  

  Qyburn is worse. 

I told them all. I told them. 

He s arrogant  dangerous. 

You don t get thrown out of the 

Citadel without good reason. 

And no one listened to my advice. 

So here we are. 

And what he s done to Gregor 

Clegane is an abomination. 

We never sanctioned this experiment. 

I for one think it will 

be in our best interest 

to have the beast dest... 

  Can I help you  

  Why are you here  

  My mother... 

  I was invited  my dear  

to help deal with several 

troublesome issues  

such as the queen s imprisonment. 

Thank you for bringing it up. 

It s well past time we addressed 

the abuses I endured. 

Margaery is the queen. 

You are not the queen 

because you re not married to the king. 

I do appreciate these things 

can get a bit confusing in your family. 

This is a small council meeting. 

You have no position 

on the small council. 

I m the Lord Commander 

of the Kingsguard. 

The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard 

does have a position 

on the small council. 

Grand Maester Pycelle  would 

you sanction that statement  

Well... 

I would say Ser Gerold Hightower 

had a seat on the Mad King s council. 

Of course  that was the Mad King. 

King Robert saw things differently. 

And King... 

What about Myrcella s death  Uncle  

Do you consider the 

murder of your own blood 

a troublesome issue  

The same women who murdered Myrcella 

have overthrown House Martell 

and taken control of Dorne. 

We ve got a lot to discuss. 

All of us together. 

And seeing as you cannot make us 

leave  we best get on with it. 

No  we cannot make you leave. 

And you cannot make us stay. 

Not unless you re gonna have 

that thing murder us all. 

VISIT US   TU SUBT TITULO .C.O M. 

Your Grace. 

My mother would like to see her 

daughter s final resting place. 

I m sorry  Your Grace. 

That s not possible. Not yet. 

When will it be possible  

When she s fully atoned for her sins. 

You cut off her hair 

and marched her naked 

through the streets in 

front of the whole city. 

That wasn t the full atonement   

No. 

She must stand trial 

before seven septons 

so we can learn the true 

extent of her sins. 

I want you to let her see 

Myrcella s resting place. 

I am the king. 

You are. 

And what does that mean to you  

It means a great deal to me. 

The Crown and the Faith 

are the twin pillars of the world. 

Do you know who told me that  

Your mother. 

My mother who is unclean  

My mother who still needs to atone 

after all you ve put her through  

How do you think the Mother 

Above first came to us  

How did men and women 

first come to feel the 

Mother s presence  

It was through their own mothers. 

There s a great deal of falsehood 

in Cersei. You know that. 

But when she speaks of you  the 

Mother s love outshines it all. 

Her love for you is more real 

than anything else in this world 

because it doesn t come from this world. 

But you know that. 

You ve felt it. 

You ve seen her when she talks to you. 

Yes. 

It s a great gift. 

One I never had. 

Envy. 

One more thing for me to atone for. 

Your Grace  do you... may I  

Do you mind  

It s my knees. 

Of course. 

When your mother made 

her walk of atonement  

she did it to get back to you. 

I still don t understand 

why you want to put her 

through any more than 

she s already endured. 

It s not what I want. 

It s what the gods want. 

They make their will known 

to us and it s up to us 

to either accept or reject it. 

Please. 

If we re to be just and good  

then we accept it  all 

of us  even kings. 

A true leader avails himself 

of the wisest counsel he can. 

And no one is wiser than the gods. 

My grandfather once 

said something similar. 

Except for the part about the gods. 

The gods worked through him 

whether he knew it or not. 

As they work through your mother. 

There s so much good in all of us. 

The best we can do is to help 

each other bring it out. 

Who are you  

No one. 

Who were you before you came here  

Arya Stark. 

Tell me about Arya Stark s family. 

Her father was Eddard Stark. 

Her mother was Catelyn Stark. 

She had one sister  Sansa  

and four brothers. 

Three brothers. 

Robb  Bran  Rickon. 

And a half brother Jon. 

And where are they now  

They may be dead for all a girl knows. 

Tell me about the Hound. 

Also dead. 

Arya Stark left him to die. 

He was on her list. 

He was not on her list anymore. 

She had taken him off it. 

Why  Didn t she want 

him dead any longer  

She did and she did not. 

She sounds confused. 

Yes  she was. 

Who else was on Arya 

Stark s funny little list  

Cersei Lannister. 

Gregor Clegane. 

Walder Frey. 

That s a short list. 

That can t be everyone you want to kill. 

Are you sure you re not 

forgetting someone  

Which name would you 

like a girl to speak  

If a girl tells me her name  

I will give her eyes back. 

A girl has no name. 

Come. 

If a girl is truly no one  

she has nothing to fear. 

Who are you  

No one. 

The Umbers are a famously loyal house. 

Famously loyal to the Starks. 

And you  Lord Karstark. 

Your people share blood with 

the Starks  don t they  

But here we are. Times change. 

When my father became 

Warden of the North  

your house refused to 

pledge their banners. 

Your father was a cunt. 

My beloved father  the Warden... 

Your father was a cunt and 

that s why you killed him. 

I might have done the same to my father 

if he hadn t have done me the 

favor of dying on his own. 

My father was poisoned by our enemies. 

Why have you come to 

Winterfell  Lord Umber  

The bastard Jon Snow led an army 

of wildlings past the Wall. 

We re farther north than 

any of you fuckers. 

Wildlings come down  we always 

have to fight them first. 

I like fighting wildlings. 

Been doing it all my life. 

But there are too many of them 

for us to beat back alone. 

So now you ve come seeking help  

We need to help each other. 

The colder it gets  the farther 

south those goat fuckers will roam. 

Won t take them long to get here. 

You think a horde of wildlings 

can take Winterfell  

If they get Jon Snow 

leading them  maybe. 

He knows this place 

better than we ever will. 

Pledge your banners to House Bolton. 

Swear loyalty to me as 

Warden of the North 

and we will fight together 

to destroy the bastard 

and all his wildling friends. 

I m not kissing your fucking hand. 

Traditionally a bannerman 

kneels before his lord. 

I m not doing that either. 

Why would I trust a man who 

won t honor tradition  

Your father honored tradition. 

Knelt for Robb Stark. 

Called him King of the North. 

Was Robb Stark right 

to trust your father  

Then it appears we re 

at a bit of an impasse. 

Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. 

I ve got a gift for you. 

A girl  I hope. I prefer redheads. 

A girl  aye. 

A wild one. 

I like them wild. 

And the boy  nice and young. 

The way Karstark likes them. 

Who s this  

Rickon Stark. 

How do I know that s Rickon Stark  

Welcome home  Lord Stark. 

It s time. 

If you have any last 

words  now is the time. 

You shouldn t be alive. 

It s not right. 

Neither was killing me. 

My mother s still 

living at White Harbor. 

Could you write her  

Tell her I died fighting the wildlings. 

I had a choice  Lord Commander. 

Betray you or betray the Night s Watch. 

You brought an army of 

wildlings into our lands. 

An army of murderers and raiders. 

If I had to do it all over 

knowing where I d end up  

I pray I d make the right choice again. 

I m sure you would  Ser Alliser. 

I fought  I lost. 

Now I rest. 

But you  Lord Snow  

you ll be fighting 

their battles forever. 

We should burn the bodies. 

You should. 

What do you want me to do with this  

Wear it. 

Burn it. 

Whatever you want. 

You have Castle Black. 

My watch is ended. 

milka 

      Carpe Diem       

Look at me. 

Look at me  

Do you remember 

me now  boy  eh  

Remember me  

There s a bright boy. 

You ll be coming 

with me  boy  

and you ll be keeping 

your mouth shut. 

  Keep your mouth shut  boy. 

  I m not a boy  

You re not a  i smart  i  boy  

is that what you re trying to say  

Do you want 

to live  boy   

North  boy  

we re going north. 

It had three eyes. 

It told me to come 

with him  so I did. 

We went down into the crypts 

and my father was there. 

Your father s not 

down there  little lord. 

Not for many years yet. 

You re afraid   

just like Hodor. 

I m not afraid of some hole 

in the ground. 

You ve lived beyond the Wall. 

What are you scared of  

I m a crippled boy 

and I m willing to go. 

That s my grandfather 

Lord Rickard. 

He was burned alive 

by the Mad King Aerys. 

That s Lyanna  

my father s sister. 

 i King Robert was  i  

 i supposed to marry her   i  

 i but Rhaegar Targaryen  i  

 i kidnapped her.  i  

 i Robert started a war  i  

 i to win her back.  i  

 i He killed Rhaegar   i  

 i but she died anyway.  i  

That s where 

I saw father. 

You see  

He s not here. 

  i Here  Shaggydog.  i  

 Rickon  

That beast 

is supposed to be 

chained in the kennels  

  He doesn t like chains. 

  What are you doing down here  

  Come back up with us. 

  No  I came to see father. 

How many times have I told you  

He s in King s Landing 

with Sansa and Arya. 

He was down here. 

I saw him. 

Saw him when  

 i Last night   i  

when I was sleeping. 

Here  Shaggydog. 

You both miss him. 

It s only natural 

he should be in your thoughts 

and dreams  

but that doesn t mean that

You ve ruined your sword. 

Shh shh.

  I ll kill them all   

  Every one of them. 

I will kill them all.

They have your sisters. 

We have to get 

the girls back. 

And then we will 

kill them all.

did all the rest.     

Very amusing. 

Isn t it a funny song  

 i Thank you  i  

 i for your rendition.  i  

I imagine it was even better 

received at that tavern. 

I m so sorry  

Your Grace. 

I ll never sing it again  

I swear. 

Tell me  

which do you favor  

 i Your fingers  i  

 i or your tongue   i  

Your Grace  

Fingers 

or your tongue  

If you got to keep one  

which would it be  

I   I   

or I could just 

cut your throat. 

Every man needs hands  

Your Grace. 

Good. 

  Tongue it is. 

  Your Grace  please. 

I won t sing   

Your Grace. 

Ser Ilyn  

who better than you 

  to carry out the sentence  

  I beg you  

Please no. 

 i No   i  

Your Grace  please. 

I beg you  I will never sing again  

  I m done for the day. 

   i No oooo   i  

I ll leave the rest 

of the matters to you  mother. 

Your Grace  please  

You look quite nice. 

Thank you  My Lord. 

 Your Grace.  

I m King now. 

 i Stop ppp   i  

 i No   i  

Walk with me. 

I want to show you something. 

Do as you re bid  child. 

...And as soon as you ve had 

your blood  I ll put a son in you. 

Mother says that 

shouldn t be long. 

No  please no  

This one s your father. 

This one here. 

Look at it and see 

what happens to traitors. 

  You promised to be merciful. 

  I was. 

I gave him 

a clean death. 

Look at him. 

Please let me go home. 

I won t do any treason  I swear. 

Mother says I m still to marry you. 

So you ll stay here 

and obey. 

Look at him  

 i Well   i  

How long 

do I have to look  

As long as it pleases me. 

Do you want 

to see the rest  

If it please Your Grace. 

That s your Septa there. 

 i I ll tell you what   i  

I m going to give you 

a present. 

After I raise my armies 

and kill your traitor brother  

I m going to give you 

his head as well. 

Or maybe he ll 

give me yours. 

My mother tells me a King 

should never strike his lady. 

Ser Meryn. 

Here  girl. 

Will you obey now  

Or do you need 

another lesson  

I ll look for you 

in court. 

Save yourself 

some pain  girl. 

Give him what he wants. 

You ll be 

needing that again. 

The proper course 

is clear  

Pledge fealty to King Renly 

and move south 

to join our forces 

with his. 

 i Renly is not the King.  i  

You cannot mean 

to hold to Joffrey  My Lord. 

He put your father 

to death. 

That doesn t 

make Renly King. 

He s Robert s 

 i youngest  i  brother. 

If Bran can t be Lord 

of Winterfell before me  

 i Renly can t be King  i  

 i before Stannis.  i  

Do you mean to declare us 

for Stannis  

  Renly is not right  

  My Lords. 

If we put ourselves 

behind Stannis   

My Lords  

Here is what I say 

to these two Kings   

Renly Baratheon 

is nothing to me  

nor Stannis neither. 

Why should they rule 

over me and mine 

from some flowery seat 

in the South  

 i What do they know of the Wall  i  

 i or the Wolfswood   i  

Even their Gods 

are wrong  

Why shouldn t we rule 

ourselves again  

It was the Dragons 

we bowed to 

and now the Dragons 

are dead  

There sits the only King 

I mean to bend 

my knee to   

the King 

in the North  

I ll have peace 

on those terms. 

 i They can keep  i  

 i their Red Castle  i  

and their Iron Chair too. 

The King 

in the North  

Am I your brother  

now and always  

Now and always. 

My sword is yours  

in victory and defeat 

from this day 

until my last day. 

The King 

in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King 

in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King 

in the North  

The King in the North  

The King 

in the North  

 i The King in the North   i  

 i The King in the North   i  

 i The King in the North   i  

  Lady Stark. 

  I want to see him. 

Now  

Leave us. 

You look lovely 

tonight  Lady Stark. 

 i Widowhood becomes you.  i  

Your bed must be lonely. 

Is that why you came  

 i I m not at my best   i  

but I think I could 

be of service. 

You slip out of that gown 

and we ll see if I m up to it. 

Oh  I do like 

a violent woman. 

I will kill you 

tonight  Ser  

pack your head in a box 

and send it to your sister. 

 i Let me show you how    i  

hit me again  

over the ear. 

And again and again. 

You re stronger than you look   

it shouldn t take long. 

That is what you want 

the world to believe  

isn t it  

That you don t fear death. 

But I don t  My Lady. 

The dark is coming for all of us. 

Why cry about it  

Because you are going 

to the deepest 

of the Seven Hells  

if the Gods are just. 

What Gods are those  

The trees your husband 

prayed to  

 i Where were the trees when his  i  

 i head was getting chopped off   i  

If your Gods are real 

and if they are just  

why is the world 

so full of injustice  

Because of men like you. 

There are no men like me. 

Only me. 

My son Bran. 

How did he come to fall 

from that tower  

I pushed him 

out the window. 

Why  

I hoped the fall 

would kill him. 

Why  

You should get some sleep. 

It s going to be 

a long war. 

I can t believe 

we re actually at war. 

Was it this exciting last time  

when you were young  

What does it say  

Have we captured 

Robb Stark yet  

  What s our next move  

  Stop talking. 

Get back into bed. 

They have my son. 

The Stark boy appears 

to be less green than we d hoped. 

I ve heard his wolf killed a doze 

men and as many horses. 

Is it true about 

Stannis and Renly  

Both Baratheon brothers 

have taken up against us. 

Jaime captured  

his armies scattered... 

It s a catastrophe. 

Perhaps we should 

sue for peace. 

There s your peace. 

Joffrey saw to that when h 

decided to remove Ned Stark s head. 

 i You ll have an easier time  i  

 i drinking from that cup  i  

 i than you will bringing Robb Stark  i  

 i to the table now.  i  

He s winning... 

in case you 

hadn t noticed. 

I m told we still 

have his sisters. 

The first order of business 

is ransoming Ser Jaime. 

No truces. 

We can t afford to look weak. 

 i We should march  i  

 i on them at once.  i  

 i First we must return  i  

 i to Casterly Rock to raise    i  

They have my son  

Get out  all of you. 

Not you. 

You were right 

about Eddard Stark. 

If he were alive  

we could have used him 

to broker a peace 

with Winterfell and Riverrun  

which would have 

given us more time 

to deal with Robert s brothers. 

But now... 

Madness   

madness and stupidity. 

I always thought 

you were a stunted fool. 

Perhaps I was wrong. 

Half wrong. 

I m new to strategy  but   

unless we want to be 

surrounded by three armies  

 i it appears we can t  i  

 i stay here.  i  

No one will stay here. 

Ser Gregor will head out 

with  riders 

and set the Riverland on fire 

from God s Eye to the Red Fork. 

The rest of us will 

regroup at Harrenhal. 

And you will go 

to King s Landing. 

And do what  

Rule  

You will serve as Hand 

of the King in my stead. 

You will bring that boy King to heel 

and his mother too  if needs be. 

And if you get so much as a whiff 

of treason from any of the rest  

  Baelish  Varys  Pycelle   

  Heads  spikes  walls. 

Why not my Uncle  

Why not anyone  

Why me  

You re my son. 

Oh  one more thing  

You will not take 

the whore to court. 

Do you understand  

Ser Jorah  

Gently gently. 

My son... 

Where is he  

I want him. 

Where is he  

The boy did not live. 

  Tell me. 

  What is there to tell  

How did my son die   

He never lived  

My Princess. 

The women say... 

What do the women say  

  They say the child was   

   i Monstrous   i  

twisted. 

I pulled him out 

myself. 

He was scaled 

like a lizard  

 i blind  with leather wings  i  

 i like the wings of a bat.  i  

When I touched him 

the skin fell from his bones. 

Inside he was 

full of graveworms. 

I warned you that only death 

can pay for life. 

You knew the price. 

Where is Khal Drogo  

Show him to me. 

Show me what I bought 

with my son s life. 

As you command  lady. 

Come. 

I will take you 

to him. 

  Time enough for that later   

  I want to see him now. 

The Khalasar is gone. 

A Khal who cannot ride 

is no Khal. 

The Dothraki 

follow only the strong. 

I m sorry  My Princess. 

Drogo  

Why is he out here alone  

He seems to like 

the warmth  Princess. 

 i He lives.  i  

 i You asked for life   i  

 i you paid for life.  i  

This is not life. 

When will he be as he was  

When the sun rises in the west  

sets in the east 

 i when the seas go dry.  i  

When the mountains blow 

in the wind like leaves. 

Leave us. 

I don t want you alone 

with this sorceress. 

I have nothing more 

to fear from this woman. 

Go. 

You knew what I was buying 

and you knew the price. 

It was wrong of them 

to burn my temple. 

   i It angered the Great Shepherd.  i  

  This is not God s work. 

  My child was innocent. 

  Innocent  

He would have been the stallion 

who mounts the world. 

Now he will burn no cities. 

Now his Khalasar will trample 

no nations into dust. 

I spoke for you. 

I saved you. 

Saved me  

Three of those riders 

had already 

raped me before 

you saved me  girl. 

I saw my God s house burn  

there where I had healed men 

and women beyond counting. 

In the streets 

I saw piles of heads   

the head of the Baker 

who makes my bread  

the head of a young boy 

that I had cured of fever 

just three moons past. 

So tell me again 

exactly what it was 

that you saved. 

Your life. 

Hmph. 

Why don t you take 

a look at your Khal... 

Then you will see 

exactly what life is worth 

when all the rest has gone. 

You can t  

Get out of my way  Sam. 

They ll put out the word. 

They ll send out ravens. 

People will come after you. 

Do you know what happens 

to deserters  

Better than you do. 

What are you going to do  

I m gonna find my brother 

and put a sword through 

King Joffrey s throat. 

You can t leave us now. 

We need you here. 

  Move. 

  I won t let you go. 

  Move. 

  No. 

Hyah  

Hand of the King  

So it would seem. 

And your father said you couldn t take 

anyone with you to King s Landing. 

No  he said I couldn t take  i you  i  

with me to King s Landing. 

He was very specific 

on that point. 

He knew my name  

What  

He said   Don t bring Shae 

with you to King s Landing   

I believe he used 

the word  whore.  

Are you ashamed of me  

Are you afraid that I m dancing 

around the court with my tits out  

I m funny now  

I m Shae the funny whore. 

My father s probably the most 

powerful man in the country. 

Certainly the richest. 

 i He has all Seven Kingdoms  i  

 i in his pockets.  i  

Everyone everywhere 

always has to do exactly 

what my father says. 

He s always been a cunt. 

I believe the ladies 

of the court 

 i could learn a great deal  i  

 i from a girl like you.  i  

Why don t you 

come with me  

 i be the Hand s lady   i  

Because the King needs 

a Hand and the Hand   

I know what 

a Hand needs. 

  Ghost  

   i Hyah   i  

  Hyah. 

  Hyah  

Hyah. 

 i Samwell   i  

 i   Is he dead   i  

 i   No  he s not dead.  i  

 i Did we get him   i  

 i Come on  help me  i  

 i get him up.  i  

Lucky you ve got 

plenty of padding. 

We re taking you back 

to where you belong. 

  I belong with my brother. 

  But we re your brothers now. 

They ll kill you if they find out 

you ve gone. 

They ll kill you if they know 

you came after me. 

  Go back. 

  Sam told us everything. 

   i We re sorry about your father.  i  

  But it doesn t matter. 

You took the oath. 

You can t leave. 

  I have to. 

  You can t. 

  You said the words. 

  I don t care about   

 Hear my words and bear 

witness to my vow...  

To hell with all of you. 

 Night gathers and now 

my Watch begins. 

It shall not end 

until my death. 

I shall live and die 

at my post.  

 I am the sword 

in the darkness...  

 ...The Watcher on the Walls  

the shield that guards 

the realms of men. 

I pledge my life and honor 

to the Night s Watch  

for this night 

and all nights to come.  

When the sun 

rises in the west 

and sets in the east... 

Then you shall return 

to me  my sun and stars. 

Kings  

Oh  I can tell you all 

there is to know about Kings. 

The thing you need to 

understand about Kings is... 

For the past  years  

I ve known   

truly known more Kings 

than any man alive. 

They re complicated men  

but I know how to serve them. 

Yes. 

And keep on serving them. 

Aerys Targaryen... 

of all the thousand thousand 

maladies the Gods visit on us  

madness is the worst. 

He was a good man  

such a charmer. 

To watch him melt away 

before my eyes  

consumed by dreams 

of fire and blood... 

Robert Baratheon 

was an entirely different animal   

powerful man  

a great warrior   

but alas  

winning a Kingdom 

and ruling a Kingdom 

are rather different things. 

They say that 

if a man goes through life 

with his battle visor down  

he can often be blind 

to the enemies at his side. 

Now I serve his son 

King Joffrey  

may the Gods 

bless his reign. 

He is a capable young man   

strong military mind. 

Stern... 

But sternness in defense 

of the realm is no vice. 

It s far too soon to know what 

manner of King he will be  

but I sense 

true greatness on the horizon 

for our new King. 

True greatness. 

So what s the thing  

What thing  

About Kings. 

You said   the thing you need 

to understand about Kings...  

What  Things  

What  

When you started  you   

never mind. 

Let me see you 

out  my dear. 

  It s all right. No need. 

   i Yes yes.  i  

Till the next time. 

Right. 

When you imagine yourself up 

there  how do you look  

Does the crown fit  

Do all the lords and ladies 

simper and bow  the ones who 

sneered at you for years  

It s hard for them to simper 

and bow without heads. 

A man with great ambition 

and no morals   

I wouldn t 

bet against you. 

And what would you do  

my friend  

if you found yourself 

sitting up there  

I must be one of the few men 

in this city 

who doesn t 

want to be King. 

You must be one 

of the few men in the city 

who isn t a man. 

Oh  you can do 

better than that. 

When they castrated you  did they 

take the pillar with the stones  

  I ve always wondered. 

  Have you  

Do you spend a lot of time wondering 

what s between my legs  

I picture a gash 

like a woman s. 

Is that about right  

I am flattered  of course  

to be pictured at all. 

Must be strange for you  

even after all these years   

a man from another land  

despised by most  

feared by all   

am I  

That is good to know. 

Do you lie awake at night 

fearing my gash  

But you carry on  

whispering in one King s ear 

and then the next. 

I admire you. 

And I admire you  

Lord Baelish. 

A grasper from a minor house 

with a major talent 

 i for befriending  i  

 i powerful men    i  

and women. 

A useful talent  

I m sure you d agree. 

So here we stand... 

In mutual admiration 

and respect. 

Playing our roles. 

Serving a new King. 

Long may he reign. 

  My King. 

  My King. 

My Lords. 

Shall we begin  

 i You re Arry now  hear me   i  

Arry the orphan boy. 

No one asks an orphan 

too many questions 

 cause nobody gives 

three shits. 

What s your name  

  Arry. 

  Ah. 

We have a long way 

to travel and in bad company. 

I have  this time  

men and boys all 

bound for the Wall. 

Your Lord father gave me 

the pick of the dungeons 

and I didn t find 

no little lordlings down there. 

This lot  half of them would 

turn you over to the King 

quick as spit for a pardon. 

And the other half 

would do the same  

except they d 

rape you first. 

So keep to yourself   

and when you piss  

do it in the woods alone. 

You stay 

with this lot  boy. 

And stay   

or I ll lock you in the back of 

the wagon with these three. 

Watch yourself  

midget. 

He s got a sword  

this one. 

What s a gutter rat 

like you doing with a sword  

  Maybe he s a little squire. 

  He ain t no squire. Look at him. 

He looks like a girl. 

I bet he stole 

that sword. 

Let s have a look. 

I could use me 

a sword like that. 

   i Take it off him.  i  

  Give it here  midget. 

Look at him  

You d better give 

Hot Pie the sword. 

I ve seen him 

kick a boy to death. 

I knocked him down 

and I kicked him in the balls 

and I kept kicking him 

until he was dead. 

I kicked him 

all to pieces. 

  You better give me that sword  

  You want it  

I ll give it to you. 

I already killed 

one fat boy. 

I bet you never 

killed anyone. 

I bet you re a liar. 

But I m not. 

I m good at killing 

fat boys. 

I like killing fat boys. 

Oh  you like picking 

on the little ones  do you  

You know  I ve been hammering 

an anvil these past  years. 

When I hit 

that steel  it sings. 

Are you gonna sing 

when I hit you  

This is 

castle forged steel. 

Where d you steal it  

  It was a gift. 

  It don t matter now. 

Where we re going  

they don t care what you ve done. 

They ve got rapers  

pickpockets  highwaymen   

murderers. 

  Which are you  

  Armorer s apprentice. 

But my master 

got sick of me  

so here I am. 

 i Come on  you sorry  i  

 i sons of whores   i  

It s a thousand leagues 

from here to the Wall 

and winter is coming  

Ham. 

How many days in a row 

must a man be 

expected to start 

his day with ham  

Bring me some beer 

at least. 

You look exhausted. 

Was your moonlight ride 

that tiring  

Don t look so terrified. 

If we beheaded everyone 

that ran away for the night  

only ghosts 

would guard the Wall. 

At least you weren t 

whoring in Mole s Town. 

Honor made you leave  

honor brought you back. 

My friends 

brought me back. 

I didn t say 

it was your honor. 

They killed my father. 

And you re going to bring him 

back to life  are you  

No  Good. 

We ve had enough 

of that sort of thing. 

Beyond the Wall  

the rangers are 

reporting whole villages 

abandoned. 

At night they see fires 

blazing in the mountains 

from dusk until dawn. 

A captured wildling swears their tribes 

are uniting in some secret stronghold  

 i to what ends  i  

 i the Gods only know.  i  

Outside Eastwatch 

Cotter Pyke s men discovered four 

blue eyed corpses. 

Unlike us  they were wise enough 

to burn them. 

Do you think 

your brother s war 

is more important 

than ours  

  No. 

  When dead men and worse 

come hunting for us in the night  

do you think it matters 

 i who sits  i  

 i on the Iron Throne   i  

  No. 

  Good. 

Because I want you 

and your wolf with us 

when we ride out 

beyond the Wall tomorrow. 

Beyond the Wall  

I ll not sit meekly by 

and wait for the snows. 

 i I mean to find out  i  

 i what s happening.  i  

 i The Night s Watch will  i  

 i ride in force  i  

 i against the wildlings   i  

 i the White Walkers  i  

 i and whatever else  i  

 i is out there.  i  

 i And we will find Benjen Stark   i  

 i alive or dead.  i  

 i I will command them  i  

 i myself.  i  

 i So I ll only ask you once   i  

 i Lord Snow...  i  

 i Move out   i  

 i ...Are you a brother  i  

 i of the Night s Watch  i  

 i or a bastard boy  i  

 i who wants to play at war   i  

Drogo will have no use for 

dragon eggs in the Night Lands. 

Sell them. You can return 

to the Free Cities 

and live as a wealthy woman 

for all your days. 

They were not 

given to me to sell. 

Khaleesi  My Queen  

I vow to serve you  

obey you  

to die for you 

if need be  

but let him go  

Khaleesi. 

I know what you intend. 

Do not. 

I must. 

You don t understand   

don t ask me to stand aside 

as you climb on that pyre. 

I won t watch you burn. 

Is that what you fear  

You will be my Khalasar. 

I see the faces of slaves. 

I free you. 

Take off your collars. Go if yo 

wish  no one will stop you. 

But if you stay  

it will be as 

brothers and sisters  

 i as husbands and wives.  i  

Ser Jorah  bind this woman 

to the pyre. 

You swore to obey me. 

I am Daenerys Stormborn 

of House Targaryen 

of the blood of Old Valyria. 

I am the Dragon s daughter. 

And I swear to you 

that those who would harm you 

will die screaming. 

You will not 

hear me scream. 

I will. 

But it is not 

your screams I want. 

Only your life. 

Blood of my blood. 

 i   Look out   i  

 i   Fire  Fire  

A band of  

men  maybe less. 

They were in and out 

before anyone spotted them. 

Burnt our food stores 

to the ground  

all our siege weapons destroyed. 

  Dozens of tents were   

  Horses  

We re still getting a count  

but hundreds are dead. 

 men rode into our camp without a 

single guard sounding the alarm  

The northerners know more about 

their land than we ever will. 

Put last night s guards 

in chains. 

Either they fell asleep or 

they conspired with the enemy. 

  Find out the truth and then hang them. 

  Your Grace. 

Unless there s a thaw  we can t 

press forward to Winterfell 

and we don t have enough food 

to get us back to Castle Black. 

We re not returning 

to Castle Black. 

Forgive me  Your Grace  I never claimed 

to be an expert in military matters  

but if we can t march forward 

and we won t march back... 

Have the dead horses 

butchered for meat. 

 i Halt  

 i  Halt  

 i  There it is  

Open the gates. 

It was a failure. 

It wasn t. 

I went to save them. 

I failed. 

You didn t fail him. 

Or him. 

 i Or her. 

Every one of them is alive 

because of you and no one else. 

I don t think that 

fact s lost on them. 

You have a good heart  Jon Snow. 

It ll get us all killed. 

Out of my way. 

You sent for me  Your Grace  

Find some healthy horses and 

a few knights to guard you. 

I m sending you back 

to Castle Black. 

Tell the Lord Commander 

his king commands him 

to send food  supplies  

fresh horses. 

In return  

when I take the throne  

I ll make sure the Night s Watch 

has all the men it requires. 

He can guard all  castles 

on the Wall if he so wishes. 

Your Grace  

you named me your Hand. 

Yes. 

The King s Hand should 

never abandon the king  

especially in time of war. 

You re not abandoning me. 

You re obeying a command. 

A boy with a scroll 

could deliver this message. 

And if Jon Snow refuses 

the boy with the scroll  

what does the boy say  

I didn t name you Hand for your 

expertise in military matters. 

Ride for Castle Black. 

Don t come back empty handed. 

Your Grace  perhaps Queen Selyse 

and Princess Shireen 

could accompany me. 

My family stays with me. 

At least let me take Shireen. 

 i A siege is no place  i  

 i for a little girl. 

My family stays with me. 

What s this one now  

 The Dance of Dragons  

A True Telling  

by Grand Maester Munkun. 

Now that sounds 

like a proper story. 

Ser Byron Swann wanted 

to kill the dragon Vhagar. 

He polished his shield for a week 

so that it was like a mirror. 

And he crouched behind it 

and crept forward  

hoping the dragon would 

only see its own reflection. 

But the dragon saw a dumb man 

holding a mirrored shield. 

And burnt him to a crisp. 

Thus ending 

the dragon slaying career 

of Ser Byron Swann. 

I made you something  Princess. 

Do you like it  

He s beautiful. 

  Thank you. 

  You re very welcome. 

Will you make me a doe  too  

So that he can have company  

Of course I will. 

But why am I getting a present  

Because you deserve it. 

My son was always on me  

trying to teach me to read. 

Gods  I was stubborn about it. 

Made it this far 

without reading. 

Seemed to me I could 

make it to the grave. 

Wish I d listened to him. 

This is my own poor way 

of saying thank you. 

For teaching me 

to be a grown up. 

I ll be gone for a 

few days  Princess. 

I want to hear all about  The 

Dance of Dragons  when I m back. 

You ll read it yourself. 

Prince Doran. 

Forgive us. 

We started without you. 

 i Please  sit. 

Princess Myrcella. 

Uncle. 

What a lovely dress. 

  You don t like it  

  You must be cold. 

Not at all. The Dornish 

climate agrees with me. 

Prince Trystane. 

How s your jaw  

A fleabite. 

What are you doing in Dorne  

Looking after the safety of my 

niece  the Princess Myrcella. 

And rather than send a raven 

or speak to me directly  

you decided to enter 

my country in secret 

and abduct our guest by force  

We received 

a threatening message. 

The princess s necklace 

in the jaws of a viper. 

That necklace 

was stolen from my room. 

Oh  excellent. 

A last meal before 

the beheading  

Oh  I can t behead you. 

Many in Dorne want war. 

But I ve seen war. 

I ve seen the bodies 

piled on the battlefields. 

I ve seen the orphans 

starving in the cities. 

I don t want to lead 

my people into that hell. 

No  you want to break bread 

with the Lannisters. 

And that is precisely 

what we are doing. 

Let us drink to Tommen  

the First of His Name  

 i King of the Andals  i  

 i and the First Men  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. 

King Tommen insists 

on his sister s return 

to the capital  

I m afraid he does. 

I cannot disobey 

my king s command. 

She will return with you 

to King s Landing. 

 i And my son Prince Trystane  i  

 i will accompany you both. 

If the alliance between the Iron 

Throne and Dorne is to continue  

their engagement must stand. 

I accept. 

One more thing. 

My brother was named 

to the small council 

before his death. 

Your father understood 

the importance 

 i of keeping Dorne in the fold. 

With Oberyn gone  Trystane will take 

his place on the small council. 

You have my word. 

The word of a kingslayer. 

No wonder you can t stand. 

You have no spine. 

You are mother 

to four of my nieces  

girls I love very much. 

For their sake  I hope you 

live a long and happy life. 

Speak to me that way 

again  and you won t. 

May I inquire as to the 

fate of my man Bronn  

Tell me  Ser Jaime  

in King s Landing  

how do they punish a commoner 

who strikes a prince  

He said it was just a fleabite. 

The fault is mine. 

Bronn is merely a soldier 

following my orders. 

If anyone should 

be punished  it s me. 

Prince Trystane must learn 

judgment if he is to rule one day. 

I ll let him decide. 

I have learned the value 

of mercy from my father. 

   i  I ll set your man free.  i  

  You re a good man. 

On one condition. 

Why do we play  

I m better than you. 

I ll always be better than you. 

Have I ever missed once  

I don t think I have. 

I can t recall. 

You must love humiliation. 

Or pain. 

Which do you love most  

humiliation or pain  

That one hurt  didn t it  

You going to cry  

Give up  little sister. 

  You re going to miss. 

  Oh  I never miss. 

You will. 

You re thinking too much. 

Now you re nervous. 

What if she s right  

  Luck. 

  Now it s my turn. 

You re too slow. 

You ve always been too slow. 

Am I gonna be happy 

at the end of this walk  

You ll find out very soon. 

Say it one more time  handsome. 

Who am I  

The most beautiful 

woman in the world. 

And that s the truth. 

Slut. 

Prince Doran  

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. 

I didn t realize there were 

knights of the Blackwater. 

Only the one. 

I believe you ve already 

met Prince Trystane. 

Prince. 

Sorry about the other day. 

 i Prince Trystane 

here is a man of mercy. 

He s agreed to grant 

you your freedom. 

I m glad to hear it. 

Pie looks good. 

There was one condition. 

Perhaps some soup instead. 

Oysters  clams  and cockles. 

Oysters  clams  and cockles. 

Oysters  clams  and cockles. 

Oysters  clams  

and cock   

How much for your little clam  

Oysters  clams  and cockles. 

Oysters  clams  and cockles. 

Come on. 

 i Some oysters  girl  

 i I m talking to you. 

Is  uh... 

  Girl  

 i    Tie her up  

 i Are you deaf  Girl  

Girl  

My lord. 

 i My lord. 

 i Lord Tyrell. 

On behalf of the Iron Bank  

may I be the first 

to welcome you 

to the Free City of Braavos. 

I hope your journey 

was trouble free. 

A bit of chop the last few days. 

Nothing too awful. 

Good to see the old chap 

still guarding the harbor. 

And how goes the 

harvest in the Reach  

Ah  the vintners say 

this might be 

the best year for red 

grapes in half a century. 

 i If we come to a 

satisfactory arrangement  

I ll be sure to send a cask of 

the Arbor s finest your way. 

I m afraid I don t partake. 

Oh. 

Some consider usury 

distasteful  dishonorable. 

Pure nonsense  of course. 

I m glad we see eye to 

eye on this matter. 

 i Did you know that at 

one point Maegor the third 

tried to outlaw it 

in the Seven Kingdoms  

Wanted to arrest anyone 

caught charging interest 

 i and cut off both their hands. 

Most unfortunate 

for the glovers. 

 i If a man charges 

no interest on a loan  

 i then he has nothing to gain  i  

 i and everything to lose  

 i so why chance it  

 i Whereas the promise of reward 

 i makes a man willing to gamble. 

We are not gamblers here at 

the Iron Bank  Lord Tyrell. 

You are the world s 

best gamblers. 

And all those bets 

you won built this. 

We should celebrate. 

I m afraid I still have 

a good deal of work to do. 

 i Oh  nonsense. Work s over. 

Do you sing  

  I don t have that gift. 

  Oh  it s not a gift. 

It s a skill. 

Anyone can learn it. 

 So give me a kiss 

by the Long Canal  

 And give me two kisses 

in Salty Town  

 For we re going 

to die tomorrow  

 The bareheaded beggar  

the king with his crown...  

 i Thought that old shit 

would never stop singing. 

Wasn t bad  though. 

The Tyrells can all rot in hell. 

Treasonous cunts. 

They were going to make 

that boy fucker Renly king. 

This is the place  lads. 

The sleekest little minks 

in Braavos. 

  You buying  

  Oh  I m buying. 

But I never was good at sharing. 

Sell your fish somewhere else. 

Oh  let her in  Brusco. 

I m hungry. 

Come here  sweetness. 

They say oysters 

get the juices flowing. 

We ll take half a dozen. 

Three coppers. 

Here s a silver because 

the lady likes you. 

Too old. 

Brea. 

Too old. 

 i I have just the one. 

Anara. 

 i Our most expensive girl. 

 i But well worth it  I assure you. 

Too old. 

Do you have what I want or not  

Of course. 

Of course. 

These fresh  

Come on  the lads are hungry. 

Nothing better for your 

cockstand than fresh oysters. 

 i   Here. Thank you.  i  

 i   I ll have one. 

 i Any vinegar  

Who let this girl in  

Shoo  Shoo  

Good. 

I ll tell you when we re done. 

You ll have a fresh one 

for me tomorrow  

Of course. 

 i I ll have 

you whipped  girl. 

Go  go on. 

Out  out  go. 

Valar morghulis. 

Valar morghulis. 

And  

The thin man 

wasn t hungry today. 

Perhaps that is why 

a man is thin. 

Tomorrow. 

Tomorrow. 

A girl has work to do. 

Your rebellion is over. 

You can swear your 

allegiance to me now... 

or you can die. 

I believe in second chances. 

I don t believe 

in third chances. 

You write like 

a seven year old. 

Your maester kindly agreed 

to copy it over for me. 

 i He didn t try to make you pay  

Mm mmm. 

Maybe he s changed. 

The queen will be thrilled to know 

you re bringing her daughter home. 

She will. 

You love her very much  

don t you  

Of course  she s my niece. 

I wasn t talking about her. 

You think I disapprove  

Why  

Because people disapprove of that 

sort of thing where you are from  

They disapproved of Oberyn 

and me where you are from. 

Here no one blinked an eye. 

 years ago  

no one would have 

blinked an eye at you 

if you d been named Targaryen. 

It s always changing  who we re 

supposed to love and who we re not. 

The only thing 

that stays the same 

is that we want who we want. 

I know your daughter had no 

part in the terrible thing 

that happened to the man I love. 

Perhaps even you 

are innocent of that. 

Father. 

Aren t you cold  

No. What are you reading  

   The Dance of Dragons.  

  What s it about  

It s the story of the fight 

between Rhaenyra Targaryen 

and her half brother Aegon for 

control over the Seven Kingdoms. 

Both of them thought they 

belonged on the Iron Throne. 

When people started declaring 

for one of them or the other  

their fight divided 

the kingdoms in two. 

Brothers fought brothers  

dragons fought dragons. 

By the time it was over  

thousands were dead. 

And it was a disaster 

for the Targaryens as well. 

They never truly recovered. 

 The Dance of Dragons.  

Why is that a dance  

It s just what they call it. 

Hmm  doesn t make much sense. 

I think it s poetic. 

If you had to choose 

between Rhaenyra and Aegon... 

who would you have chosen  

I wouldn t have chosen either. 

It s all the choosing sides that 

made everything so horrible. 

Sometimes a person 

has to choose. 

Sometimes the world 

forces his hand. 

If a man knows what he is... 

and remains true to himself... 

the choice is no choice at all. 

He must fulfill his destiny... 

and become 

who he is meant to be. 

However much he may hate it. 

It s all right  Father. 

You don t even know 

what I m talking about. 

It doesn t matter. 

I want to help you. 

Is there any way I can help  

Yes  there is. 

Good. I want to. 

I m the Princess Shireen 

of House Baratheon. 

And I m your daughter. 

Forgive me. 

Where s my father  

I want to see my father. 

It will all be over 

soon  Princess. 

No. 

Where s my father  

No  you can t do this. 

Father  where are you  

 i Please  let me see my father. 

 i Father  where are you   i  

 i Don t let her do this. 

Please let go  

 i Let me see my father   i  

 i Where are you  Please  

  It s what the Lord wants. 

  No. 

   i  Please  Let go  No   i  

  It s a good thing. 

  A great thing. 

 i    Stop. Stop  

 i   Please   i  

 i   Hear us now  my Lord. 

 i   You can t do this   i  

 i   For you  we offer up this girl 

  Please  

  i ...that you may cleanse her with your fire 

and that its light 

may lead our way. 

 i  Please  No  please 

let me see my father. 

If we don t act  

we ll all starve here. 

 i  All of us. 

But if we make this sacrifice... 

 i Accept this token 

of our faith  my Lord  

and lead us from the darkness. 

  Lord of Light  show us the way. 

  Mother  

Mother  please  

Mother  please  

Mother  

   i  Mother   i  

  We can t. 

  There s no other way. She has king s blood. 

  i  Please don t do this  

 i Lord of 

Light  protect us. 

  Please  Father  please  

  i  For the night is dark and full of terrors. 

Father  

Father  don t do this  

Please  

Mother  no  Please  

Please  help  

Don t do this  

Please  Father  

Mother  help  

  No. 

  i  No  please  Don t do this  

 i Don t do this  please  Mother  

 i Please  Mother   i  

 i Mother  help  

Mother  help  

Help  

 i Please don t do this  Mother  

 i Please  

 i Please  Mother   i  

 i Please  

 i Please  No  

 i Please  No  

No  

Where have you been  

Just making sure 

everything is in order. 

They re waiting for you. 

Clap your hands. 

That one  the smaller man. 

No question  that s where 

you should put your money. 

The smaller man it is. 

I m not putting 

my money anywhere. 

Kings and queens 

never bet on the games. 

Perhaps you should go 

find someone who does. 

People used to bet against me 

when I fought in the pits. 

He would have bet against me. 

Common novice mistake. 

I ve spent much 

of my life in this arena. 

And in my experience  

large men do triumph 

over smaller men 

far more often than not. 

Has your experience ever 

involved any actual fighting  

You yourself  

Have you ever tried to kill another 

man who was trying to kill you  

Whenever I got into the pit 

against a beast like that one  

the crowd saw me  all 

skin and bone back then  

then they saw a pile of angry 

muscles ready to murder me. 

They couldn t get their 

money out fast enough. 

But the pile of angry muscles 

never had any muscles here 

or... here. 

And the big men 

were always too slow 

to stop my dagger from going 

where their muscles weren t. 

Yes  whenever I saw a beast like 

that one standing across from me 

making his beast faces  

I knew I could rest easy. 

You don t approve  

There s always been more than enough 

death in the world for my taste. 

I can do without it 

in my leisure time. 

Fair enough. Yet it s 

an unpleasant question  

but what great thing has ever been 

accomplished without killing or cruelty  

It s easy to confuse what is 

with what ought to be  

especially when what is 

has worked out in your favor. 

I m not talking about myself. 

I m talking about the necessary 

conditions for greatness. 

That is greatness  

That is a vital part of the 

great city of Meereen  

which existed 

long before you or I 

and will remain standing long after 

we have returned to the dirt. 

My father would have liked you. 

One day your great city will 

return to the dirt as well. 

  At your command  

  If need be. 

And how many people will die 

to make this happen  

If it comes to that  they will 

have died for a good reason. 

Those men think they re 

dying for a good reason. 

Someone else s reason. 

So your reasons are true 

and theirs are false  

They don t know their 

own minds  but you do  

Well said. 

You re an eloquent man. 

Doesn t mean you re wrong. 

In my experience  

eloquent men are right 

every bit as often as imbeciles. 

  Your Grace   

  Shut your mouth. 

  You can end this. 

  She cannot. 

You can. 

Protect your queen  

Go  

Your Grace  

Your Grace  

 i Come with me.  i  

 i I know a way out. 

I know a way   

Stay close. 

This way. 

The other side. 

Follow me. 

Protect your queen  

Drogon  

 i Valahd. 

Mance   i Why do you want 

to join us  Jon Snow   i  

I saw Craster take his own baby 

boy and leave it in the woods. 

I saw what took it. 

When I told the Lord 

Commander  he already knew. 

I want to fight for the side 

that fights for the living. 

How did you kill those guards  

  Show me how. 

  If you would learn  you must come with me. 

I want to  but I need to 

find my brother and mother. 

And my sister. 

You have to go. 

Go to the Wall  to Jon. 

Osha  you must protect them. 

You re the only one who can.

 i For them and for your sons.  i  

They rot in the ground

Those were Stark men. 

I don t serve the Starks. 

I serve Lady Catelyn. 

I told you I d take you

I m going to do.

My mother s always had 

a penchant for drama. 

Facts become less and less 

important to her

You said you d take me home. 

If you were to tell just one... 

Please  Lord Baelish  

tell me what to do. 

  Tell me when.

Watch out for her with him.

I tried to kill it  

but I couldn t. 

  There was a boy. 

   i I don t want to hear about it.  i  

  But you asked. 

  We ve got plenty of worries. 

We don t need to pour 

black magic on top of them. 

I didn t ask 

for black magic dreams. 

I know you didn t  little lord. 

 i   birds screeching    i  

We need to move. 

We don t know 

who might be after us. 

No one even knows we re alive. 

And who told you that

 i tell you   i  

  No. 

  Some good he is  then. 

 i I don t know what other people 

know and what they don t.  i  

I only know the Wall 

is a long way off. 

My mother always told me 

you Westerosi were a grim lot. 

Grim  bearded  

stinking barbarians 

that would row 

across the Narrow Sea 

and steal us from our beds. 

Did you ever think 

you d marry one  

I never thought 

I d marry anyone at all. 

Never  

Not until I met 

the king of the grim  

bearded  stinking barbarians. 

 i   door opens    i  

Pardon me  Your Grace. 

  My queen. 

  Lord Bolton. 

Let me guess which one 

is the good news. 

Word from Riverrun 

and Winterfell. 

  crying   

I hadn t seen him in years. 

I don t even know how many. 

We ll travel 

to the funeral together. 

 i Lord Bolton will garrison here  i  

 i until we return.  i  

Will I be wearing manacles 

when I lay my father to rest  

Something else  

By the time Bolton s 

bastard got to Winterfell  

the ironborn were gone. 

 i They massacred everyone and 

put the castle to the torch.  i  

And Bran and Rickon 

have not been found. 

They may have escaped. 

Or Theon may have taken them back 

to the Iron Islands as hostages. 

Have you received any demands  

. 

Have you heard anything 

from Theon at all  

  gasps   

  shivering   

Where am I  

Who are you  

What do you want  

I want to do this. 

  screaming   

Do you know how long 

it s going to take us 

to get to King s Landing walking 

through fields and forests  

Yes. 

 i   sheep bleating    i  

So how shall we pass the time  

By putting one foot 

in front of the other. 

It s going to be 

a very dull walk. 

I m here to take you 

to King s Landing 

and bring back Lady Stark s 

daughters in exchange. 

Dull is fine. 

You know  it doesn t matter 

how loyal a servant you are  

no one enjoys the company 

of a humorless mute. 

Trust me on this. 

People have been serving me 

since I was born. 

You think Lady Stark is going 

to want a giant towheaded plank 

following her around 

for the rest of her life  

A week s journey with you and she ll 

order you to fall on your sword. 

If Lady Stark is unhappy 

with any aspect of my service  

I m sure she ll let me know. 

She s an honest woman. 

All the good it s done her. 

  moans   

How did you come into 

Lady Stark s service  

There s something 

we can talk about. 

Not your concern  Kingslayer. 

It had to be recently. 

You weren t with her 

at Winterfell. 

How would you know  

Because I visited Winterfell. 

I would have noticed 

your dour head 

smacking into the archways. 

Move. 

  Were you pledged to Stannis  

  Gods  no. 

Ah  Renly. 

Really  

He wasn t fit 

to rule over anything 

more important than 

a  course meal. 

  Shut your mouth. 

  Why  

I lived with him at court since 

he was a boy  don t forget. 

Could hardly escape 

the little tulip. 

Skipping down the corridors 

in his embroidered silks. 

I knew him far better than you. 

I knew him as well as anyone. 

As a member of his Kingsguard  

he trusted me with everything. 

He would have been 

a wonderful king. 

Sounds like you 

quite fancied him. 

I did not fancy him. 

Oh  gods  you did. 

 i Did you ever tell him   i  

No  of course not. 

You weren t Renly s 

type  I m afraid. 

He preferred curly haired 

little girls like Loras Tyrell. 

You re far too much 

man for him. 

I m not interested 

in foul rumors. 

Unless they re about me. 

It s all true about Renly. 

His proclivities were the 

worst kept secret at court. 

It s a shame the throne 

isn t made out of cocks. 

  They d have never got him off it. 

  Shut your mouth  

I don t blame him. 

And I don t blame you  either. 

We don t get to choose 

who we love. 

 i   horse snorts    i  

  Where are you headed  then  

  Jaime  South. 

  You  

  Riverrun. 

Staying off 

the kingsroad  are you  

They get you no matter 

where you go. 

  You can t win. 

  No  you really can t. 

Looks like you re 

safe enough  though. 

Meaning no offense  

my lady  but... 

  laughs   I wouldn t 

tangle with you. 

  laughs   

  Seven blessings to you. 

  And you. 

Jaime  

 i He knows who I am.  i  

  He doesn t. 

  Maybe you re right. 

But what if you re not  

What if he tells someone  

We re not doing it. 

 i He s an innocent man.  i  

More innocent than 

Lady Stark s daughters  

Make it tighter here. 

That s better. 

 i It makes you look very strong.  i  

No flowers. 

I said no flowers. 

All these are wrong. 

Bring others. 

Yes  Your Grace. 

Bloody flowers. 

On the king. 

Looks like a Tyrell rose. 

Give it to Margaery 

for her wedding gown. 

Should be more 

than enough fabric. 

Tell me what you think of her. 

Who  

Margaery. 

She s an ideal match. 

With the Tyrells beside us  

we ll crush the Northerners. 

Hang their lords  

burn their strongholds  

sow their fields with salt  

and no one will think of 

rebelling for another century. 

It is a good match  but 

what do you think of her  

She s beautiful 

and intelligent. 

Yes  she is. 

Her concern with the well being of 

the common people is interesting. 

Not to me. 

  chuckles   

I only meant that to go out of 

your way to endanger yourself   

This is becoming 

one of the most boring 

conversations I ve ever had. 

Margaery Tyrell dotes on 

filthy urchins for a reason. 

She dresses like 

a harlot for a reason. 

She married a traitor 

and known degenerate 

like Renly Baratheon 

for a reason. 

She married Renly Baratheon 

because she was told to. 

That s what 

intelligent women do   

what they re told. 

  You need to ask yourself   

  I don t need to do anything. 

  sighs   

Better. 

Much better. 

I still don t believe it. 

He didn t. 

He didn t want anything. 

He just takes an interest 

because he loved my mother. 

Men only want one thing 

from a pretty girl. 

Littlefinger s not 

in love with me. 

Love is not the thing he wants. 

He s too old. 

They never see it that way. 

He didn t ask you 

to do something for him  

Spy on someone or...  

No. 

If he does ask you for anything 

or try anything 

or touch you  

I want you to tell me. 

Why  

What will you do  

I will make him stop. 

 i   knocks    i  

Guard  

 i Ser Loras Tyrell  my lady.  i  

Send him in. 

Lady Sansa. 

Ser Loras. 

My sister Margaery 

invites you to take 

the air with her 

and our grandmother 

the Lady Olenna in the gardens. 

May I escort you to them  

I believe you grow more beautiful 

every day  Lady Sansa. 

You are too kind  Ser Loras. 

You probably don t remember 

the first time we met. 

At the Hand s tourney  

you gave me your favor. 

A rose  a red rose. 

Of course I did. 

Margaery  

 i It s more your color.  i  

  You take it. 

  Thank you. 

You re such a dear. 

I ll take my leave. 

Lady Sansa. 

Thank you  Ser Loras. 

Come. 

Lady Sansa  it is my honor 

to present my grandmother... 

the Lady Olenna 

of House Tyrell. 

Kiss me  child. 

It s so good of you to visit me 

and my foolish flock of hens. 

We re very sorry 

for your losses. 

And I was sorry when I heard of 

Lord Renly s death  Lady Margaery. 

  He was very gallant. 

  Gallant  yes. 

And charming and very clean. 

He knew how to dress and smile 

and somehow this gave him the 

notion he was fit to be king. 

Renly was brave 

and gentle  Grandmother. 

Father liked him 

and so did Loras. 

Loras is young and very good 

at knocking men 

off horses with a stick. 

That does not make him wise. 

As to your 

fathead father   

Grandmother  What will 

Sansa think of us  

 i She might think we have  i  

 i some wits about us.  i  

One of us  at any rate. 

It was treason. 

I warned them. 

Robert has two sons and 

Renly has an older brother. 

How could he possibly 

have any claim 

to that ugly iron chair  

We should have stayed well out 

of all this if you ask me. 

But once the cow s been milked  

there s no squirting 

the cream back up her udders. 

So here we are 

to see things through. 

What do you say to that  Sansa  

Shall we have some lemon cakes  

Lemon cake s my favorite. 

So we ve been told. 

Are you going to bring the food or 

do you mean to starve us to death  

Here  Sansa  

come sit with me. 

I m much less boring 

than these others. 

Do you know my son  

The Lord of Highgarden  

I haven t had the pleasure. 

No great pleasure  believe me. 

A ponderous oaf. 

 i His father was an oaf as well.  i  

 i My husband   i  

 i the late Lord Luthor.  i  

He managed to ride off 

a cliff whilst hawking. 

They say he was looking 

up at the sky 

and paying no mind to where 

his horse was taking him. 

And now my son 

is doing the same  

only this time he s riding 

a lion instead of a horse. 

Now... 

I want you to tell me the truth 

about this royal boy  

this Joffrey. 

I... I... 

You  you. 

Who else would know better  

We ve heard 

some troubling tales. 

Is there any truth to them  

 i Has this boy mistreated you   i  

Has he ripped out your tongue  

Joff   King Joffrey  

he   His Grace 

is very fair 

and handsome 

and as brave as a lion. 

Yes  all Lannisters are lions. 

And when a Tyrell farts  

it smells like a rose. 

 i But how kind is he   i  

 i How clever   i  

Has he a good heart  

a gentle hand  

I m to be his wife. 

I only want to know 

what that means. 

 i   footsteps approaching    i  

Bring me some cheese. 

The cheese will be served 

after the cakes  my lady. 

The cheese will be served 

when I want it served. 

And I want it served now. 

Are you frightened  child  

No need for that. 

We re only women here. 

Tell us the truth. 

No harm will come to you. 

My father always 

told the truth. 

Yes  he had that reputation. 

And they named him traitor 

and took his head. 

Joffrey. 

Joffrey did that. 

He promised he would be merciful 

and he cut my father s head off. 

And he said that was mercy. 

Then he took me up on the 

walls and made me look at it. 

Go on. 

I   I can t. 

I never meant   

my father was a traitor. 

My brother as well. 

I have traitor s blood. 

Please don t make me 

say anymore. 

She s terrified  Grandmother. 

  Just look at her. 

  Speak freely  child. 

We would never betray your 

confidence  I swear it. 

He s a monster. 

Ah. 

 i That s a pity.  i  

Please  don t stop the wedding. 

Have no fear. 

The Lord Oaf of Highgarden 

 i is determined that  i  

 i Margaery shall be queen.  i  

Even so  we thank you 

for the truth. 

Ah  here comes my cheese. 

  panting   

Karstark  

 i We re at war.  i  

 i This march is a distraction.  i  

My grandfather s funeral 

is not a distraction. 

  Are we riding to battle at Riverrun  

  No. 

Then it s a distraction. 

My Uncle Edmure has his 

forces garrisoned there. 

We need his men. 

Unless he s been breeding them  

he don t have enough 

to make a difference. 

Have you lost faith 

in our cause  

If it s revenge  

I still got faith in it. 

If you no longer 

believe   

I can believe 

till it snows in Dorne. 

Don t change the fact 

that we ve got half the men. 

You don t think we can win  

May I speak my mind  

Your Grace  

Have you not been speaking 

your mind  Lord Karstark  

I think you lost this war 

the day you married her. 

 i   horse whinnies    i  

Whoa  whoa. 

Your Grace. 

You re afraid of her. 

  And she knows it. 

  I m not afraid of her. 

  snorting   

May I help you  Lady Stark  

No. 

I m sorry  

I shouldn t have   

You can t help because a mother 

makes one for her 

children to protect them. 

Only a mother can make them. 

You ve made them before  

Twice. 

Did they work  

After a fashion. 

I prayed for my son Bran 

to survive his fall. 

Many years before that  

one of the boys came down 

with the pox. 

Maester Luwin said if he made it 

through the night  he d live. 

But it would be 

a very long night. 

So I sat with him 

all through the darkness. 

Listened to his ragged 

little breaths  

his coughing  his whimpering. 

 i Which boy   i  

Jon Snow. 

When my husband brought 

that baby home from the war  

I couldn t bear to look at him. 

I didn t want 

to see those brown 

 i stranger s eyes  i  

 i staring up at me.  i  

 i So I prayed to the gods   i  

 i take him away.  i  

Make him die. 

He got the pox. 

 i And I knew I was the worst  i  

 i woman who ever lived.  i  

A murderer. 

I d condemned this poor  

innocent child 

to a horrible death 

all because I was 

jealous of his mother. 

A woman he didn t even know. 

So I prayed to all seven gods  

let the boy live. 

Let him live 

and I ll love him. 

I ll be a mother to him. 

I ll beg my husband 

to give him a true name  

to call him Stark 

and be done with it  

to make him one of us. 

And he lived. 

And he lived. 

And I couldn t keep my promise. 

 i And everything  i  

 i that s happened since then...  i  

 i all this horror  i  

 i that s come to my family...  i  

it s all because I couldn t 

love a motherless child. 

Was it hard for you 

to kill the Halfhand  

Yes. 

You liked him  

I like you  but if 

you re playing us false  

it won t be hard 

for me to kill you. 

I ve got wildling 

blood in my veins. 

  These are my people. 

  I understand. 

Well  how could you understand  

You want to protect 

your people. 

Do you know what it takes 

to unite  clans  

half of whom want 

to massacre the other half 

for one insult or another  

They speak seven different 

languages in my army. 

 i The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.  i  

 i The Hornfoots hate  i  

 i the ice river clans.  i  

Everyone hates the cave people. 

So you know how I got 

moon worshippers 

and cannibals and giants 

to march together 

in the same army  

No. 

I told them we were 

all going to die 

if we don t get south. 

Because that s the truth. 

Shouldn t be long now. 

  screeching   

What s wrong with him  

Mance  

 i He s a warg.  i  

He can enter the mind of 

animals  see through their eyes. 

He s scouting for us. 

What  you ve never met a warg  

  screeching   

Mance  

 i Orell.  i  

  shivers   

Where were you this time  

The Fist of the First Men. 

What did you see  

  chuckles   

Dead crows. 

  men coughing   

Rast  

What s the matter  Piggy  

You crying  cause you re cold  

There s  brothers 

killed by dead men 

and you re still here 

whimpering. 

That seem fair to you  

I seen  em torn 

to pieces fighting 

while you was off somewhere 

hiding in a hole. 

Why don t you lie down 

and rest for a while  eh  

You know you want to. 

Hey. 

Get up  Sam. 

  No. 

   i Get up.  i  

I can t. 

If you stop  you ll die. 

 Course if you don t stop  

you ll probably die  too. 

  You don t care. 

   Course we care. 

You left me. 

When the white walkers came  

you left me. 

Aye  we left you. 

 i You re fat and you re slow.  i  

We didn t want to die. 

 i   Sam sobbing    i  

Help me get him up. 

Looks like that piggy 

is done for. 

  Help us get him up. 

  He s slowing us down. 

Just get him up  

Why  So the rest 

of us can die  

We ll move faster without him. 

What is this  

Get up  Tarly. 

  Is he all right  

  Aye  I think so. 

If he can t  we may as 

well just go without him. 

That s enough. 

Tarly  

I forbid you to die. 

Do you hear me  

  Why should the rest of us   

  Rast... 

you re responsible for him. 

What am I supposed to do  

Make sure he gets back alive. 

If he doesn t  you don t. 

Move on  

I m not dying for you  Piggy. 

You hear me  

   i   branch snaps    i  

   i   wolf growling    i  

Where s Rickon and Hodor  

Looking for food. 

  growling   

What s out there  

  growling   

  growling   

Osha  

 i Not another step  boy.  i  

 i Unless you want to drown  i  

 i in your own blood.  i  

I m unarmed. 

That was poor planning. 

My sister carries the weapons. 

I m better with them. 

 i Drop the spear.  i  

 i Drop it.  i  

If you kill me  

that wolf will tear 

you to bits. 

  growling   

You must be Summer. 

  sniffing   

I m Jojen Reed. 

This is my sister Meera. 

We ve come a long way 

to find you  Brandon. 

And we have much farther to go. 

Gendry  I m just 

trying to understand. 

Arya  Would you please 

shut up about it  

Jaqen H ghar offered 

you three kills. 

  I m not listening. 

  But just explain it to me. 

He offered to kill 

any three people you wanted. 

Dead. All you had to do 

was give him the names. 

Anyone. You could have 

picked King Joffrey. 

  Shut up. 

  You could have picked Tywin Lannister. 

Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal  

so why are you complaining  

But you could have 

ended the war. 

  Where are we going  

  North. 

If we were going north  

we should have come to the 

Red Fork River by now. 

Maybe we already passed it. 

It s  feet wide. 

How could we have passed it  

If we hit the Red Fork  

we can follow it west 

to Riverrun. 

My mother grew up there. 

My grandfather s a lord. 

He ll protect us. 

 i   man singing    i  

Could be a minstrel. 

Shut up. 

 i     A lion  i  

 i still has claws...      i  

Hot Pie   i A minstrel s 

got gold sometimes.  i  

 i We could jump him   i  

 i tie him up  steal his gold   i  

  and buy some food. 

  Shh. 

    And so he spoke  

and so he spoke     

 i     That Lord of Castamere      i  

    But now the rains     

    Weep o er his hall     

    With no one there 

to hear.     

  gasps   

Singer   i What s lurking 

behind that wall   i  

 i A lion   i  

 i A wolf   i  

Archer   i Just a dirty 

little cub  I think.  i  

  Singer   i Loose a few more shafts.  i  

  Don t. 

Put the sword down  girl. 

You go on down the road. 

Just keep on singing 

so we know where you are. 

Leave us be 

and I won t kill you. 

  laughing   

Generous. 

You re a dangerous person. 

I like dangerous people. 

Why are your friends so shy  

What friends  

The fat one to your left 

and the lad beside him. 

Three young ones on the run 

carrying 

castle forged swords. 

You escape from Harrenhal  

  Arya   i Who are you   i  

  Thoros of Myr. 

And the fellow here 

with the bow is Anguy. 

No  who do you fight for  

 i The Brotherhood  i  

 i without Banners.  i  

Now come along. 

I want to hear how two boys 

and a very dangerous girl 

escaped Harrenhal. 

I m not going with them. 

The Brotherhood  

That s who the Mountain 

and them lot were looking for. 

They ll bring us back 

and put rats in us. 

You ve got nothing 

to fear from us  son. 

The lords of Westeros 

want to burn the countryside. 

We re trying to save it. 

Now come on. 

We ll talk some more 

over brown bread and stew. 

And then you can go 

on your way. 

Here s the thing  fat boy. 

When I m done talking  

that arrow s falling down 

on your fat head. 

So I advise you move  

because I m done talking. 

  men laughing   

Half the country s starving 

and look at this one. 

Maybe he s the reason 

half the country s starving. 

My lion. 

We ve spoken of this. 

You cannot come here. 

But you said I should come 

to you with any problems. 

Did anyone see you  

  No. 

  You sure  

My father does not 

make idle threats. 

Having you killed would be 

the high point of his week. 

You have to be 

absolutely certain. 

All right. 

What is this problem  

I m worried about Sansa. 

When she spoke 

with Lord Baelish  

his friend warned me about him. 

Baelish doesn t have friends. 

I don t know her name. 

  Oh  Ros  The redhead  

  How do you know her  

I try to know 

as many people as I can. 

You never know 

which one you ll need. 

She s a whore. 

Yes  well  we shouldn t be 

judgmental about these things. 

  You fucked her. 

  Oh  please. 

All right  yes  

I fucked her once. 

Twice. 

But since I met you  my lady  

I ve been with no one else. 

And was she good  

Did you like her  

Not as much 

as I like you  obviously  

or she d be the one 

torturing me right now. 

What did she say 

about Littlefinger  

That Sansa shouldn t trust him. 

Is there an idiot 

in any village 

who trusts Littlefinger  

We have to protect her. 

We can t. 

Now that the Lannisters 

have discarded her  

Sansa will have many suitors. 

A great beauty 

with a very old name. 

A great beauty  

Oh  a great beauty  

Yes  she is  objectively  very. 

Her face 

is quite pleasing   

to other men and to women  

people in general. 

But not to me  of course. 

I only have eyes for you. 

You pervert. 

You want her  

  This child  

  I don t even want to talk about her. 

  But you are. 

  Only because you re making me. 

  chuckles   I didn t force 

you to open your mouth 

and make words come out. 

This is cruel and unfair. 

Cruelly unfair. 

 Oh  the cruelty. 

Shae is so cruel to me.  

Hmm  yes. 

Now do you think I m cruel  

Only if you stop. 

But you mustn t 

come here again. 

Do you hear me  

You ve come to 

a dangerous place 

full of dangerous people. 

Dangerous people. 

  moans   

   i   knocks    i  

  Guard   i Lady Tyrell  my king.  i  

Send her in. 

You wanted to see me  

Your Grace  

I m leaving on a hunting trip. 

I just wanted to make sure 

you had everything 

you need before I left. 

That s very thoughtful  

Your Grace. 

I have everything I could want. 

Good. Good. 

How are you finding life 

in the capital  

It must be quite a change 

after Renly s camp. 

A welcome one. 

A military encampment 

is no place for a lady. 

And the bedside of a traitor  

Is that a place for a lady  

Your Grace  

I tried to do my duty 

as a wife  that is all. 

What was your duty to this 

traitor as you saw it  

The duty of any wife 

to any husband   

to provide him with children. 

 i You failed to do this.  i  

  Why  

   i I    i  

I would not speak ill 

of the dead  Your Grace. 

You think one ought 

to speak kindly 

of a traitor merely because he s 

had a sword put through his heart  

No. 

I do beg your pardon. 

The subtleties of politics 

are often lost on me. 

Renly... 

I don t believe 

he was interested 

 i in the company of women.  i  

What makes you say this  

Whenever I wanted 

to make a child with him  

he   

he had so many excuses  

so many late night 

war councils. 

He never wanted to try. 

Except one evening  

after he d had far too 

much wine to drink  

he suggested something   

something that sounded 

very painful 

and couldn t possibly 

result in children. 

Maybe the fault was with me. 

No  he was a known... 

degenerate. 

It s such a relief to hear 

you say so  Your Grace. 

Mmm. 

I ve considered 

making his perversion 

punishable by death. 

As is your right. 

You must do whatever 

you need to do. 

You are the king. 

Yes. 

I am. 

Do you like it  

I just had it made. 

Probably one of the finest 

weapons in the Seven Kingdoms. 

It s beautiful. 

Will you show me how it works  

It s a new design. 

Much easier to load. 

There s no crank. 

You use this lever 

to draw the string. 

The bolt goes here. 

And then you just aim... 

and... 

  laughs   

Would you take me 

hunting sometime  

Forgive me  Your Grace. 

I know a hunt 

is no place for a woman. 

It s not unheard of. 

My father would never 

let me before   

You no longer belong to him. 

Do you want to hold it  

May I  

Please. 

I imagine it must be 

so exciting 

to squeeze your finger here 

and watch something 

die over there. 

Could you do it  

Could you... 

kill something  

I don t know  Your Grace. 

Do you think I could  

Yes. 

Would you like to watch me  

Yes. 

  screams   

Stop  Stop  

   i Tell us the truth.  i  

  About what  

  screams   I don t 

know what you want. 

I want the truth. 

What truth  

Why d you take Winterfell  

I took it to   

I took it   

  Who gave the orders  

  No one. 

  I took it on my own. 

   i Why   i  

To take the North 

while it was vulnerable. 

What were you going 

to do once you took it  

Hold it. 

Rule it. 

Good. 

That s very good. 

  screams   

Why did you do that  

I told you. 

Why did you take Winterfell  

I took it to bring glory 

to my house and my father. 

Wait. 

Wait  wait  wait. 

I took it because 

I hated the Starks. 

I hated them 

for holding me prisoner. 

I wanted to hurt them. 

What are you doing  

Please. 

  screaming   

I ll tell you anything. 

Just take it off. 

 i Please.  i  

 i Please  just take it off.  i  

 i   door closes    i  

  Your sister sent me. 

  Yara  

  whimpers   

I ll come for you tonight 

when the castle sleeps. 

No  don t go. 

Please  please. 

No  please don t leave me. 

Please  please. 

Please  please don t go  

  sobbing   Please. Please. 

Don t leave me. 

Please don t go. 

Rickon  stay with us. 

It s all right. 

The wolves will protect him. 

You can get inside his head  

see through his eyes. 

Only when I m asleep. 

That s how it begins until 

you learn to control it. 

You re a warg. 

It s not just wolves. 

Sometimes in my dreams 

there s a   

  A three eyed raven  

   i You ve seen it   i  

We saw him together. 

You haven t forgotten  

Does it have anything 

to do with warging  

No  the raven 

is something different  

something deeper. 

The raven brings the sight. 

Seeing things 

that haven t happened yet  

 i Or things that happened  i  

 i long before you were born  i  

or things that are happening right 

now thousands of miles away. 

What s he telling him  

Why don t you ask  

Isn t he ashamed  your brother  

needing you to protect him  

Where s the shame in that  

Any boy his age who needs 

his sister to protect him 

is gonna find himself 

needing lots of protecting. 

Some people 

will always need help. 

 i That doesn t mean  i  

 i they re not worth helping.  i  

When my father died  

I dreamt it. 

You didn t dream it. 

You saw it. 

So did I. 

You have the sight  too  

When I told my father 

about your father... 

for the first time 

in my life  I saw him cry. 

Your father is Howland Reed  

Yeah. 

He saved my father s life 

during the rebellion. 

Your father told you 

about the rebellion  

Mine never did. 

But I saw that  too. 

What else have you seen  

Only one thing 

that matters   

you. 

 i   men laughing    i  

Thoros   i I never liked 

the skinny ones.  i  

 i Like drinking from a puddle.  i  

Not that I m averse 

to drinking from a puddle 

every now and again  

you understand. 

I don t drink ale. 

There s no story so good 

a drink won t make it better. 

  Yeah  

  You see  

They ve all suffered through 

my bouts of sobriety. 

It s very tedious 

for all concerned. 

Now  how did 

three children   

We re not children. 

How did three young persons 

such as yourselves  

untrained in the art of war  

escape from Harrenhal  

Gendry s a smith. 

He was apprenticed 

in the armory. 

A smith  eh  

Where d you train  

King s Landing. 

Tobho Mott s shop. 

That criminal. 

He charges twice as much 

as every other armorer 

in the city. 

That s because 

he s twice as good. 

Aha  A smith 

and a salesman. 

Gendry stole us weapons. 

Ah  fought your way 

out of Harrenhal  I see. 

He knows how to use a 

sword and so do I. 

  men laugh   

My brothers taught me. 

  men laugh   

Men  

Ooh  

  men cheer   

  To your brothers  

    cheering   

You can finish 

your meals before you go. 

It may be awhile 

before you see another. 

  You ll free us  

  I gave you my word. 

But before you go  

allow me to raise 

a cup to your   

  Hey  hey. 

    men cheering   

Now that is an uncommonly 

large person. 

How does one manage to subdue 

such an uncommonly 

large person  

One waits for him to drink 

until he passes out. 

Poor man. 

You have my sympathy. 

Aha  not a man at all. 

  A Hound  

    men howl and bark   

So good to see 

you again  Clegane. 

Thoros  

The fuck you doing here  

Drinking and talking too much. 

  Same as ever. 

    men laugh   

  A pretty prize  lads. 

  Men  Yeah  

Girl. 

What in seven hells 

are you doing 

with the Stark bitch  

Jaime  

It s a tough decision   

take the bridge 

and risk being seen 

or cross the great water. 

  Silence  Kingslayer. 

  Anyone can see us on the bridge  

but cross by water 

and the current could take us 

or I could escape 

down the river. 

Good luck. 

It s wonderful to watch you 

wrestle with these dilemmas. 

Which will she choose  

Gambler at heart. 

Wouldn t have guessed. 

Be quick about it. 

  Jaime groans   

  I need to rest. 

  Get up. 

I have these  you know  on your 

feet when you walk too far. 

  What do you call them  

  Get up now. 

Corns. I never 

used to get corns. 

 i Of course I used  i  

 i to ride everywhere   i  

not march around 

like a common foot soldier 

wearing the same shit boots 

for over a year. 

This heel is ruined. 

There s no way   

  grunts   

  chuckles   

I never understood why some knights 

felt the need to carry two swords. 

  sighs   

Ooh. 

You move well... 

for a great beast of a woman. 

You shouldn t grimace 

before you lunge. 

It gives away the game. 

 i Bit of a quandary for you.  i  

If you kill me  

you fail Lady Stark. 

 i But if you don t kill me   i  

I m going to kill you. 

You re good. 

Graceless  but good. 

See  If you were 

willing to hurt me  

you might have had me there. 

  grunting   

  grunts   

  panting   

  groans  coughs   

 i   Jaime breathing heavily    i  

 i   horse neighs    i  

Looks like your woman s 

getting the better of you  

if you can call that a woman. 

We enjoy a good fight. 

Gets our juices flowing. 

The Flayed Man of House Bolton. 

A bit gruesome for my taste. 

  You sure he s the one  

  That s him  all right. 

I saw him fight at the tourney 

for Ser Willem Frey s wedding. 

Give the man his silver. 

Let us go and my father will 

pay you whatever you want. 

Enough to buy me a new head  

 i If the King in the North  i  

 i hears I had the Kingslayer  i  

and let him go  

he ll be taking it right off. 

I d rather he takes yours. 

Give him another go  Ned. 

That s my father. 

And my Uncle Benjen. 

Keep your shield up or I ll 

ring your head like a bell. 

They were all so happy. 

So were you once. 

Stop showing off. 

Lyanna  

My Aunt Lyanna. 

 i I ve seen her statue in the crypt.  i  

My father never talked about her. 

 i Would you get out of here  

We re sparring.  i  

Who are you gonna spar with 

when Ned goes off to the Eyrie  

 i I don t know.  i  

What about him  

Wylis  come here. 

Hodor  

 i But he s got giant s blood.  i  

And you ve got training. Sounds 

like a fair match to me. 

Benjen always lifts his chin 

when he s about to charge. 

And lowers it when he s 

going to dodge  my lady. 

Hodor talks  

You leave the fighting 

to the little lords  Wylis. 

Come along  now. 

It s no place for you. 

Oh  Nan  look at the size of him. 

If he ever learned to 

fight  he d be unstoppable. 

Well  he s never going to learn to 

fight because he s a stable boy. 

So leave him be. 

It is time to go. 

Please  a little longer. 

You finally show me 

something I care about 

and then you drag me away. 

It is beautiful beneath the sea  

but if you stay too long  

you ll drown. 

I wasn t drowning. 

I was home. 

Wylis. 

Hodor. 

I saw you as a boy. 

You could talk. 

What happened  

Hodor. 

Where s Meera  

Hodor. 

You shouldn t be here. 

It s not safe outside the cave. 

It s not safe anywhere. 

I saw that Hodor wasn t always Hodor. 

 i   Hodor. 

  His real name is Wylis.  i  

And he could talk and 

fight and   and then   

What s wrong  

The Three Eyed Raven 

says there s a war coming. 

And we re going to fight it in there  

Brandon Stark needs you. 

For what  

I sit in there 

and I watch him have his visions 

and nothing ever happens. 

He isn t going to stay here forever. 

And out there he needs you. 

 i It s time  Ser Davos.  i  

Open the door and the men inside 

can rejoin their brothers in peace. 

We ll even set the wolf free north 

of the Wall where it belongs. 

Nobody needs to die tonight. 

I ve never been much of a fighter. 

Apologies for what 

you re about to see. 

Come on. 

Attack  

Fight  you cowards  

You fucking traitor. 

The only traitors here are the ones 

who shoved their knives into 

their Lord Commander s heart. 

For thousands of years 

the Night s Watch 

has held Castle Black 

against the wildlings. 

Until you. 

Throw them into the cells 

where they belong. 

 i Took a lot of knives.  i  

I ll have my men 

get the wood for a fire. 

Bodies to burn. 

 i  Shh  hey.  i  

Right  so there she is  

high and mighty Queen Cersei  

tits and ass jiggling in the breeze. 

All of a sudden she looks my way. 

Gives me a little smile 

like   Well   

So  all right  you know  

I ve never been shy 

and I m blessed down south  

so I put it right out. 

She s never seen anything like it. 

I mean  she s used to her 

brother and from what I hear  

Jaime Lannister s half 

an inch shy of an inch. 

Ooh  

She sees it and I swear to 

the gods she licks her lips. 

Well  you all know me. 

You know I wouldn t lie about this. 

Get out of my way. 

King s orders  Your Grace. 

What are the king s orders  

He would like you to remain 

in the Red Keep  Your Grace  

for your own protection. 

You re barring me from attending 

my own daughter s funeral  

Forgive me  Your Grace  by the king s 

command  I cannot let you pass. 

I would like to speak to my son. 

He has left the Red Keep  Your Grace. 

She grew up. 

 i Almost.  i  

Have we caught Prince 

Trystane s killers  

I expect it was Mother. 

Your mother wouldn t do that. 

Yes  she would. 

Are you angry with her  

  Of course not. 

  Then why didn t you let her come  

She has every right to be here. 

They told me she wouldn t 

be allowed in the sept. 

If she had tried   

They re not putting 

your mother in a cell ever again. 

Not while I m here. 

Why haven t you gone to see her  

Everything she endured  

she did it for you. 

Don t you think I know that  

I m sorry. 

But I can t. 

Why not  

When the Faith Militant 

seized her and Margaery  

what did I do  

When they paraded her through 

the streets like a whore  

what did I do  

We all fail sometimes. 

The king is supposed to be 

the Protector of the Realm. 

If I can t even protect my 

own wife or my own mother  

what good am I  

Go and see your mother 

and ask her to forgive you. 

Your Grace. 

Lord Commander. 

I want to see my wife. 

The gods wait for Queen Margaery 

to confess her crimes 

and seek their mercy. 

The king must wait as well. 

Go and see your mother  Tommen. 

You re a bold man. 

On the contrary. 

I fear a great deal. 

The Father  the Mother  

the Warrior. 

Do you know why we use these stones  

To remind us not to fear death. 

We close our eyes on this world 

and open them on the next. 

You must long for the next life. 

In truth  I fear that  too. 

You imprisoned 

and humiliated my sister. 

Your sister sought the gods  mercy 

and atoned for her sin. 

What about my sins  

I broke a sacred oath and 

stabbed my king in the back. 

I killed my own cousin. 

When the gods judged 

my brother guilty  

I helped him escape their justice. 

What atonement do I deserve  

You would spill blood 

in this holy place  

Oh  the gods won t mind. 

They ve spilled more blood 

than the rest of us combined. 

Go on  then. 

I deserve it. 

We all do. 

We are weak  vain creatures. 

We live only by the Mother s mercy. 

They should be closer if you 

mean for them to save you. 

I don t. 

They d never reach me 

before you struck. 

I ve fought against worse odds. 

No doubt many of us would fall. 

But who are we  hmm  

We have no names  no family. 

Every one of us 

is poor and powerless. 

And yet together  

we can overthrow an empire. 

 i Mother.  i  

Did they put her in the 

red gown or the gold  

Gold. 

Good. It was always her color. 

I m sorry for keeping you here. 

 i I shouldn t have  

but I was    i  

I didn t want to lose you again. 

I understand. 

I m glad to see you. 

I know I should have come sooner. 

I wanted to. 

I was wrong. 

It s all right. 

No  it isn t. 

I should have executed all of them. 

I should have pulled down the sept 

onto the High Sparrow s head 

before I let them do that to you  

as you would have for me. 

You raised me to be strong... 

and I wasn t. 

But I want to be. 

Help me. 

Always. 

If I lost my cock  

I d drink all the time. 

Meaning no offense. 

He makes dwarf jokes  

I make eunuch jokes. 

I do not make dwarf jokes. 

You think them. 

So  the fleet. 

It s been burned. 

We are searching for the men who burned 

the ships  but nobody saw anything. 

Surely there s some good 

news lurking somewhere. 

Astapor and Yunkai have 

stopped asking us for aid. 

Perhaps they can 

tell us their secret. 

The Masters have retaken both cities. 

Outside of Meereen  the whole of Slaver s 

Bay has returned to the slavers. 

What about the dragons  We have two 

of them here beneath the pyramid. 

They are not eating. 

They haven t touched any food 

since Queen Daenerys left. 

Daenerys is the dragon queen. 

Can t very well let the dragons 

starve  that s obvious. 

If a dragon does not want to eat  

how do you force him to eat  

Dragons do not do well in captivity. 

  How do you know this  

  That s what I do. 

I drink and I know things. 

The dragons Aegon used 

to conquer Westeros 

ranged over hundreds of miles. 

Then Daenerys s ancestors 

started chaining them up in pens. 

A few generations later  

the last dragons 

were no larger than cats. 

They must be unchained 

or they ll waste away. 

Missandei  

how many times were you in the 

company of these dragons  

  Many times. 

  And did they ever harm you  

Never. 

Dragons are intelligent. 

More intelligent than men 

according to some maesters. 

They have affection for their friends 

and fury for their enemies. 

  I am their friend. 

  Do they know that  

They will. It s time 

they had their supper. 

I m friends with your mother. 

I m here to help. 

Don t eat the help. 

When I was a child  

an uncle asked what gift 

I wanted for my name day. 

I begged him for one of you. 

 It wouldn t even have to be 

a big dragon   I told him. 

 It could be little 

like me.  

Everyone laughed like it was the 

funniest thing they had ever heard. 

Then my father told me 

the last dragon had died 

a century ago. 

I cried myself to sleep that night. 

But here you are. 

Next time I have an idea like that  

punch me in the face. 

What s your name  

What s your name  

  No one. 

  I don t believe that. 

You don t believe that. 

Who are you  

No one. 

If a girl says her name  

a man will let her sleep 

under a roof tonight. 

A girl has no name. 

If a girl says her name  

a man will feed her tonight. 

A girl has no name. 

If a girl says her name  

a man will give her eyes back. 

A girl has no name. 

Come. 

Leave it. 

 i A girl is not a beggar anymore.  i  

We came upon the bodies 

on our way here. 

Half a dozen men  

Your best hunters  

They obviously had help. 

I didn t think Lady Sansa 

killed them all by herself. 

Thank you for this report  

Lord Karstark. 

We know where she s going. 

Her brother s at Castle Black. 

Ned Stark s last surviving son  

Jon Snow is a bastard  not a Stark. 

So was I  Father. 

Your hold on the North 

will never be secure 

as long as a Stark 

can walk through that door. 

Castle Black isn t defended 

on the southern side. 

And the few men left are barely men at all. 

Farm boys and thieves. 

With a small force  we could storm 

the castle  kill Jon Snow   

Murder the Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch  

You d unite every house 

in the North against us. 

We don t need 

every house in the North. 

 i The Umbers  the Manderlys  

and the Karstarks  i  

command more soldiers than all 

the other houses combined. 

With their support  

none could challenge us. 

The Starks lost my house the day 

King Robb cut off my father s head. 

It s time for new blood in the North. 

If you acquire a 

reputation as a mad dog  

you ll be treated as a mad dog. 

Taken out back and 

slaughtered for pig feed. 

 i My lords.  i  

 i Lady Walda has given birth.  i  

A boy. 

 i Red cheeked 

and healthy.  i  

My congratulations  Lord Bolton. 

Congratulations  Father. 

I look forward to meeting 

my new brother. 

You ll always be my firstborn. 

Thank you for saying that. 

It means a great deal to me. 

Maester Wolkan  

 i send ravens to all the northern houses. 

Roose Bolton is dead.  i  

Poisoned by our enemies. 

How did he die  

Poisoned by his enemies. 

You re talking to your lord. 

Use respect. 

Forgive me  my lord. 

Send for Lady Walda and the baby. 

She s resting  my lord. 

At once  my lord. 

There he is. 

Isn t he wonderful  

May I hold him  

Of   of course. 

Little brother. 

Lord Bolton sent for us. 

Have you seen him  

Of course. 

Follow me  Mother. 

Where is Lord Bolton  

Down  

 i  It s all right. Come on  shh.  i  

 i It s cold out here  Ramsay. 

I need to feed him.  i  

Ramsay  where is your father  

Ramsay. 

Where is Lord Bolton  

I am Lord Bolton. 

Ramsay. 

Ramsay  please. 

I ll leave Winterfell. 

I ll go back to the Riverlands. 

Please. 

Ramsay. 

He s your brother. 

I prefer being an only child. 

 i I saw her with a man.  i  

I don t think he hurt her. 

She didn t want to leave him  

he didn t want to leave her. 

You don t know which way she went  

I spent three days looking for her. 

She disappeared. 

How d she look  

She looked good. 

She wasn t exactly 

dressed like a lady. 

No  she wouldn t be. 

What happened at Winterfell  

I should have gone with you 

while I had the chance. 

It was a difficult choice  my lady. 

We ve all had to make 

difficult choices. 

We shouldn t be lighting fires. 

It s not safe. 

He won t stop hunting us. 

We just have to make it 

to Castle Black. 

Once we re with Jon  Ramsay 

won t be able to touch us. 

Jon will have me killed the 

moment I step through the gate. 

I won t let him. 

I ll tell him the truth 

about Bran and Rickon. 

And the truth about the farm 

boys I killed in their place. 

And the truth about 

Ser Rodrik  who I beheaded. 

And the truth about Robb  

who I betrayed. 

When you take the black  

all your crimes are forgiven. 

I don t want to be forgiven. 

I can never make 

amends to your family 

for the things I ve done. 

They ll keep you safer 

than I ever could. 

You re not coming with us  

I would have taken you 

all the way to the Wall. 

I would have died to get you there. 

May I take one of the horses  

Where will you go  

Home. 

 i The Glovers have 

retaken Deepwood Motte.  i  

And the ironborn who held it  

They died fighting to a man. 

What is dead may never die. 

What is dead may never die. 

But they did 

and our invasion died with them. 

Deepwood Motte was our last 

stronghold on the mainland. 

Then we will take more. 

Why  For more pinecones and rocks  

Because I order it. 

We can defeat anyone at sea  

but we ll never hold 

lands and castles 

against mainland armies. 

Not if our captains defy my orders  

abandon their posts  and sacrifice 

our men on foolish missions. 

I won t apologize 

for trying to rescue Theon. 

Then where is he  

Where is your kingdom  

We took those castles because the 

northerners marched off to war. 

That war is over. 

The last time 

we provoked them too far  

I watched from that window 

as they breached our walls 

 i and knocked down our towers.  i  

 i I lost two brothers that day.  i  

And I lost three sons. 

The War of the Five 

Kings  they call it. 

Well  the other four are dead. 

When you rule the Iron Islands  you 

can wage all the peace you want. 

But for now  shut your mouth and obey 

or I will make another heir who will. 

Let me pass. 

You fool  move aside for your king. 

Haven t I always  brother  

I thought you d be rotting 

under some foreign sea by now. 

What is dead may never die. 

Has the custom changed 

since I ve been gone  

Aren t you supposed 

to repeat the words  

You can mock our god without my help. 

I don t mock the Drowned God. 

I am the Drowned God. 

From Oldtown to Qarth  

when men see my sails  they pray. 

You re old  brother. 

 i You ve had your time.  i  

Now let another rule. 

I heard you lost your mind 

during a storm on the Jade Sea. 

They tied you to the mast to 

keep you from jumping overboard. 

They did. 

And when the storm passed  

you cut out their tongues. 

I needed silence. 

What kind of an ironborn 

loses his senses during a storm  

I am the storm  brother. 

The first storm and the last. 

And you re in my way. 

Lord  take your servant Balon 

back beneath the waves. 

Feed the creatures of your 

kingdom on his flesh. 

Pull his bones down to your depths 

to rest beside his ancestors 

and his children. 

What is dead may never die. 

I m going to find out who did this. 

I m going to feed them to 

the sharks while they live. 

I swear it by the Salt Throne. 

The Salt Throne is not 

yours to swear upon  

not unless the kingsmoot chooses you. 

My father would have 

wanted me to rule. 

Your father does not get to choose. 

The law is clear. 

Perhaps you ll win. 

Perhaps you ll be the first woman 

in history to rule the ironborn. 

And perhaps not. 

Come in. 

I m sorry  my lady. 

Didn t mean to interrupt. 

You interrupt nothing. 

I assume you know why I m here. 

I will after you tell me. 

It s about the Lord Commander. 

The former Lord Commander. 

Does he have to be  

What are you asking  

Do you know of any magic... 

that could help him  

Bring him back  

If you want to help him  

leave him be. 

Can it be done  

There are some with this power. 

 i   How  

  I don t know.  i  

Have you seen it done  

I met a man who came 

back from the dead  

but the priest 

who did it   

it shouldn t have been possible. 

But it was. 

It could be now. 

Not for me. 

Not for you  

I saw you drink poison that 

should have killed you. 

I saw you give birth 

to a demon made of shadows. 

Everything I believed  

the great victory 

I saw in the flames  

all of it was a lie. 

You were right all along. 

The Lord never spoke to me. 

Fuck him  then. 

Fuck all of them. 

I m not a devout man  obviously. 

Seven gods  drowned gods  

tree gods  it s all the same. 

I m not asking the Lord 

of Light for help. 

I m asking the woman who 

showed me that miracles exist. 

I never had this gift. 

Have you ever tried  

Please. 

Burn them all  

Where s my sister  

Burn them all  

Please. 

Burn them. Burn them all  

Burn them all  

Meera. 

They found us. 

I m so sorry. 

Come with me  now. 

The dead don t rest. 

It s so green. 

Oh  yes. 

Once you get south of the Riverlands  

very different sorts of 

trees start to take over. 

Maple  elm  beech  poplar. 

The odd willow. 

And of course now that summer s over  

you ll start seeing the 

autumn colors coming in. 

Still  you ll find more green 

here than anywhere else. 

You re nervous. You re a nervous talker. 

That s not any better 

being a nervous mute. 

I didn t think I d ever come back here 

after my father made 

me renounce my title and inheritance 

and  well  threaten to 

kill me if I didn t. 

A person just doesn t feel 

welcome at that point. 

And I certainly didn t expect to 

be introducing him to my family. 

So you know what to tell them. 

That Little Sam is your baby. 

Yes  now that s very important. 

If he thinks that Little 

Sam is his grandchild  he ll take you in. 

He ll get an education. 

He ll learn to read. 

And you can help teach him. Huh  

What did you tell your family about me  

I told them I met you in the North. 

Did you tell them how far north  

Well  it wasn t a very 

large piece of parchment. 

You didn t tell them 

where I m really from  

You didn t tell them I m a wildling  

The thing is... 

my father doesn t like wildlings. 

He hoped I d make a man of myself 

by  killing some bloody wildlings   

so it s probably a good subject 

to avoid if at all possible. 

I... think we re here. 

Sam. 

Oh  Sam. 

Oh  hello  Mother. 

I never thought I d see you again. 

You look wonderful. 

Talla  

Gods  you re a woman now. 

Father says I have to 

marry Symun Fossoway. 

  He has yellow teeth... 

  That s enough  Talla. 

Oh... Mother  this is Gilly. 

Oh  my. 

You are lovely. 

I am happy to know you  Lady Tarly. 

Oh  and this  

this is our son Samwell. 

Hello  little one. 

It s me  your grandmother. 

May I hold him  

Yes  of course. 

You have a curious mind  I can tell. 

You ll be a scholar like your father. 

Where is Father  

And Dickon  

They re on a hunt. 

They ll join us for dinner. 

Come inside. Such a journey. 

You must be exhausted. 

Come  you ll be wanting a 

bath after all that travel. 

Oh  and a dress for dinner. 

You can wear one of mine. 

What s... what s your color  

Midnight blue or silver  

Silver  maybe. Come. 

You can choose one of my 

bedrooms if you want. 

Is there no other way  

You re afraid for her  

Of course I m afraid for her  

It just seems very dangerous. 

She ll be protected the entire way. 

The Faith Militant are very stern 

with those who overstep their bounds. 

And Queen Margaery isn t your mother. 

I suspect the gods will 

predispose the common people 

to gentleness on her behalf. 

She s truly opened her heart to them. 

She s always been very devoted 

to the poor and the unfortunate. 

And now she s devoted 

to the gods as well. 

Would you like to see her  

Have they hurt you  

Have they mistreated you  

  No  Your Grace. 

  I ve missed you. 

More than you could know. 

We ll be together again soon 

and everything will be 

better than it was before. 

Better how  

Soon the... 

walk of atonement. 

He says there s no other way. 

Have you spoken to him at 

all  the High Sparrow  

Yes  a few times. 

Have you  

Yes  I have. 

He s not quite what we 

thought he was  is he  

You think I m mad. 

I sound mad. 

No. No  you don t. 

You... you could never. 

You re right  he s not. 

He s a lot more... 

He is. 

There s something about him. 

His way of looking at the world. 

It s not an easy thing admitting 

to yourself what you really are. 

It s taken me a while. 

He s helped me. 

What are you talking about  

You re a good person. You ve 

always been a good person. 

You re the best person I know. 

I was just telling him about 

your devotion to the poor. 

Ah  yes  I visited their hovels 

and I fed them soup and I made 

sure I was seen doing it. 

I never gave them what they 

really needed  though. 

I ve had lots of time to think about 

how good I was at seeming good. 

All those stories I told 

myself about who I was 

and why I did the things I did. 

There were so many 

lies in those stories. 

I don t understand. 

It s all right. It really is. 

It s such a relief to 

let go of those lies. 

What about Loras  

I love my brother. 

I will always love my brother. 

His soul is pure and perfect. 

His sins don t erase that purity  

they only obscure it. 

He just needs... to atone for them. 

We all do. 

Sooner or later  one way or another. 

The gods have a plan for us all. 

It s hard to walk in this. 

It s beautiful. 

You re beautiful. 

This venison  it s very tasty. 

Is it from today s hunt  

Well  no. 

We haven t been able 

to cure that one yet. 

This is last week s. 

Oh  of course. Sorry. 

Long journey. 

Brought it down from  yards. 

One shot. 

Oh  that s... that s a fair distance. 

So do you do much 

hunting up at the Wall  

Oh  yes. Yes. 

A good amount. 

North of the Wall  

you don t hunt  you don t eat. 

Mostly deer or is it elk as well  

Rabbits. 

Sometimes squirrels. 

I say  we   it s my friend Jon mostly. 

Sometimes Edd. 

Oh  and Gilly. 

She s... she s quite a 

good hunter as well. 

Huntress. 

I imagine it s common where you re from. 

We once met a man  Lord Umber from 

Last Hearth  wasn t it  Randyll  

who said he taught all his 

daughters how to hunt. 

Your father taught you to hunt  

Our father would never teach us. 

I think our father could learn a 

thing or two from your father. 

That s enough of that. 

Samwell  would you care for more bread  

Oh  yes. Yes  please. 

Thank you  Mother. 

Not fat enough already  

I travelled south under orders 

from the Lord Commander. 

  He wants me to... 

  I read your letter. 

You re to be a maester. 

Yes. 

And once I have my chain  

I ll return to Castle Black. 

I thought the Night s Watch 

might make a man of you. 

Something resembling a man at least. 

You managed to stay soft and fat. 

Your nose buried in books. 

Spending your life reading about 

the achievements of better men. 

I ll wager you still can t sit 

a horse or wield a sword. 

Randyll  to be maester of the 

Night s Watch is a great honor. 

He can wield a sword. 

He killed a Thenn. 

He killed a white walker. 

There s no such thing. 

I saw it with my own eyes on 

our way down to Castle Black. 

He drove a dagger into 

the walker s heart. 

He risked his own life to 

save mine more than once. 

He s a greater warrior than 

either of you will ever be. 

Your way down to Castle Black  

Where did he kill a white walker  

Where are you from  

How d you come to meet my son  

The Night s Watch came to our keep. 

  Where  

  Gilly. 

  North of the Wall. 

  North of the Wall  

You re a wildling. 

The Seven Kingdoms have waged war 

against these savages for centuries 

and here I sit hosting one in my hall 

thanks to my son. 

See that sword  

It s called Heartsbane. 

It s been in our family for  years. 

It s Valyrian steel. 

Only a handful of them 

left in the world. 

It s supposed to go to my 

firstborn son after I die. 

To him. 

He will never wield that sword. 

If he were to become 

Lord Tarly of Horn Hill  

it would be the end of this house. 

I took you for a Mole s 

Town whore when I saw you 

and I made my peace with that. 

Who else would have him  

But I overestimated him. 

No. 

It was a wildling whore 

that seduced my son. 

This you getting back at me  boy  

Bringing that to my table 

and making me dine with it  

And you got what you 

were after  didn t you  

A bastard. A half breed bastard. 

Your invitation into our home. 

Come  my dear. Talla. 

I ve lost my appetite. 

He dishonors us. 

You dishonor yourself. 

Your mother s a fine woman. 

You re not worthy of her. 

To please her  I ll take the wildling 

in. She can work in the kitchens. 

The bastard will be raised here. 

But this will be the last night 

you ever spend at Horn Hill. 

I m sorry I let him treat you that way. 

I was afraid he d turn 

you and Little Sam away. 

I m not angry at you. 

I m angry that horrible people 

can treat good people that 

way and get away with it. 

When do you have to go  

First light. 

Say good bye to him for me. 

You re not what he thinks you are  Sam. 

He doesn t know what you are. 

Good bye  Gilly. 

  Sam  

  We re leaving. 

  What  

  Get your things. 

I don t have any things. 

  What are you doing  

  We belong together. 

All of us. 

What about your mother and sister  

Oh  they ll understand. 

Your sister s dress. 

She won t mind. 

Looks better on you anyway. 

Sam. 

That s your father s sword. 

It s my family s sword. 

Sam. 

Won t he come for it  

He can bloody well try. 

The lion and the rose are one. 

I thank the gods above. 

And to you  my beauteous bride  

I pledge undying love. 

Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery. 

I ll drink a toast to my new queen  

for there is no one fairer. 

Dear Uncle  will you share my 

joy and be my royal cupbearer  

Drink long and deep  my noble king  

from this cup of sweet wine. 

The last drink he shall ever take. 

And vengeance shall be mine. 

Poison  

Murder  

I gasp. I... I die. 

I limp. 

And it was he... 

...that poisoned me. 

My evil Uncle Imp. 

Calm down  dear. 

My firstborn son. 

My golden lion 

foully  falsely slain. 

I pray you found a lasting peace 

free from strife and pain. 

Hear my prayer  O cruel gods. 

Take my life instead. 

For I cannot face another day 

when my sweet boy is dead. 

Oh  woe. 

Oh  grief. 

Oh  darkest day  my heart 

is full of sorrow. 

All hope is lost. 

All joy is gone. 

And there is no tomorrow. 

What is that I hear and smell  

Someone I ll soon send to hell. 

It s time to see if truth they told 

who said Tywin Lannister shits gold. 

You beast. You beast. 

You killed my wife and now 

you ve taken your father s life. 

No worse child ever stained this land. 

Curse the day I named you. 

My greatest crime. Now I must flee. 

Then sail across the Narrow Sea 

to do unto you more treachery. 

Don t fear winter. Fear me  

Thank you. 

Ladies and gentlemen  

I give you Bianca  

Clarenzo. 

I give you Bobono. 

I give you Camello. 

And last but not least  

sweet Lady Crane. 

Give this a good beating. Shake 

those fleas out. That s a dear. 

That crowd was shit. 

Girl. 

What are you doing back here  

Nothing. 

I saw you the other day in the audience. 

How many times have you 

seen this stupid play  

Three times. 

Did you pay  

No. 

I remember when the players 

came to my village. 

I didn t have any money  so I snuck in. 

Just like you. 

Saw the painted faces  the costumes  

listened to the songs  

cried when the young lovers 

died in each other s arms. 

I ran off and joined them the 

next day  never looked back. 

You re very good. 

My final speech is shit. 

But to be fair to myself  

which I always like to be  

the writing s no good. 

So change it. 

It would all just be farting  

belching  and slapping without you. 

How would you change it  

The queen loves her son 

more than anything. 

And he was taken from her 

before she could say good bye. 

She wouldn t just cry. 

She would be angry. 

She would want to kill the 

person who did this to her. 

What s your name  

Mercy. 

You have very expressive eyes  Mercy. 

Wonderful eyebrows. 

Do you like pretending 

to be other people  

I have to go. My 

father s waiting for me. 

Lady Crane  they loved you. 

They were sweet. Or drunk. 

Drunkenly sweet. 

No laugh for Ned s death. 

These people are worse than animals. 

But they loved her. They all love her. 

Yes  you are adored by 

people and animals alike. 

I do what I can with what I m given. 

With what you re given  

Well  I was thinking... 

Oh  we re all thinkers now  are we  

Full to the tits with ideas. 

  I didn t mean... 

  You have ideas  I have ideas  

he has ideas. 

Why should my ideas have 

any more value than yours 

simply because I ve been 

doing this my whole life  

Who is anyone to judge my work  

This is my profession. 

I know what I m doing. 

You have no right to an opinion. 

Careful of that one. 

She wants you dead. 

And  

As I expected. 

A shame. 

A girl had many gifts. 

You promised me. 

Don t let her suffer. 

Company  halt  

My lord. 

My lord. 

My friends  the hour has come. 

Madness has overtaken this city 

and grasped in its claws my children. 

But now we must drive it back 

under the rocks whence it came. 

Madness has had its day  

Forward  march  

Rich or poor  noble or common  

if we sin  we must atone. 

Margaery of House Tyrell 

came to us a sinner. 

She stood before the gods 

in the holy sept and lied. 

She turned a blind eye 

to her brother s sins. 

She disgraced her house  

her king  and herself. 

Company  halt  

Face front  

Turn  

Lord Tyrell. 

Ser Jaime. 

Sorry to interrupt. 

We re here for Queen Margaery 

and Ser Loras Tyrell. 

Give them to us and we ll be on our way. 

I don t have the authority 

to give them to you. 

And you don t have the 

authority to take them. 

That s right. 

Lock spears  

I speak for King Tommen of House 

Baratheon  First of His Name. 

The gods don t recognize his 

authority in this matter. 

You ve already insulted one great house. 

It won t happen twice. 

Every last sparrow will die 

before Margaery Tyrell 

walks down that street. 

To die in the service of the gods 

would please each and every one of us. 

We yearn for it. 

But there is no call for it today. 

There will be no walk of atonement. 

Order up. 

Queen Margaery has already 

atoned for her sins 

by bringing another 

into the true light of the Seven. 

Together we announce 

a new age of harmony. 

A holy alliance 

between the Crown and the Faith. 

Long live King Tommen and 

bless you  Queen Margaery  

The Crown and the Faith 

are the twin pillars upon 

which the world rests. 

Together we will restore the 

Seven Kingdoms to glory. 

What s happening  

He s beaten us. 

That s what s happening. 

When you attack the Faith  

you attack the Crown. 

Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit 

to serve as Lord Commander 

of the Kingsguard. 

I ve been a member of the Kingsguard 

since before you were born. 

You don t have to do this. You 

don t have to do anything. 

I have to answer to the gods. 

Not when you re sitting in that chair. 

The Crown s decision on 

this matter is final. 

Will I be walking naked in the streets  

Or will I spend a few months 

in the sept dungeons first 

to teach me about the gods  mercy  

You have served your house and your 

king faithfully for many years. 

And you will continue to do so. 

But not in this city. 

You ve lost it  

Yes  Father. 

It s a castle  not a bloody sheep. 

Presumably you still know where it is. 

You didn t lose Riverrun. 

You let the Blackfish take it from you. 

He surprised us. He knows the 

castle better than anyone. 

You did lose the Blackfish 

after the Red Wedding. 

You had him right here in this 

hall and you let him leave. 

Then when I told you to 

hunt him down and kill him  

you couldn t find him. 

That s what it means to lose something. 

Now he s come back and taken Riverrun. 

I don t think it s fair to blame us... 

For  years we kissed Tully boots  

swore oaths to them and their 

stinking fish banners. 

Not again. Riverrun is ours. 

Take it back  

We don t have the men. 

We ve got  times as many 

men as the damn Blackfish. 

The Mallisters have risen against us. 

And the Blackwoods. 

The Brotherhood Without Banners is 

rallying the commoners against us  

raiding our supply trains and camps. 

Riverrun can withstand 

a siege for a year. 

If I want excuses  I ll 

put her in charge. 

They re laughing at us. 

All across the Riverlands 

right down to King s Landing  

they re laughing at us. 

I hear it in my sleep  

I m not dead yet  unfortunately for you. 

And I ll not leave this world until 

they all choke on that laughter. 

Take that castle back. 

He ll never yield  Father. 

Oh  he ll yield. 

You ll show him the knife you used 

to kill Robb Stark s child 

in his whore mother s belly  

and you ll show him the knife you used 

to open his niece s throat. 

And you ll remind him who it was 

that got married at the Red 

Wedding in the first place. 

His nephew. 

Cheer up  Lord Edmure. 

You re going home. 

I m being sent to deal 

with the Blackfish. 

Apparently Walder Frey 

can t manage it on his own 

because he s  years old. 

Sent me with an army to the Riverlands 

and a siege that could last months. 

Better you re elsewhere 

at the head of an army 

than in the sept dungeons. 

I m not going to the Riverlands. 

What  then  

I m going to give Bronn the largest 

bag of gold anyone s ever seen 

and have him gather the 

best killers he knows. 

I ll take them to the sept and I ll 

remove the High Sparrow s head 

and every other sparrow head I can find. 

  You can t. 

  He has our son  He stole our son  

He s torn our family apart. 

How should we treat 

people who tear us apart  

We should treat them 

without mercy and we will. 

But if you kill the High Sparrow  

you won t leave the sept alive. 

And without you  this 

is all for nothing. 

Stand at the head of our 

army where you belong  

where Father wanted you. 

Show our men where their 

loyalties belong. 

Show them what Lannisters are  

what we do to our enemies. 

And take that stupid little castle back 

because it s ours and because you can. 

You ll stand trial soon. I 

need to be here for you. 

It will be a trial by combat. 

I have the Mountain. 

They ve made us both 

stronger  all of them. 

They have no idea how strong we are. 

No idea what we re going to do to them. 

We ve always been together. 

We ll always be together. 

We re the only two people in the world. 

Why did you help us  

The Three Eyed Raven sent for me. 

The Three Eyed Raven s dead. 

Now he lives again. 

When I last saw you  you were a boy. 

A fearless boy. 

Loved to climb the castle 

walls  frighten his mother. 

Who are you  

Uncle Benjen. 

The last letter Jon wrote me 

said you had been lost beyond the Wall. 

I led a ranging party 

deep into the North 

to find white walkers. 

They found us. 

A white walker stabbed me in 

the gut with a sword of ice. 

Left me there to die. 

To turn. 

The Children found me. 

Stopped the walker s 

magic from taking hold. 

How  

The same way they made the 

walkers in the first place. 

You saw it yourself. 

Dragonglass. 

A shard of dragonglass 

plunged into your heart. 

You are the Three Eyed Raven now. 

I didn t have time to learn. 

I can t control anything. 

You must learn to control it 

before the Night King comes. 

Drink. 

One way or another  

he will find his way 

to the world of men. 

When he does  

you will be there waiting for him. 

And you will be ready. 

Everything all right  

How many days  ride to Meereen  

A week at best. 

How many ships will I need to 

bring my khalasar to Westeros  

Dothraki and all their horses  

the Unsullied  the Second Sons... 

a   ships easily. 

  Probably more. 

  And who has that many  

Nobody. 

Nobody yet. 

So we ride for Meereen and after 

that we sail for Westeros. 

And what then  

I take what is mine. 

You weren t made to sit 

on a chair in a palace. 

What was I made for  

You re a conqueror  Daenerys Stormborn. 

Wait here. 

My name 

is Grey Worm. 

I come from 

the Summer  Ills.  

Isles. 

Summer Isles. 

 i Summer Isles.  i  

I am from an island 

called Naath. 

When they took you  

 i  When  i  did i  they take me    i  

I was five years old. 

You remember your home  

I remember when they 

rowed us away from shore. 

How white 

the beaches were. 

How tall the trees. 

And I remember 

my village burning. 

Smoke rising 

into the sky. 

Do you remember your home  

Unsullied. 

Always Unsullied. 

Before Unsullied  

nothing. 

That s not true. 

Perhaps one day you will 

return to the Summer Isles. 

I don t want return. 

Kill the masters. 

Kill the masters. 

 i How are the lessons coming   i  

Very well  

Your Grace. 

Missandei is teacher 

good  my queen. 

You ll have 

to continue later. 

It s time. 

Mhysa  Mhysa  Mhysa  

Mhysa  Mhysa  

Mhysa  Mhysa  

Mhysa  Mhysa  

 i Remind me  Ser Jorah   i  

 i how many children did the Great 

Masters nail to mileposts   i  

  Khaleesi. 

Yes  that was it. 

 i Your Grace   i  

 i may I have a word   i  

The city is yours. 

 i All these people   i  

 i they re your subjects now.  i  

Sometimes it is better 

to answer injustice 

with mercy. 

I will answer injustice 

with justice. 

What the hell was that  

That was me knocking 

your ass to the dirt 

with your own hand. 

You re a rare talent. 

When you re fighting 

cripples  anyway. 

You learned to fight 

like a good little boy. 

I ll bet that thrust through the Mad 

King s back was pretty as a picture. 

 i You want to fight pretty  i  

 i or you want to win   i  

You talk to my brother 

this way  

All the time. 

He got used to it. 

Do you think 

he did it  

No. 

Oh  he hated 

the little twat  sure. 

But who didn t  

And poison s 

not his style. 

Or murder  

for that matter. 

You want to know for sure  

why don t you ask him  

You haven t been 

to see him yet  eh  

We re done for today. 

Your brother ever tell you 

how I came into his service  

You stood for him in his trial 

by combat at the Eyrie. 

Aye. 

But only when 

Lady Arryn demanded 

the trial take place 

that day. 

You were his first choice. 

He named you 

for his champion 

because he knew you would ride day 

and night to come fight for him. 

You gonna fight 

for him now  

To tell you the truth  

this isn t so bad. 

Four walls. 

A pot to piss in. 

I was chained 

to a wooden post 

covered in my own 

shit for months. 

Is that supposed 

to make me feel better  

Maybe a bit. 

I m sorry I didn t 

come sooner. 

It s complicated  yes. 

  So how is our sister  

  How do you think  

Her son died in her arms. 

Her son  

Don t. 

You know what s coming  

My trial for regicide. 

Yes  I know. 

I know the whole bloody 

country thinks I m guilty. 

I know that one 

of my three judges 

has wished me dead more 

times than I can count. 

And that judge 

is my father. 

As for Cersei  

well  she s probably 

working on a way 

to avoid a trial altogether 

by having me killed. 

Now that you mention it  

she did ask. 

So  should I turn around 

and close my eyes  

Depends. 

Did you do it  

The Kingslayer brothers. 

You like it  

I like it. 

You re really asking 

if I killed your son  

Are you really asking 

if I d kill my brother  

How can I help you  

Well  you could 

set me free. 

You know I can t. 

Then there s really 

nothing else to say. 

What do you want me to do  

Kill the guards  

Sneak you out of the city 

in the back of a cart  

I m the Lord Commander 

of the Kingsguard. 

Sorry  I d forgotten. 

I d hate for you to do 

something inappropriate. 

Inappropriate  

You re accused of killing the king. 

Freeing you is treason. 

Except I didn t do it. 

Which is why 

we re having a trial. 

A trial. 

If the killer threw himself 

before the Iron Throne  

confessed to his crimes  and gave 

irrefutable evidence of his guilt  

 i it wouldn t matter  i  

 i to Cersei.  i  

She won t rest 

until my head s on a spike. 

Not just yours. 

She s offering a knighthood 

to whomever finds Sansa Stark. 

Sansa couldn t 

have done this. 

She had more reason than 

anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. 

Do you think it s a coincidence she 

disappeared the same night Joffrey died  

No  but... 

Sansa s not a killer. 

Not yet  anyway. 

Where are you taking me  

I m getting married 

to your Aunt Lysa. 

She s waiting for us 

at the Eyrie. 

You ll be safe there. 

Did you kill Joffrey  

Did I kill Joffrey  

I ve been in 

the Vale for weeks. 

I know it was you. 

And who helped me 

with this conspiracy  

Well  there was Ser Dontos. 

You used him to get 

me out of King s Landing  

but you would never trust 

him to kill the king. 

  Why not    Because you re 

too smart to trust a drunk. 

Then perhaps it was 

your husband. 

No. 

 i How do you know   i  

I just do. 

You re right. 

He wasn t involved 

in Joffrey s death. 

But you were. 

 i Do you remember that lovely  i  

 i necklace Dontos gave you   i  

 i I don t suppose you noticed  i  

 i that a stone was missing  i  

 i after the feast.  i  

The poison. 

I don t understand. 

The Lannisters gave you 

wealth  power. 

Joffrey made you 

the Lord of Harrenhal. 

A man with no motive 

is a man no one suspects. 

 i Always keep  i  

 i your foes confused.  i  

If they don t know who 

you are or what you want  

they can t know 

what you plan to do next. 

I don t believe you. 

 i If they catch you  they ll 

put your head on a spike  i  

 i just like my father s.  i  

You d risk that 

just to confuse them  

So many men  

they risk so little. 

They spend their lives 

avoiding danger. 

And then they die. 

I d risk everything 

to get what I want. 

And what do you want  

Everything. 

My friendship with the 

Lannisters was productive. 

But Joffrey  

a vicious boy with 

a crown on his head  

is not a reliable ally. 

And who could trust 

a friend like that  

Who could trust you  

I don t want 

friends like me. 

My new friends 

are predictable. 

Very reasonable people. 

 i As for what  i  

 i happened to Joffrey   i  

well  that was something my new 

friends wanted very badly. 

 i Nothing like  i  

 i a thoughtful gift  i  

 i to make a new friendship  i  

 i grow strong.  i  

I can t believe 

you re going. 

Leaving me alone here 

with these people. 

 i The time has come   i  

 i my dear.  i  

There s nothing 

more tedious than a trial. 

Except perhaps 

these gardens. 

If I have to take one 

more leisurely stroll 

through these gardens  I ll 

fling myself from the cliffs. 

Have you been 

to see Tommen yet  

No. 

Have they even agreed 

to the match  

No one tells me anything. 

I wasn t originally meant to marry 

your grandfather Luthor  you know. 

He was engaged 

to my sister  

your great aunt Viola. 

I was to be given to 

some Targaryen or other. 

Marrying a Targaryen 

was all the rage back then. 

But the moment 

I saw my intended  

with his twitchy 

little ferret s face 

and ludicrous silver hair  

I knew he wouldn t do. 

So the evening 

before Luthor was 

to propose to my sister  

I got lost on my way back 

from my embroidery lesson 

and happened 

upon his chamber. 

  How absentminded of me. 

  Mm hmm. 

The following morning  Luthor 

never made it down the stairs 

to propose to my sister  cause 

the boy couldn t bloody walk. 

And once he could  

the only thing he wanted 

was what I d given him 

the night before. 

I was good. 

I was very  very good. 

You are even better. 

But you need 

to act quickly. 

Cersei may be vicious  

but she s not stupid. 

She ll turn the boy against 

you as soon as she can. 

And by the time you re 

married  it ll be too late. 

Luckily for you  

the Queen Regent 

is rather distracted 

at the moment. 

Mourning her dear 

departed boy. 

Accusing her brother 

of his murder  

which he didn t commit. 

Well  he could have done. 

He could have done  

but he didn t. 

  You don t know  Grandmother. 

  But I do know. 

You don t think I d let you 

marry that beast  do you  

What  

I don t understand. 

Shh. Don t you worry 

yourself about all that. 

You just do 

what needs to be done. 

 i Bring it through   i  

And again. 

Very nice. Good. 

A lot of wildlings fight 

with a weapon in each hand. 

First thing you want to do 

is disarm them to try 

and even the odds. 

Let s see what you can do. 

Olly  you just watch 

for now. 

I can fight. 

Have you ever 

held a sword before  

I was the best archer 

in our hamlet. 

I was  

I believe you. 

We ll go hunting 

for rabbits one day. 

Right now  

watch and learn. 

You two. 

Take it slow  

try and disarm each other. 

You know how to fight. 

You could have gone 

easier on him. 

He wouldn t have learned 

anything that way. 

 i Lord Snow.  i  

What do you think 

you re doing  

Grenn and I were 

helping them. 

Grenn s a ranger. 

You re a steward. 

Maybe you forgot that while you 

were off with your wildling bitch  

but I didn t. 

Someone has 

to train them. 

And that someone 

isn t you. 

Go find a chamber pot 

to empty. 

Go on. Do it. 

You traitor s bastard. 

Give me an excuse. 

Mormont s not here 

to protect you now. 

Get back to work. 

Now  

I said now  

The bastard s well liked. 

You re not. 

You think I care if they like me  

We re at war. 

For now. 

But you can t be 

acting commander forever. 

There will be a choosing. 

The old maester 

will insist on it. 

You might reconsider 

his request to march 

on Craster s. 

Let the mutineers 

take care of Snow. 

Or you might be taking 

orders from him 

the rest of your life. 

A bastard  eh  

Took you for highborn. 

My father was highborn. 

My mother wasn t. 

Name s Locke. 

Jon Snow. 

You fight well. 

What brought you up here  

A sense of duty. 

I wanted to do my part 

for the safety of the realm. 

I was a game warden 

in the Stormlands. 

Fed a prized partridge 

to my hungry kids. 

I was stupid enough 

to get caught. 

Chose the Wall 

over losing my hand. 

Figured I wouldn t have to suck 

up to any highborn cunts here. 

 i Come on  get on with it.  i  

What are you 

waiting for  Summer  

Guess I was wrong. 

You sent for me  

Your Grace  

Your Grace. 

How formal of you. 

How many Kingsguards are 

posted outside Tommen s door  

Ser Boros 

is on duty tonight. 

  Tomorrow I believe   

   i So one   i  

You have one man 

guarding the future king  

I promise you 

Tommen s safe. 

We re protecting him. 

The way you 

protected Joffrey  

Why did Catelyn Stark 

set you free  

  What    I ve been 

wondering for months. 

Ever since that great cow brought 

you back to the capital. 

Why did she 

set you free  

You know why. She d hoped I d 

send her daughters back to her. 

She hoped 

or did you promise  

I swore by all the gods 

that if her daughters were 

alive  I d return them to her. 

So you made a sacred vow 

to the enemy. 

I wanted to get 

back to you. 

Should I have told her 

to fuck off  

You didn t mean it  then  

You have no loyalty 

to Catelyn Stark  

Catelyn Stark s dead. 

So if I told you to leave the 

capital right now and find Sansa  

if I told you to find that 

murderous little bitch 

and bring me her head  

would you do it  

I know you went 

to see Tyrion. 

That creature 

who murdered our son. 

I had to see him. 

I had to know 

for myself. 

And  

He didn t do it  Cersei. 

You ve always pitied him. 

Our poor little brother. 

Abused by the world. 

Despised by his father 

and sister. 

He d kill us all 

if he could. 

I want four men at Tommen s 

door day and night. 

That will be all  

Lord Commander. 

Ser Pounce  

How did you get past 

the Kingsguard  

Kingsguard. 

I don t think you re 

supposed to be here. 

Mother doesn t allow me 

to have visitors at night. 

I m not a visitor  

Your Grace. 

Word has it 

I m to be your bride. 

Did you know that people 

in arranged marriages 

often never meet 

until their wedding day  

Before we decide to spend 

our lives together  

we ought to get 

to know one another. 

Don t you think  

Yes. 

But if my mother 

found out   

It can be our secret. 

Hmm  

If we re going to be 

man and wife  

we ll have a few secrets 

from her  I hope. 

So  Your Grace... 

Yes  

Tell me a secret. 

Hello. Aren t you 

a proper fellow  

That s Ser Pounce. 

Very handsome. 

Joffrey didn t like him. 

He threatened 

to skin him alive 

and mix his innards 

up in my food 

so I wouldn t know 

I was eating him. 

That s very cruel. 

You don t strike me 

as cruel. 

No. 

I don t think I am. 

That s a relief. 

Because you know 

what happens when we marry  

We say our vows in front 

of the high septon. 

And after the ceremony  

there s a feast. 

When we marry  

I become yours. 

Forever. 

It s getting late. 

I should go. 

May I come and visit 

you again  

All right  then. 

Remember  

our little secret. 

 i  Ser Jaime Lannister.  i  

 i Knighted and named to the 

Kingsguard in his  year.  i  

At the sack 

of King s Landing  

murdered his king 

Aerys II. 

Pardoned by 

Robert Baratheon. 

Thereafter known 

as the Kingslayer.  

It s the duty of the Lord 

Commander to fill those pages. 

And there s still room 

left on mine. 

Valyrian steel. 

Mmm. 

It s yours. 

I can t accept this. 

It was reforged 

from Ned Stark s sword. 

You ll use it to defend 

Ned Stark s daughter. 

You swore an oath to return the 

Stark girls to their mother. 

Lady Stark s dead. 

Arya s probably 

dead  too  

but there s still a chance to find 

Sansa and get her somewhere safe. 

I ve got something 

else for you. 

 i I hope I got  i  

 i your measurements right.  i  

I ll find her. 

For Lady Catelyn. 

And for you. 

I almost forgot. 

I have one more gift. 

I don t need a squire. 

Of course you do. 

He ll slow me down. 

My brother owes him a debt. 

He s not safe here. 

You re keeping him from harm. 

It s chivalry. 

I won t 

slow you down  ser   

my lady. 

 i I promise  i  

 i I ll serve you well.  i  

See  He s a good lad. 

You ll get along. 

Compliments of Lord Tyrion. 

His axe from the Blackwater. 

What are you 

waiting for  a kiss  

Ready the lady s horse. 

They say the best swords 

have names. 

Any ideas  

Oathkeeper. 

Good bye  Brienne. 

Come on  move. 

I should never 

have taken her away. 

  She wasn t safe here. 

  She s not safe out there. 

I should have known. 

You told us there were 

wildlings south of the Wall. 

 i If they re raiding the smaller 

villages  Mole s Town could be next.  i  

  Castle Black could be next. 

  I should go back for Gilly. 

We have orders. No one s 

to leave the castle. 

I remember when you disobeyed 

orders and rode south to help Robb. 

And I remember who came after 

me and brought me home. 

I know how hard 

it is  Sam  believe me. 

When you told me about Bran 

going beyond the Wall  

all I could think about was getting my 

strength back so I could go and find him. 

I wish I could have convinced 

him to come back with me. 

I tried. 

Really  I did. 

How fast could they travel  

A crippled boy being pulled 

on a sledge by a simpleton  

I don t know. 

They d pass 

wildling villages. 

They could try to find 

shelter at one of them. 

The wildlings 

have joined up with Mance. 

Every village or sheltered 

place will be deserted. 

Except... 

 i Craster s   i  

You think Bran 

might have found   

Snow. 

I don t mean 

to interrupt. 

Thorne wants to see you. 

Your foray 

to Craster s Keep  

I ll sanction it. 

But I won t order 

anyone to go with you. 

Volunteers only. 

Thank you  Ser Alliser. 

Ahem  brothers. 

I m going beyond the Wall 

to Craster s Keep. 

I m going to capture the mutineers 

holed up there or kill them. 

 i I m asking for volunteers  i  

 i to come with me.  i  

There s  miles of wilderness 

between here and Craster s 

and Mance Rayder has an army 

bearing down on us  

but we have to do this. 

 i Our survival  i  

 i may depend on  i  

 i us getting to these mutineers 

before Mance does.  i  

They know the Wall. 

They know our defenses. 

If Mance learns what 

they know  we re lost. 

But if that s not enough  

then consider this. 

If the Night s Watch 

are truly brothers  

then Lord Commander Mormont 

was our father. 

He lived and died 

for the Watch 

and he was betrayed 

by his own men. 

Stabbed in the back 

by cowards. 

He deserved far better. 

All we can give him now 

is justice. 

Who will join me  

I can t let a recruit 

come north of the Wall. 

Then let me say my vows. 

If it s a fight you re heading for  

then you need men who know how. 

Thank you  brothers. 

 i No  don t.  i  

 i Don t  please.  i  

 i Please don t. Ow   i  

 i You re hurting me.  i  

Karl Tanner 

from Gin Alley 

drinking wine 

from the skull 

of Jeor fucking Mormont. 

Any command for us  

Lord Commander  

What s that  

Fuck  em 

till they re dead  

   i  Did you hear that  boys   i  

Fuck  em 

till they re dead. 

Rast. 

Go outside 

and feed the beast. 

We should kill that thing. 

You should shut 

your fucking hole  

ugly little cunt. 

You look like 

a fucking ballsack. 

Ugly. Look at your 

stupid cunt face. 

I could piss in any gutter 

and soak five of you. 

Know how much they paid me to 

kill a man in King s Landing  

Seven silvers. 

They told me a man s name and that 

man never saw daylight again. 

None of them cocksuckers 

got away from me. 

Haven t lost a fight 

since I was nine. 

Maybe it s time. 

What do you think  eh  

Maybe you re the man. 

Eh  cunt  

I wouldn t stand a chance. 

None of us would. 

I was a fucking legend 

in Gin Alley. 

A fucking legend  

I would take any knight   

any knight  any time. 

Fucking cunts in steel plate. 

Fucking cowards. 

  A gift for the gods. 

  A gift for the gods. 

A gift for the gods. 

What the fuck is that  

Craster s last child. 

A boy. 

What am I supposed 

to do with him  

What did Craster 

do with  em  

Kill  em before they could grow 

up and do the same to him  

All right. 

Don t need another 

mouth to feed. 

  Hand him over. 

  He didn t kill them. 

  He offered them. 

  To who  

To the gods. 

The white walkers. 

  A gift for the gods. 

  A gift for the gods. 

A gift for the gods. 

A gift for the gods. 

A gift for the gods. 

A gift for the gods. 

Shut up  

So... 

if it worked for him... 

Let s give the walkers 

what they want. 

Rast is headed that way. 

Pink eyed fuck. 

You thirsty  

Fuck  

Hodor. 

Do you hear that  

Is that a baby  

It s coming. 

I m going out there. 

No  we need 

to stay together. 

I m going. 

  Bran. Bran. 

  Hodor. Hodor. 

  Hodor. 

  Bran  what happened  

Summer  he s hurt. They ve 

caught him in a trap. 

Who  

I didn t see  but they 

have my brother s wolf. 

They have Ghost. 

 i They re Night s Watch.  i  

Look. 

 i Jon might be here.  i  

If Jon was here  why would 

they put his wolf in a cage  

They might have been Night s 

Watch once  not anymore. 

We re not safe here. 

We need to go. 

No. 

Bran  we need to go now. 

I m not leaving 

without Summer. 

Can you remember 

where the cage was  

The east side 

of the keep. 

If I m not back 

soon  we ll meet   

Hodor. 

Hodor. 

Hodor. 

Hodor. 

Hodor. 

If I was your size  I d be 

king of the fucking world. 

Help him up. 

This is nice. 

Fine leather. 

You re no wildling. 

Important. Highborn. 

Who are you  

You see  

where I come from  

a commoner like me slaps 

a little lord like you  

I d lose my right hand. 

But we re a long way 

from home  aren t we  

And the two of you  

fancy looking folks 

north of the Wall 

creeping through 

the woods. 

Isn t that a bit odd  

I like your curly hair. 

My mom had curls 

like that. 

Beautiful brown curls. 

Why d you drag a crippled 

boy all the way up here  

See you haven t played 

this game before. 

A highborn hostage  

 i that s valuable.  i  

But three of them  

that s a lot 

of mouths to feed. 

 i   What the fuck s wrong with him   i  

  Come here. 

No  please. 

Please. 

Please  let me help him. 

  Who are you  

  Please. 

  Who are you  

  I m Brandon Stark  

I m Brandon Stark 

of Winterfell. 

It s Jon Snow s brother. 

It s Meera. It s Meera. 

I m right here. 

And I thought this was gonna 

be another boring day. 

 i I m right here.  i  

  wind howling   

  panting   

  breathing heavily   

Brother  

  snow crunching   

  Ghost snarling   

Did you send the ravens  

Tarly  look at me. 

Did you send the ravens  

 i That was your job.  i  

Your only job. 

We need to get 

back to the Wall. 

 i It s a long march.  i  

 i We know what s out there   i  

but we have to make it  

have to warn them 

or before winter s done  

everyone you ve ever known 

will be dead. 

  wind blowing   

  people talking indistinctly   

First time you ve seen 

a giant  Jon Snow  

Well  don t stare too long. 

They re shy. 

When they stop being shy  

they get angry. 

And when they re angry  

I ve seen them pound a man 

straight into the ground 

like a hammer on a nail. 

  growling   

  Man   i Crow   i  

  Boy   i Crow   i  

  Girl   i Look over there   i  

  Man     i Crow   i  

Girl   i Crow  Look over here  

Look   i  

Woman  

 i Ah  look  crow coming   i  

Boy  

 i Crow   i  

Ygritte  You re wearing 

the wrong color. 

Mance was a ranger. 

In your hearts  all you 

crows want to fly free. 

When I m free  

will I be free to go  

  Crow  

  Crow  

Sure  you will. 

  Oh  

    laughter   

And I ll be free to kill you. 

 i Got no respect  this lot.  i  

Got no fathers to slap  em 

when they re foul. 

What happened to their fathers  

Some of them were killed 

by crows like you. 

Don t look so grim  Jon Snow. 

If Mance Rayder likes you  

you ll live another day. 

And if he don t... 

I smell a crow. 

We killed his friends. 

Thought you d want 

to question this one. 

What do we want 

with a baby crow  

This baby killed 

Qhorin Halfhand. 

 i He wants to be one of us.  i  

That half handed cunt 

killed friends of mine. 

Friends twice your size. 

My father told me big men fall 

just as quick as little ones 

 i if you put a sword  i  

 i through their hearts.  i  

Plenty of little men 

tried to put their swords 

through my heart. 

And there s plenty 

of little skeletons 

 i buried in the woods.  i  

   i What s your name  boy   i  

  Jon Snow. 

Your Grace. 

  laughter   

  Your Grace  

    laughter   

Did you hear that  

From now on  you d better 

kneel every time I fart. 

  laughs   Stand  boy. 

We don t kneel for anyone 

beyond the Wall. 

So  you re Ned Stark s bastard. 

Thank you for the gift  

Lord of Bones. 

You can leave us. 

The girl likes you. 

You like her back  Snow  

That why you want to join us  

Bearded warrior  

 i Don t panic  boy.  i  

This isn t the damned 

Night s Watch 

where we make you 

swear off girls. 

This chicken eater you thought 

was king is Tormund Giantsbane. 

Can t believe this pup 

 i killed the Halfhand.  i  

He was our enemy 

and I m glad he s dead. 

He was my brother once. 

Back when he had a whole hand. 

What were you doing with him  

The Lord Commander sent me 

to the Halfhand for seasoning. 

Why  

He wants me to lead one day. 

But here you are  a traitor 

kneeling before 

the King beyond the Wall. 

If I m a traitor  

then you are  too. 

Why do you want 

to join us  Jon Snow  

I want to be free. 

No  I don t think so. 

I think what you want 

most of all 

is to be a hero. 

I ll ask you 

one last time   

why do you want to join us  

We stopped at Craster s 

Keep on the way north. 

I saw... 

You saw what  

I saw Craster take 

his own baby boy 

and leave it in the woods. 

I saw what took it. 

You re telling me 

you saw one of them  

And why would that make you 

desert your brothers  

Because when I told 

the Lord Commander  

he already knew. 

Thousands of years ago  

the First Men 

battled the White Walkers 

and defeated them. 

I want to fight for the side 

that fights for the living. 

Did I come to the right place  

We ll need to find you 

a new cloak. 

  children chattering   

What if you took off 

that bit there  

Don t you want to leave 

something to the imagination  

Trouble is  I ve never 

had much imagination. 

I want you to take it off. 

  tsks   

Mouth. 

 i   door opens  closes    i  

Podrick  Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn. 

I didn t hear that. 

  Apologies  ser. 

  Bronn   i Back away.  i  

Keep backing away till you re 

outside this establishment. 

  Then back away some more. 

  Lord Tyrion sent me. 

I will murder you  boy. 

He said it was a matter 

of life and death. 

 i   knocking    i  

  Pod  

  Cersei   i It s your sister.  i  

 i The queen.  i  

 i What are they doing here   i  

Protecting me  I assume. 

Will you let me in  

No  I don t think so. 

If I wanted to kill you  

do you think 

I d let a wooden door stop me  

They stay outside. 

I m not afraid of you  

little brother. 

  Why are you here  

  I wanted to see your face. 

They said you d lost your nose  but 

it s not as gruesome as all that. 

The man who cut me 

lost more than his nose. 

I should hope so. 

The rebels came for Joffrey s 

head  they lost their own. 

Thanks to Father. 

Thanks to Father. 

Of course  it wasn t a rebel 

who tried to kill me. 

No  Curious. 

Bit of a comedown 

from chamber of the Hand. 

But then I don t suppose 

you need much room. 

Grand Maester Pycelle 

made the same joke. 

You must be proud to be as funny as 

a man whose balls brush his knees. 

You re meeting Father today  

How do you know that  

 i Because I have hundreds  i  

 i of spies in my employ.  i  

The Master of Whisperers 

owes me a favor or two. 

Father told me. 

What do you want from him  

What do I want from him  

He s my father. 

Do I need to want something  

I m sure he loves me dearly  

as any father loves his child  

his baby boy. 

Yet he hasn t come 

to visit once 

 i since arriving  i  

 i in King s Landing.  i  

 i I lay here   i  

 i my face split in half   i  

but Father never came. 

You re going to make me cry. 

Why do you care 

what I want from him  

Because you ve slandered me 

to Father before. 

Slandered  

When  

 i You told him I had my guards  i  

beat that servant girl 

at Casterly Rock. 

 i You did have  i  

 i your guards beat her.  i  

A girl of nine  I believe. 

 i I was nine  too.  i  

She lost an eye  

if I remember correctly. 

If I remember correctly  

she never stole 

a necklace again. 

It s not slander if it s true. 

And what s this truth 

you plan on telling him today  

 i Why are you so nervous  i  

 i about what I m going  i  

 i to say to Father   i  

Because you re a liar. 

I expect you ll tell lies 

about me  about Joffrey. 

Any lies in particular  

You re a clever man  

but you re not half as clever 

as you think you are. 

Still makes me 

more clever than you. 

 i   door opens    i  

Oh  look at these two 

shining warriors. 

Ser Taryn Mant and... 

Ser Whosit of Whocares. 

Ser Meryn Trant. 

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. 

  You re no knight. 

  Pod. 

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater 

was anointed 

by the king himself. 

You re an up jumped 

cutthroat  

nothing more. 

That s exactly who I am. 

And you re a grub 

in fancy armor 

 i who s better at beating little 

girls than fighting men.  i  

Now  I have an appointment 

with Lord Tyrion. 

You put your hand on that door  

you lose the hand. 

As much as I appreciate a walk 

in the sunshine  your lordship  

I am wondering 

why you sent for me. 

A number of people 

in this city want to kill me. 

You re here to protect me. 

I ve been doing that 

for a while now. 

Do you grow bored 

protecting me  

I grow poor protecting you. 

Poor  

Poor  

Under my patronage 

you ve become a knight  

you ve served as Commander 

of the City Watch. 

  Briefly. 

  I m sure you filled your pockets. 

And now my pockets are empty. 

You ve given me a taste 

for the finer things. 

And if you want me 

to carry on protecting you  

you ll need to pay more. 

  I thought we were friends. 

  We are. 

But I m a sellsword. 

I sell my sword. 

I don t loan it out 

to friends as a favor. 

  How much  

  Double. 

  Double  

  I m a knight now. 

Knights are worth double. 

I don t even know how much 

I m paying you now. 

Which means you can afford it. 

    breathing heavily   

   i   waves lapping    i  

  seabirds calling   

Here. Here  

Help me  

 i   horn blowing    i  

Who are you  

I was in the battle 

at Blackwater. 

I was a captain and a knight. 

Aye  ser  

and serving which king  

The one true king 

of Westeros   

Stannis Baratheon. 

I thought you were dead. 

Everyone thought you were dead. 

And your son  

He may have swam 

ashore as you did. 

No  the wildfire took him. 

I saw it. 

I m so sorry  my friend. 

I  too  have lost a son. 

There is nothing worse 

in this world. 

But  Davos  you were 

a good father. 

If I was a good father  

he d still be here. 

Stannis lives  

He licks his wounds 

at Dragonstone. 

Will you take me there  

There is nothing for me 

at Dragonstone. 

This war is not over. 

Not for you  maybe. 

But for Salladhor Saan  

the war is over. 

We re both sworn 

to King Stannis. 

I am sworn to no man. 

I promised you  ships and you 

promised me riches and glory. 

I delivered the ships. 

Stannis never gives up. 

Never. 

  Now he will regroup   

   i He s a broken man.  i  

His fleet lies at the bottom 

of Blackwater Bay. 

They say he sees no one   

not his generals  

not even his wife. 

Only the Red Woman 

whispering in his ear  

telling him what 

she sees in the flames 

and burning men alive. 

What  

They built a great fire 

when Stannis returned. 

All those who spoke 

against her she called 

servants of darkness. 

They say she sang 

to them as they burned. 

I m a pirate. 

 i You re a smuggler.  i  

 i Servants of darkness.  i  

I m thinking Dragonstone is a 

good place for us to avoid. 

Take me back there  please. 

You cannot turn 

Stannis against her. 

Maybe not  but I could 

carve her heart out. 

You could try. 

If you fail  

they will burn you. 

If you succeed  

they ll burn you. 

And you ve only 

just come back to life. 

Stay alive a little 

longer  my friend. 

You call me friend. You drank 

with me on my wedding day. 

And you drank with me 

on four of my wedding days  

but I don t ask you for favors. 

I have to stop her. 

Please  do this for me. 

When you are dead  

I will gather your bones 

in a little sack 

and let your widow 

wear them around her neck. 

We should set the siege lines 

  yards from Harrenhal. 

There won t be a siege. The 

Mountain can t defend a ruin. 

I imagine the Mountain 

will defend 

whatever Tywin Lannister 

tells him to defend. 

The Lannisters have been 

running from us since Oxcross. 

I d love a fight. 

The men would love a fight. 

I don t think 

we re going to get one. 

 i   flies buzzing    i  

 Northmen 

slaughtered like sheep. 

The debt will be 

repaid  my friend. 

For them and for your sons. 

Will it  

They rot in the ground 

 i while their killer runs free.  i  

The Kingslayer won t 

remain free for long. 

My best hunters are after him. 

  Robb   i A Mallister   i  

  Ser Jeremy. 

My father s bannerman. 

Find her a chamber 

that will serve as a cell. 

Talisa  

 i She s your mother.  i  

She freed Jaime Lannister. 

The Lannisters robbed 

them of their sons 

and she robbed them 

of their justice. 

  coughing   

 i Water.  i  

Water. 

This needs to be 

cleaned and closed. 

What s your name  friend  

Qyburn. 

You re lucky to be alive. 

Lucky  

 i   birds cawing    i  

  sighs   

The badge looks good on you. 

Almost as good 

as it looked on me. 

Are you enjoying 

your new position  

Am I enjoying it  

I was very happy 

as Hand of the King. 

  chuckles   Yes. 

I heard how happy you were. 

  blows   

You brought a whore 

into my bed. 

It wasn t your bed at the time. 

I sent you here 

to advise the king. 

I gave you real power 

and authority. 

You chose to spend your days 

as you always have  

bedding harlots 

and drinking with thieves. 

Occasionally I drank 

with the harlots. 

What do you want  Tyrion  

Why does everyone assume 

I want something  

Can t I simply visit 

with my beloved father  

My beloved father who 

somehow forgot to visit 

his wounded son 

after he fell 

on the battlefield. 

Maester Pycelle assured me 

your wounds were not fatal. 

I organized 

the defense of this city 

while you held court 

in the ruins of Harrenhal. 

I led the foray when the 

enemies were at the gate 

while your grandson  the king  

quivered in fear 

behind the walls. 

I bled in the mud 

for our family. 

And as my reward  

I was trundled off 

to some dark little cell. 

But what do I want  

A little bloody gratitude 

would be a start. 

Jugglers and singers 

require applause. 

You are a Lannister. 

 i Do you think I demanded  i  

 i a garland of roses  i  

 i every time I suffered  i  

 i a wound on a battlefield   i  

Hmm  

Now  I have seven kingdoms 

to look after 

and three of them 

are in open rebellion. 

So tell me what you want. 

I want what is mine by right. 

Jaime is your eldest son  

heir to your lands and titles. 

But he is a Kingsguard  forbidden 

from marriage or inheritance. 

The day Jaime put on 

the white cloak  

he gave up his claim 

to Casterly Rock. 

I am your son and lawful heir. 

You want Casterly Rock  

It is mine by right. 

  sighs   

We ll find you accommodations 

more suited to your name 

 i and as a reward  i  

 i for your accomplishments  i  

during the battle 

of Blackwater Bay. 

And when the time is right  

you will be given a position 

 i fit for your talents  i  

so that you can 

serve your family 

and protect our legacy. 

 i And if you serve faithfully   i  

 i you will be rewarded  i  

 i with a suitable wife.  i  

And I would let myself 

be consumed by maggots 

 i before mocking the family name  i  

 i and making you  i  

 i heir to Casterly Rock.  i  

  Why  

  Why  

You ask that  

You  who killed your mother 

to come into the world  

You are an ill made  

spiteful little creature 

full of envy  lust  

and low cunning. 

 i Men s laws give you  i  

 i the right to bear my name  i  

and display my colors since I 

cannot prove that you are not mine. 

 i And to teach me humility   i  

 i the gods have condemned me  i  

to watch you waddle about 

wearing that proud lion 

that was my father s sigil 

and his father s before him. 

But neither gods nor men 

will ever compel me 

to let you turn Casterly Rock 

 i into your whorehouse.  i  

Go  now. 

Speak no more of your rights 

to Casterly Rock. 

Go. 

Oh  one more thing. 

The next whore I catch 

in your bed I ll hang. 

Sansa   i Dorne.  i  

 i It s going to Dorne.  i  

  Shae   i Why Dorne   i  

  It s carrying silk 

and it s supposed to bring 

back wine in exchange. 

But it s not coming back. 

The captain s tired 

of risking his life 

so King s Landing 

lords and ladies 

can get drunk on better 

wine than they deserve. 

He s going to stay in Dorne. 

Wait out the winter where 

it s beautiful and warm. 

I met some people in Dorne who 

weren t so beautiful and warm. 

Don t ruin the game. 

I told you  

I don t want to play. 

What about that one there  

That one  

It s going to Volantis. 

Why  

Because when I got 

on a ship in Volantis  

it looked like that one. 

That s not how the game works. 

You re not supposed to just 

blurt out the right answer. 

You ve got to invent a story 

about where the ship 

is going and why. 

Why should I make up a story 

when I know the truth  

Because the truth 

is always either 

terrible or boring. 

Lovely day for it. 

Watching the ships. 

Lord Baelish. 

Might I speak with Lady Sansa 

alone for a moment  

I saw your mother not long ago. 

She s very eager to see you. 

And your sister. 

Arya s alive  

You said you d take me home. 

You said King s Landing 

was your home. 

You are the property 

of the crown. 

Stealing you would be treason. 

If you were to tell 

just one person   

  I won t tell anyone. 

  How do I know  

Because I m a terrible liar. 

You said so yourself. 

Please  Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. 

Tell me when. 

I m waiting for word 

on an assignment 

that will take me far away 

from the capital. 

When I set sail  

I might be able 

to take you with me. 

But you ll need to be ready to 

leave on a moment s notice. 

You re her handmaiden  

Yes. 

And you re his...  

I help manage his affairs. 

  He s an important person. 

  So is she. 

I grew up in the shadow 

of her father s castle. 

The day she was born  

they rang the bells 

from sunrise till sunset. 

We ve both done 

rather well  you and I. 

Yes. 

Given where we started. 

And where is that  

It s not easy for girls like us 

to dig our way out. 

Ros  

 i Watch out for her.  i  

I always do. 

Watch out for her with him. 

 i   dragon screeching    i  

  screeches   

  screeches   

  screeching   

They re growing fast. 

Not fast enough. 

I can t wait that long. 

I need an army. 

 i   dragon screeching    i  

We ll be in Astapor 

by nightfall. 

Some say the Unsullied are the 

greatest soldiers in the world. 

The greatest slave soldiers 

in the world. 

The distinction means 

a good deal to some people. 

Do those people 

have any better ideas 

about how to put you 

on the Iron Throne  

It s too beautiful 

a day to argue. 

 i   man vomiting    i  

You re right. 

Another lovely day 

on the high seas. 

Daenerys  

 i Don t mock them.  i  

They re the first Dothraki 

who have ever been on a ship. 

They followed me 

across the poison water. 

If they ll do it  others will. 

And with a true 

khalasar   

The Dothraki follow strength 

above all  khaleesi. 

You ll have a true khalasar 

when you prove yourself strong. 

And not before. 

 i   seabirds calling    i  

Your Grace. 

I heard you were dead. 

Not yet. 

I had hoped to speak 

to you alone  Your Grace. 

We are alone. 

Your Grace  you are 

the rightful king. 

 i Not only by blood.  i  

You re an honorable man  

a just man. 

And there is still 

a war to fight. 

I am fighting. 

By burning prisoners alive  

How would you punish 

the infidels  Ser Davos  

I do not judge people 

for the gods they worship. 

If I did  I d have 

thrown you in the sea 

before you ever set foot 

on Dragonstone. 

  I m not your enemy. 

  You are my enemy. 

Was it me you fought 

on Blackwater Bay  

 i Did I set your ships ablaze   i  

I wasn t there when the wildfire 

killed our men by the thousands. 

I could have saved those men. 

You would have taken the city  

Stannis would now sit 

upon his rightful throne  

and you would stand beside him. 

 i But I wasn t there  i  

because you convinced 

your king to leave me behind. 

Do you hear them screaming  

All those burning men 

in the water 

crying for their mothers  

for their gods for help  

Until the moment 

the Blackwater swallowed them. 

  gasps   

Don t despair  Ser Davos. 

What I told your son is true. 

Death by fire 

is the purest death. 

  growls   

This woman is evil  

She s the mother of demons. 

Take him to the dungeon 

and lock him in a cell. 

  Your Grace  

  Come on. 

You ve chosen 

the darkness  Ser Davos. 

  She will destroy us all  

  I will pray for you. 

Davos

Guard  

 i Halt. Down.  i  

Guard    

 i Halt. Down.  i  

Why have we stopped  

It s Lady Margaery  Your Grace. 

Joffrey   i What is she doing  

Who gave her permission   i  

Maid  My lady. We should 

have guards  my lady. 

Why  

Pardon me. 

Stop  my lady. 

You ll ruin your dress. 

I have others. 

Would you like to speak 

with her  Your Grace  

No. 

He was a soldier. 

He went to fight on the walls 

when the ships came 

into Blackwater Bay. 

He never came back. 

And your mother  

She died when she had me. 

Bad men wanted 

to come into this city 

and do terrible things  

but your father stopped them. 

Whenever you look 

at this knight  

I want you to remember 

your father. 

He wasn t a knight. 

He was just a soldier. 

And what do knights 

swear to do  

Protect the weak 

and uphold the good. 

Your father did that. 

Be proud of him. 

Was your father a soldier  too  

You should be proud  too. 

Under King Joffrey s 

leadership  

your fathers saved the city. 

They saved us all. 

From now on  we re going 

to take care of you. 

All of you. 

  children laughing   

Come to me for whatever 

you need to feed them  

clothe them  or house them. 

Directly to me. 

 i   doors open    i  

  Your Grace. 

  Your Grace. 

Please  sit. 

Sit. 

I do apologize  my lady. 

Small council meetings. 

At what point 

does it become treason 

to waste the king s time  

  laughs   

That s a lovely gown  my lady. 

Yes  it suits you perfectly. 

I imagine you might 

be rather cold. 

The climate is a bit more forgiving 

back in Highgarden  Your Grace. 

Shall I have them bring 

you a shawl  my lady  

I am touched by your 

concern  Your Grace. 

Luckily for us Tyrells  

our blood runs quite warm. 

   i Doesn t it  Loras   i  

  Yes. 

Loras  isn t the queen s 

gown magnificent  

The fabric  the embroidery  

the metalwork. 

I ve never seen 

anything like it. 

You might find a bit 

of armor quite useful 

once you become queen. 

Perhaps before. 

 i Joffrey tells me you stopped 

your carriage at Flea Bottom  i  

on your way back from 

the sept this morning. 

Yes. I paid a visit 

to an orphanage 

the High Septon told me about. 

Margaery does a great deal of work 

with the poor back in Highgarden. 

The lowest among us are no different from 

the highest if you give them a chance 

and approach them 

with an open heart. 

Cersei   i An open heart is what 

you ll get in Flea Bottom  i  

 i if you re not careful  my dear.  i  

Not long ago  we were 

attacked by a mob there. 

We had a full complement 

of guards that didn t stop them. 

The king barely escaped 

with his life. 

My mother s always had 

a penchant for drama. 

Facts become less and less 

important to her 

 i as she grows older.  i  

Our lives were never 

truly in danger. 

You re right  of course. 

But you are your father s son. 

We can t all have 

a king s bravery. 

Hunger turns men into beasts. 

I m glad House Tyrell has been 

able to help in this regard. 

They tell me  wagons arrive 

daily now from the Reach. 

 i Wheat  barley  apples.  i  

 i We ve had a blessed harvest.  i  

And  of course  it s our 

duty to assist the capital 

in time of need. 

Well  as Ser Loras said  

Lady Margaery has done 

this sort of... 

charitable work before. 

I m sure she knows 

what she s doing. 

I m sure she does. 

  speaking Valyrian   

The Unsullied have stood here 

for a day and a night 

with no food or water. 

  speaking Valyrian   

They will stand 

until they drop. 

  speaking Valyrian   

Such is their obedience. 

They may suit my needs. 

Tell me of their training. 

They begin their 

training at five. 

Every day they drill 

from dawn to dusk 

until they have mastered 

the shortsword  

the shield  

and the three spears. 

Only one boy in four survives 

this rigorous training. 

  speaking Valyrian   

Missandei   i Their discipline 

and loyalty are absolute.  i  

 i They fear nothing.  i  

Even the bravest men 

fear death. 

  continues in Valyrian   

Missandei   i My master says 

the Unsullied are not men.  i  

Death means nothing to them. 

He begs you attend to this 

carefully  Your Grace. 

  speaking Valyrian   

Tell the good master 

there is no need. 

Missandei   i My master points out 

that men don t need nipples.  i  

  speaking Valyrian   

To win his shield  

an Unsullied must go to the 

slave marts with a silver mark  

find a newborn and kill it 

before its mother s eyes. 

 i This way  my master says   i  

 i we make certain  i  

 i there is no weakness  i  

 i left in them.  i  

You take a babe 

from its mother s arms  

kill it as she watches  and pay 

for her pain with a silver coin  

  speaking Valyrian   

  continues in Valyrian   

My master would like you to 

know that the silver is paid 

to the baby s owner  

not the mother. 

How many do you have to sell  

 i   Missandei speaking Valyrian    i  

 . 

Master Kraznys asks 

that you please hurry. 

Many other buyers 

are interested. 

  dead babies. 

The Unsullied 

are a means to an end. 

Once I own them  

these men   

They re not men. 

Not anymore. 

Once I own an army of 

slaves  what will I be  

Do you think these slaves 

will have better lives 

serving Kraznys and men 

like him or serving you  

You ll be fair to them. 

You won t mutilate them 

to make a point. 

You won t order them 

to murder babies. 

You ll see they re properly 

fed and sheltered. 

A great injustice 

has been done to them. 

Closing your eyes 

will not undo it.

You know this man  

I know him 

as one of the greatest fighters 

the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen 

and as the Lord Commander 

of Robert Baratheon s 

Kingsguard. 

King Robert is dead. 

I have been searching 

for you  Daenerys Stormborn  

to ask your forgiveness. 

I was sworn to protect 

your family. 

I failed them. 

I am Barristan Selmy  

Kingsguard to your father. 

 i Allow me to join  i  

 i your Queensguard  i  

and I will not fail you again. 

 i The fist of the First Men.  i  

Thousands of years ago  

the First Men stood here. 

They came here to get 

away from something. 

And I don t think it worked. 

Your sword. 

 i The Kingslayer   i  

 i he escaped in the night.  i  

How  

Jaime Lannister has 

played you for a fool. 

Sansa and Arya are captives 

in King s Landing. 

 i Returning him may buy  i  

 i life for my children.  i  

A girl owes one more name. 

Give a man a name. 

  Jaqen H ghar. 

  A girl gives a man his own name  

I ll un name you if you help 

me and my friends escape. 

 i A girl and her friends will  i  

 i walk through the gate at midnight.  i  

 i Who was that out there  i  

 i hung up at the gates   i  

Must have been 

the farmer s boys. 

 i Killed them  burned them   i  

 i and passed them off  i  

 i as the little lords   i  

Got as far as the farm 

then doubled back. 

Hoped this would be the last 

place they d think to look. 

My bastard is only a few 

days from Winterfell. 

  Once he captures the castle   

  Theon has my brothers. 

  If we storm the castle   

  he wouldn t dare hurt the boys. 

There is only hope of escaping 

the North with his head. 

Send word to your son. 

Any Ironborn 

who surrender will be allowed 

to return safely 

to their homes. 

With the exception 

of Theon Greyjoy. 

I expect his countrymen will turn on 

him the minute they hear the offer. 

Mance is gonna march 

on the wall. 

When he does  

one brother inside his army 

will be worth   

fighting against him. 

  They ll never trust me. 

  They might. 

  If you do what needs to be done. 

  What  

I should have known better  

trusting a traitor s bastard  

He s not yours 

to kill  crow. 

I don t want to marry 

the Frey girl. 

I don t want you 

to marry her. 

If you enter that place  

you will never leave again. 

If my dragons are in 

the House of the Undying  

then take me there. 

That s what 

the warlock wants. 

  His magic is strong. 

  And what of my magic  

They re coming ashore. 

There are too many. 

Rain fire on them. 

The battle is over. 

We have won.

and the Hand of the King. 

Thank you  Your Grace. 

Lord Petyr Baelish  

step forward. 

For your good service 

and ingenuity 

in uniting the Houses 

of Lannister and Tyrell  

 i I declare that you shall be granted  i  

 i the castle of Harrenhal...  i  

 i With all its attendant  i  

 i lands and incomes  i  

 i to be held by your sons  i  

 i and grandsons  i  

from this day until 

the end of time. 

You honor me 

beyond words  Your Grace. 

I shall have to acquire 

some sons and grandsons. 

Ser Loras Tyrell. 

Your House has come 

to our aid. 

The whole realm 

is in your debt  

none more so than I. 

If your family would ask 

anything of me  ask it 

and it shall be yours. 

Your Grace  

my sister Margaery  

her husband was taken 

from us before... 

She remains innocent. 

I would ask you to 

find it in your heart 

to do us the great honor 

of joining our Houses. 

Is this what you want  

Lady Margaery  

With all my heart  

Your Grace. 

I have come to love 

you from afar. 

Tales of your 

courage and wisdom 

 i have never been  i  

 i far from my ears.  i  

And those tales have taken 

root deep inside of me. 

Well  I too have heard tales 

of your beauty and grace  

 i but the tales  i  

do not do you justice  

My Lady. 

 i It would be an honor  i  

 i to return your love   i  

but I am promised 

to another. 

A King must keep 

his word. 

Your Grace  in the judgment 

of your small council  

it would be neither 

proper nor wise 

for you to wed the daughter 

of a man beheaded for treason  

a girl whose brother 

is in open rebellion 

against the throne 

as we speak. 

For the good 

of the realm  

your councilors 

beg you... 

to set Sansa Stark aside. 

  Margaery  

  We want Margaery  

 i I would like to heed  i  

 i your wishes  i  

 i and the wishes  i  

 i of my people   i  

but I took 

a holy vow. 

 i Your Grace   i  

the Gods do indeed 

hold betrothal solemn  

but your father  

blessed be his memory  

made this pact 

before the Starks 

revealed their falseness. 

 i I have consulted  i  

 i with the High Septon  i  

and he assures me that their 

crimes against the realm 

 i free you from any promise  i  

 i you have made to them  i  

 i in the sight  i  

 i of the Gods.  i  

The Gods are good. 

I am free 

to heed my heart. 

 i Ser Loras  I will gladly  i  

 i wed your sweet sister.  i  

 i You will be my Queen  i  

and I will love you 

from this day 

until my last day. 

My Lady. 

 i My sincerest condolences.  i  

They re right   

I m not good enough for him. 

You shouldn t say that. 

You ll be good enough 

for many things. 

He ll still enjoy 

beating you. 

And now that 

you re a woman  

he ll be able to enjoy you 

in other ways as well. 

But if he s not 

marrying me   

He ll let you go home  

Joffrey s not the sort of boy 

who gives away his toys. 

You have a tender heart  

just like your mother 

did at your age. 

I can see so much 

of her in you. 

She was like 

a sister to me. 

For her sake  

I ll help get you home. 

King s Landing 

is my home now. 

Look around you. 

We re all liars here. 

And every one of us 

is better than you. 

Come in. 

Make yourself 

comfortable. 

That doesn t look 

very comfortable. 

Here  watch me. 

No need for that  

my dear. 

You sure  

Most men like 

what they see. 

I m not like 

most men. 

 i That s what most men say.  i  

If you don t want 

what most men want  

then you d better tell me 

what you d like me to do. 

I would like you to tell me 

if working for Lord Baelish 

has been all you d 

hoped it would be. 

Have we met  

You wouldn t 

remember me if we had  

I meet a lot of men. 

And I think you 

remember all of them. 

I think your true talents 

are wasted on them. 

You re very kind  

My Lord. 

Allow me to return 

the favor. 

You re afraid. 

Why  

Nothing dangerous down there. 

I know who you are. 

And  unlike your 

current employer  

I protect those 

who work for me. 

I don t abuse them 

to satisfy royal whims 

or force them 

to abuse each other. 

How do you know 

about that  

I thought you said 

you knew who I was. 

What can I do for you  

Lord Varys  

Littlefinger looks at you 

and sees a collection 

of profitable holes. 

I see a potential 

partner. 

  I m afraid of him. 

  Oh  you should be. 

He s a dangerous man. 

But everyone has 

their weaknesses. 

Your current employer 

hides his very well  

but not as well 

as he thinks. 

You re a virgin  

I take it  

Walk. 

Childhood must have 

been awful for you. 

Were you a foot taller 

than all the boys  

They laughed at you  

called you names  

Some boys 

like a challenge. 

One or two must have 

tried to get inside big Brienne. 

  One or two tried. 

  Ah. 

But you fought them off. 

But maybe you wished one 

of them could overpower you  

fling you down  

tear off your clothes. 

But none of them 

were strong enough. 

  I m strong enough. 

  Not interested. 

Of course you are. 

You d love to know what it 

feels like to be a woman. 

 i Ah.  They lay  i  

 i with lions.   i  

Tavern girls  I d say. 

Probably served 

my father s soldiers. 

Maybe one of them 

gave up a kiss and a feel. 

That s how 

they earned this. 

The glorious work of the 

northern freedom fighters. 

Must make you proud 

to serve the Starks. 

I don t serve the Starks. 

I serve Lady Catelyn. 

Tell yourself that tonight 

when they swing in your dreams. 

  What are you doing  

  Burying them. 

We shouldn t stay here. 

We should get back on the river. 

I think these women 

would understand if   

I don t care 

what you think. 

 i I didn t leave it here.  i  

Untie me now. 

 i I gave it to you to cut  i  

 i the rope  and now I don t  i  

 i have me dagger no more.  i  

So unless it got stuck in your ass 

on its way to your cunt  

it stands to reason 

that it s gone   whoa  

What s your business here  

Traveling a prisoner. 

You re a woman. 

A woman  

 i Well  fuck me   i  

If you ve quite 

finished up   

All right  

we ll be going. 

Whoa  whoa. 

Who do you fight for  

The Starks. 

What did he do  

Apparently eating is now a crime. 

Who knew  

No  stealing is a crime. 

But it s not a crime to starve. 

That s justice for you. 

   i Where are you taking him   i  

  To Riverrun. 

Why Riverrun  

Steal from the Tullys  

it s their dungeons you rot in. 

  Why not kill him  

  For stealing a pig  

I don t give the orders. 

He must be important 

to someone. 

Sending him with you  

How important could he be  

All right  

have it your way  

m lady. 

  Do I know you  

  Have you been to Ashemark  

   i No.  i  

  Then you don t know me. 

Do you ever go to the river 

market at Salt Rock  

  Is it near Ashemark  

   i No.  i  

I ve never been there. 

What do you think 

of these beauties  

I hope you gave them 

quick deaths. 

Two of them we did  yeah. 

Wait. 

I do know you. 

That s Jaime Lannister. 

I wish someone had told me. 

I wouldn t have had 

to steal that pig. 

If this is the Kingslayer  

I think I d know about it. 

How do you know what 

the Kingslayer looks like  

I was at Whispering Wood. 

I saw him. 

 i They dragged him out of the woods  i  

 i and threw him down before the King.  i  

He s not the Kingslayer. 

Sorry to disappoint you. 

If he was  I d only 

be traveling his head. 

I have a question 

for you both. 

And I want you to answer it 

at the same time. 

 i I count to three   i  

 i you both answer.  i  

What s his name  

One. 

 i Two. Three.  i  

Two quick deaths. 

Those were Stark men. 

I don t serve the Starks. 

I serve Lady Catelyn. 

I told her I d take you 

to King s Landing  

and that s what 

I m going to do. 

Stay. 

Walder Frey is a dangerous 

man to cross. 

I know that. 

And you mean 

to do it anyway  

I love her. 

I know that seems 

important to you. 

It is important to me. 

Your father didn t love 

me when we married. 

He hardly knew me 

or I him. 

Love didn t just 

happen to us. 

We built it slowly 

over the years  

stone by stone  

for you  for your 

brothers and sisters  

for all of us. 

It s not as exciting as 

secret passion in the woods  

but it is stronger. 

It lasts longer. 

And that is what 

would be in store for me 

with one of 

Walder Frey s daughters  

  what you and father had  

  Why not  

Because she s not beautiful  

Because she s not exotic 

and exciting  

Now you re arguing just to argue 

because you arranged it. 

And you agreed to it. 

You gave him your word. 

Treat your oaths recklessly and 

your people will do the same. 

If your father lived 

his life for one thing   

My father is dead. 

And the only parent 

I have left has no right 

to call anyone reckless. 

You said you saw 

my victory in the flames. 

 i I did.  i  

  I still see it. 

  The flames lied. 

And I m no better 

than a savage 

trusting in a Fire God. 

I fought for your God 

in Blackwater Bay. 

I led my men to the gates 

of the Seventh Hell 

as their brothers burned 

alive  and for what  

Attacked from behind by 

Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. 

If you see so much in your flames  

why didn t you warn me  

The Lord of Light 

only allows me glimpses. 

You claimed to speak 

for a God. 

Will you quit the war just 

because you ve lost a battle  

You talk about war 

as if you understand it. 

 i I ve been fighting  i  

 i far longer than you.  i  

Have you  

Show me how you fight. 

Show me. 

Where s your God now  

Will he save you  

Where is your God  

Inside you. 

I murdered my brother. 

We murdered him. 

Share the weight 

with me. 

He wasn t your brother. 

This war 

has just begun. 

It will last for years. 

Thousands will die 

at your command. 

You will betray 

the men serving you. 

You will betray 

your family. 

You will betray everything 

you once held dear. 

And it will all 

be worth it 

because you are 

the Son of Fire. 

You are the Warrior 

of Light. 

You will sweep aside 

this pretender and that one. 

You will be King. 

You promise 

these things  but... 

you don t know. 

None of us know. 

Let me show you. 

Look into the fire  

my King. 

Look. 

I see fire. 

Keep looking. 

Do you see  

Do you see  my King  

Yes. 

I will kill that man. 

I don t care how many arrows 

they feather me with  

how many spears 

they run through me  

I will kill that horn blowing 

cunt before I fall. 

They want you to know 

you re surrounded. 

I know I m surrounded. 

I know that because I stood 

on the battlements 

and saw I was surrounded. 

 i They don t want  i  

 i you to sleep.  i  

They want to sap 

your spirit before   

Thank you  wise bald man. 

Thank you for explaining 

siege tactics to me. 

No word from my father  

No. 

Send more ravens. 

You killed 

all the ravens. 

The first time 

I saw Winterfell... 

The first time 

I saw Winterfell  

it looked like something 

that had been here for 

thousands of years 

and would be here 

for thousands of years 

after I was dead. 

I saw it 

and I thought  

 of course Ned Stark 

crushed our rebellion 

and killed my brothers. 

We never stood a chance against 

a man who lives here.  

Lord Stark went out of his way 

to make it your home. 

Yes  my captors were 

so very kind to me. 

You love 

reminding me of that. 

Everyone in this 

frozen pile of shit 

has always loved 

reminding me of that. 

You know what it s like 

to be told how lucky you are 

to be someone s prisoner  

To be told how much 

you owe them  

And then to go back home 

to your real father... 

I will kill that man. 

I swear it to 

the Drowned God  

the Old Gods  

the New Gods  

to every fucking God 

in every fucking heaven  

I will kill that man. 

Theon  listen to me. 

I serve Winterfell. 

Now Winterfell is yours. 

I m bound by oath 

to serve you. 

And what s your counsel  

trusted friend  

Run. 

 Northmen wait 

outside the walls. 

You have  men. 

You can t win. 

Wait for nightfall 

and run. 

There s nowhere to run. 

I d never make it back 

to the Iron Islands. 

And even if I did  

even if by some miracle 

I slipped through the lines 

and made it home  

I d be a coward. 

The Greyjoy who ran. 

The shame of the family. 

Don t go home. 

 i Join the Night s Watch.  i  

Once a man 

has taken the Black... 

he s beyond reach 

of the law. 

All his past crimes 

are forgiven. 

I won t make it 

to the Wall. 

I won t make it  feet 

past the Winterfell gates. 

There are ways. 

Hidden passageways built 

so the Lords of Winterfell 

could escape. 

The road will be dangerous. 

But with a little luck... 

the Night s Watch is an ancient  

honorable order. 

You ll have 

opportunities there. 

The opportunity for Jon Snow 

to cut my throat in my sleep. 

The opportunity to make 

amends for what you ve done. 

I ve done a lot  

haven t I  

Things I never 

imagined myself doing. 

I ve known you many years  

Theon Greyjoy. 

You re not the man 

you re pretending to be. 

Not yet. 

You may be right. 

But I ve gone too far 

to pretend to be anything else. 

You hear that  

That s the mating call 

of the Northmen. 

They want to fuck us. 

Well  I haven t had 

a good fuck in weeks. 

I m ready for one. 

They say every Ironborn man is 

worth a dozen from the mainland. 

Aye  

  You think they re right  

  Aye. 

We die today  brothers. 

We die bleeding 

from  wounds 

with arrows in our necks 

and spears in our guts  

but our war cries will echo 

through eternity. 

They will sing about 

the battle of Winterfell 

until the Iron Islands have 

slipped beneath the waves. 

Every man  woman  and child 

will know who we were 

and how long we stood. 

Aggar and Gelmarr  

Wex and Urzen  

Stygg and Black Lorren   

Ironborn warriors 

will cry out our names 

as they leap onto the shores 

of Seagard and Faircastle. 

Aye  

  Mothers will name their sons for us. 

  Aye  

Girls will think of us 

with their lovers inside them. 

Aye  

And whoever kills 

that fucking horn blower 

will stand in bronze 

above the shores of Pyke  

Aye  

  What is dead may never die  

  What is dead may never die  

Ah  

Thought he d never shut up. 

It was a good speech. 

Didn t want to interrupt. 

What is this  

What are you doing  

Let s go home. 

 i Come on.  i  

 i Why should I believe you   i  

Why would I lie 

about it  

To create strife between 

my sister and me. 

Where before there was 

nothing but love. 

Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill 

you on your sister s orders. 

If it weren t for your 

Squire s bravery  

you d be a dead man. 

   i Pod.  i  

  Yes  My Lord  

Would it be 

excessive of me 

to ask you to save 

my life twice in a week  

No  My Lord. 

 i You re a good lad.  i  

Get Bronn  tell him I want 

four of his most loyal 

Gold Cloaks outside 

my door at all times. 

I m afraid your friend 

has been relieved 

of his command 

of the City Watch. 

The Gold Cloaks are now firmly 

in the hands of your father 

or your sister. 

It varies 

from cloak to cloak. 

  Then my hill tribesmen. 

  Have gone home. 

Your father paid them 

quite handsomely. 

I m afraid we won t 

be seeing each other 

for some time  My Lord. 

Don t want to swim too close 

to a drowning man  

And I thought 

we were friends. 

We are. 

Podrick  would you mind  

There are many who know 

that without you 

this city faced 

certain defeat. 

 i The King won t give  i  

 i you any honors   i  

 i the histories  i  

 i won t mention you   i  

but we will not forget. 

Come along now  Podrick. 

My love. 

It was good of you 

to come. 

Good of me  

Of course I come. 

  I want to see you. 

  Believe me  you don t. 

Have you looked  

I will be the first. 

Well  

You are a mess. 

I m a monster 

as well as a dwarf. 

You should charge 

me double. 

You think I m here 

for money  

That was the arrangement 

we made. 

I pay you 

and you lie to me. 

Aw  I m a poor 

little rich man 

and nobody loves me  

so I make jokes all the time 

and pay them to laugh. 

Fuck your money. 

Let s leave. 

  Leave  

  Leave King s Landing. 

They tried to kill you. 

They will try again. 

Going into wars  

fighting soldiers   

you re terrible at this. 

Let s take a boat to Pentos 

and never come back. 

You don t belong here. 

What would we do 

in Pentos  

Eat  drink  

fuck  live. 

I want to go with you. 

So do it. 

Your father  your sister  

all these bad people  

they can t stop you. 

Forget about them. 

Come with me. 

I can t. 

I do belong here. 

These bad people 

are what I m good at. 

Outtalking them  

outthinking them. 

It s what I am. 

And I like it. 

I like it more than 

anything I ve ever done. 

Are you going to leave  

You have a shit memory. 

I am yours 

and you are mine. 

In the sight 

of the Seven  

I hereby seal 

these two souls  

binding them as one 

for eternity. 

Look upon one another 

and say the words. 

Father  smith  

warrior  mother  

maiden  crone  

stranger... 

  I am hers and she is mine... 

  I am his and he is mine... 

from this day 

until the end of my days. 

Is this a riddle  

Khaleesi  

Khaleesi  

 i Khaleesi   i  

Are you trying to frighten me 

with magic tricks  

You want me  

Here I am. 

Are you afraid 

of a little girl  

 i How did he find us   i  

What are you doing here  

Waiting for you. 

How did you know 

we d come this way  

After all the things 

you have seen  

this is your question  

How did you 

kill those guards  

Was it hard  

No harder than taking a new name 

if you know the way. 

Show me how. I want 

to be able to do it  too. 

If you would learn  

you must come with me. 

Where  

Far and away across 

the Narrow Sea to Braavos. 

My dancing master 

was from Braavos. 

To be a dancing master 

is a special thing  

but to be a faceless man   

that is something 

else entirely. 

A girl has many names 

on her lips   

Joffrey  Cersei  

Tywin Lannister  

Ilyn Payne  the Hound. 

Names to offer up 

to the Red God. 

She could offer them all 

one by one. 

I want to. 

But I can t. 

I need to find 

my brother and mother. 

And my sister. 

I need to find 

her  too. 

Then we must part. 

A man has duties as well. 

Here. 

What is it  

A coin of great value. 

Could it buy a horse  

It is not meant 

for the buying of horses. 

Then what good is it  

If the day comes when 

you must find me again  

just give that coin 

to any man from Braavos 

and say these words to him  

 Valar Morghulis.  

Valar Morghulis. 

Please don t go  Jaqen. 

Jaqen is dead. 

Say it again. 

Valar Morghulis. 

Valar Morghulis. 

Good. 

Farewell  Arya Stark. 

Osha  what are you doing  

Tell us what medicine 

to get from your chambers. 

  We ll make you better. 

  I feel just fine. 

They burned it down. 

They burned everything. 

Not everything. 

Not you. 

But they may come back. 

You have to go. 

Put on your 

warmest clothes. 

Pack as much food as you 

can carry and go north. 

North s the wrong way. 

Their mother and brother 

are south. 

We don t know where. 

There are too many enemies 

in the South. 

Go to the Wall 

to Jon. 

 i He ll look after you and let your  i  

 i mother know you re safe.  i  

I don t want to leave you. 

No more than I want 

to leave you. 

I pulled you 

into the world. 

Both of you. 

I ve seen both your faces 

almost every day since. 

And for that  I consider 

myself very  very lucky. 

Go now with Hodor. 

 i Go on.  i  

I ll be right here. 

Hodor. 

Osha. 

You must protect them. 

You re the only one 

who can. 

You may have to protect 

them against your own kind. 

I ve got no great love 

for my own kind. 

I ll get you milk 

of the poppy. 

Tell me where to find it. 

I don t want 

milk of the poppy. 

Do it quickly. 

Until the sun 

rises in the west 

and sets in the east  

until the rivers run dry 

and the mountains blow 

in the wind like leaves. 

They miss their mother. 

They want to be with you. 

Do you want 

to be with them  

You will be. 

 i When your dragons  i  

 i were born   i  

our magic 

was born again. 

It is strongest 

in their presence. 

And they are strongest 

in yours. 

You will be with them  

through winter  summer  

and winter again. 

Across a thousand 

thousand seasons 

you will be with them. 

And we will be with you 

until time comes to an end. 

Welcome home  

Daenerys Stormborn. 

This is not my home. 

My home is across the sea 

where my people 

are waiting for me. 

They will be waiting 

a long time. 

Dracarys. 

We should be there 

by sundown. 

Won t be a fun 

night for you. 

Mance knows how 

to make crows sing. 

If you know what to say  

you might just make it 

through the night. 

Not talking s 

not the way to go. 

Careful with that. 

You might cut yourself. 

Never swung a sword 

before  have you  

You look like a baby 

with a rattle. 

 i Enough of that   i  

  Stop  

  Why  traitor  

So you can give Mance Rayder 

an invitation to Castle Black  

Let  em fight. 

That s it  

That s what you can do  

You little shit. 

Your traitor father 

teach you that  

Or was it your whore mother  

We are the Watchers 

on the Wall. 

You can tell Mance 

that s the man who killed 

Qhorin Halfhand. 

  Burn the body. 

 i   Aye.  i  

You don t want this one 

coming back for you. 

Come along  Jon Snow. 

Time to meet 

the King Beyond The Wall. 

What the    

 i Khaleesi  please.  i  

He said you d never 

leave Qarth alive. 

Come. 

Nothing. 

Thank you  

Xaro Xhoan Daxos. 

 i Thank you for teaching  i  

 i me this lesson.  i  

I am King of Qarth. 

I can help you now  

truly help you. 

We can take 

the Iron Throne. 

  I ll bring you   ships. 

  Please  Khaleesi  I beg you. 

All that you have dreamed 

is within your reach  

I beg you  please  

  Khaleesi. 

  Please  Please  

 i   Khaleesi   i  

It s all a lie. 

Looks real enough to me. 

Real enough 

to buy a ship  

Aye  a small ship. 

I thought we were coming 

north to fight wildlings. 

Is this goat  

It s moose. 

People shouldn t 

live anywhere 

you need to burn shit 

to keep warm. 

Well  you see a tree  

let me know. 

If you step back 

and think about it  

the thing about Gilly 

that s so interesting is   

  Just bloody kill me. 

  No  truly. 

The thing about her that 

I find so interesting is that 

after all that 

Craster s done to her  

she s still got hope that 

life might get better. 

The thing about Gilly 

that you find so interesting 

is that she said 

six words to you. 

And the thing about you 

that I find so interesting 

is absolutely nothing. 

It s Jon 

and the Halfhand. 

They re back. 

Two blasts is wildlings. 

You re not fighting them alone. 

Come on. 

Three blasts  

Run  

Wait  Wait for me

Game of Thrones   Season  Episode  

 The Sons of the Harpy  

 b  Resynced and translated by  

Enjoy    b  

Is that Estermont  

Tarth  Ser Jaime. 

The sapphire isle. 

Why are we on a merchant ship  

Why not a Lannister sails  

This ship sent to Old Town and 

we ll get off here not 

far from Sunspear. 

Row ourselves to the 

Dornish shores overnight. 

 Have you ever been in Dorne  

  No. 

  I Have 

The Dornish are crazy. 

All they want to do is fight and fuck  

  fuck and fight. 

  You should be happy to go back there. 

There s nothing like a good fight 

to get you in the mood for fucking. 

And there s nothing like 

a fuck mad Dornish girl 

to clear your head for the next fight. 

It s how the two work together. 

Now we re gonna be doing a 

lot of fighting I m sure. 

Well I am. 

But I don t imagine we ll get 

to stick around for the rest. 

Not after we ve kidnapped 

their princess. 

We re not kidnapping their princess  

We re rescuing my niece   

bringing her back to her family. 

Your niece  

I ve been doing this sort 

of thing a long time. 

I m good at it. 

  That s why you re here 

  I know. 

Why are you here  

Why not send  mercenaries  

...or an army  

Unlike most folks  

you ve actually got one. 

Because I do not 

want to start a war. 

That still doesn t explain 

what you re doing here. 

It has to be me. 

If I m putting something 

like this together. 

A one handed man 

who happens to be one of the most 

recognizable faces in Westeros 

  No... 

  It has to be me. 

You set your brother 

free  didn t you... 

I bet your sister didn t like that. 

Varys  set him free. 

Well... 

If you ever see that wee little fucker  

give him my regards. 

He murdered my father. 

If I ever see him  

I ll split him in two. 

And then I ll give him your regards. 

The Iron Bank has called in   

of the Crown debts. 

Given the expense of 

rebuilding the royal 

  roof... 

  How much can the Crown afford  

With Winter coming... 

half what they ask. 

...maybe less. 

You re Master of coin. 

How do we pay them  

Well  House Tyrell 

could front the money  

The Crown would pay 

us back in time 

or I ll have words 

with my daughter. 

You have already 

given us too much. 

No  we must arrange better 

terms with the Iron Bank. 

Absolutely. 

In person. 

Me  

We must send an envoy to the Iron 

Bank  someone with importance 

to show these bankers 

our respect. 

As the King s Master of Coin  I can 

thinik of no one more qualified. 

I would be honored  your Grace. 

The Kings expressed concern about his 

father in laws safety on this voyage. 

He s ordered Ser Meryn... 

to personally lead your escort. 

A member of the Kings Guard  

  Please  I... 

  Safe travels  Lord Tyrell. 

Of course  of course... 

I ll give your regards 

to the Titan of Braavos. 

The small council grows 

smaller and smaller 

Not small enough. 

May I offer you some 

wine  your holiness  

No. 

The old High Septon would ve 

asked for the vintage. 

I could say that our minds are 

the temples to the Seven... 

and should be kept clear. 

But  truth is... 

I don t like the taste. 

How may I server you  

All over Westeros  we hear 

of temples being burned... 

Silence Sister s raped... 

bodies of holy men 

piled in the streets. 

Wars teach people to 

obey the sword... 

not the Gods. 

Perhaps the gods need 

a sword of their own. 

In the days before the 

Targaryens  the faith militant 

dispensed the justices 

of the Seven. 

The faith militant was dissolved 

more than two centuries ago. 

If I explain the holy 

purpose to my son  the King 

I have no doubt he will sign a decree  

arming the believers you feel worthy. 

An army that defends the bodies 

and souls of the common people  

An army in service to 

the Gods themselves. 

and to you  of course... 

as the chosen representative 

of the Seven. 

An honor I never expected... 

or a deed ever wished for. 

And  why you were chosen. 

You and I know both 

how the world works. 

Too often  the wicked 

or the wealthiest 

are beyond the reach of justice. 

The King himself can t always 

punish those who deserve it most. 

All sinners are equal 

before the gods. 

What would you say if I told you of 

a great sinner in our very midst 

shielded by gold and privilege. 

May the Father judge in justice. 

Get up  

Help me     Help Me  

Get off me  

Shut up  

This is Lord Petyr 

Baylish s establishment. 

Cock Suck  

Boy Fucker  

You buggering filth  

There is a special place in the 

Seventh Hell for your kind. 

Please... 

Please  I ll pay  

I... I ll pay all of you  

Yes you will. 

Seize him. 

Get your hands off of me  

 Sir Loras of House Tyrell... 

you have broken the 

laws of Gods and men. 

Who do you think you are  

Justice. 

Why is my brother in a cell  

I... I don t know. 

I... I didn t do it. 

We both know who did. 

You told me she was 

returning to Casterly Rock. 

You say your mothers 

behind this  

She s jealous you re 

not hers anymore 

aresting my brother 

is her revenge. 

Aren t you and mother 

getting along  

Oh  my sweet... 

Sweet King. 

Do you have any affection 

for me at all  

Of course I do 

you re my Queen. 

I can t bear to think that my brother 

is locked in some grimy cell. 

I ll set him free for you. 

Do you promise  

I demand that Ser 

Loras be freed  now. 

Did I arrest him  

Well... no. 

But  y you armed the 

faith militant. 

You gave the High Sparrow an army  

I did. 

And your wife has every 

right to criticize. 

We can not allow fanatics to 

arrest the Queens brother 

no matter his perversions. 

Then... 

Can I tell Margaery you ll 

have Sir Loras released  

I told you  I m not holding Sir Loras. 

You re the King 

I m sure if you speak 

to the High Sparrow  

he ll release the poor boy. 

 I  Halt     I  

His Holiness is praying. 

He will not be disturbed. 

Give the order  and we ll 

clear out this rebel. . 

You mean... 

kill them  

Him  The Septon  

You ll be sending them to 

meet the Gods that they love. 

 I  Bastard    I  

 I  You are an abomination    I  

 I  You re born of sin    I  

 I  Filthy Bastard    I  

We ll find another way. 

 I  Abomination    I  

My Queen  

There was no way to free Ser 

Loras without violence. 

You re the King of the Andals. 

The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms  

the Protector of the Realm. 

And you let a band of fanatics 

imprison your brother by law. 

  I m going to speak with the High Sparrow. 

  Are you  When  

  I don t know... 

  You don t know  

He was praying... just now. 

I have to send word to Grandmother. 

Will come back later  

I need to be with my 

family  Your Grace. 

Of course... 

  You think highly of this boy  

   i  Good    i  

Lord Commander of 

the Night s Watch. 

It is a bastard by some tavern slut. 

Perhaps. 

But that wasn t Ned Starks way. 

I should ve given you a son. 

  Not your fault 

  Who s then  

I gave him nothing but weakness 

and deformity. 

Those scars mean nothing 

to the Lord of Light. 

My Lady. 

Her father s the 

Lords chosen King. 

And her father s blood 

runs through her veins. 

You march on Winterfell soon  

We must. 

To beat the Snow s. 

Once before  you put your faith 

in Ser Davos and left me behind. 

I hope you won t make 

that mistake again. 

I won t. 

I need you. 

You only need faith  My King. 

And you  my lady  

what do you need  

To serve my Lord. 

Lord Ashford 

Lady Caulfield 

Lord Smallwood 

  Never even heard of these people. 

  They haven t heard of you either. 

But we need men  and 

they have some. 

How many men does this  Lord 

Mason  have to send us  

More than Lord Webbly. 

  Not him. 

  I know.. 

I m sorry. 

But we need men  and supplies  and 

  Roose Bolton s the Warden of the North 

  He murdered my brother. 

We swore to be the 

watcher s on the wall. 

We can t watch the 

wall with fifty men  

and we can t get more men without 

help from the Warden of the North. 

Apologies my lady. 

Lord Commander. 

How can I help you  

Come with us when we ride South. 

None of us know the 

castle as well as you do. 

Its hidden tunnels... 

its weaknesses  its people. 

Winterfell was your home once  

don t you want to chase 

the rats out of it  

Castle Black is my home now. 

The Night s Watch take no part in 

the wars of the Seven Kingdom s. 

There s only one war. 

Life against death. 

Come... 

Let me show you what 

you re fighting for. 

You gonna show me some 

vision in the fire. 

Forgive me my lady... 

I don t trust in visions. 

No visions. 

No magic. 

Just life... 

Do you feel my heart beating  

This power in you... 

you resisted  and that s your mistake. 

Embrace it. 

The Lord of Light made 

us male and female. 

Two parts of a greater whole. 

You re not joining 

this power. 

The power to make life. 

Power to make light. 

And the power to cast shadows... 

I don t think Stannis  

would like that very much. 

Then we shouldn t tell. 

I can t. 

Why  

I swore a vow. 

I loved another... 

The Death don t need lovers  

only living. 

I know... 

but I still love her. 

You know nothing  Jon Snow. 

Are you lonely  

Just bored. 

My father used to tell me that boredom 

indicates a lack of inner resources. 

Were you bored a lot too  

I know Castle Black... 

  is no place for a child. But I... 

  I like it  

I thought I d be left at home. 

I know mother didn t want to bring me. 

Why d you say that  

She told me   I don t 

want to bring you.  

She shouldn t have said that. 

Are you ashamed of me  father  

When you were an infant... 

A Dornish trader 

landed on Dragonstone. 

His goods were junk  except for... 

one wooden doll. 

We even sowed a dress on it  

in the colors of our house. 

No doubt you ve heard of your birth. 

And assumed new father s 

were easy targets. 

I still remember how you smiled when 

I put that doll in your cradle  

and you pressed it to your cheek. 

By the time we burned the 

doll  it was too late. 

I was told you would die  

or worse... 

the grey scale would go slow. 

That you d grow just enough to know the 

world before taking it away from you. 

Everyone advised me to send 

you to the ruins of Valirya 

to live out your short 

life with the Stone Men  

before the sickness spread 

through the castle. 

I told them all to go to hell. 

I called in every maestro 

on this side of the world. 

Every Healer... 

every Apothecary. 

They stopped the disease 

and saved your life. 

Because you did not belong across the 

world with the bloody Stone Men. 

You are the Princess Shireen 

of House Baratheon. 

And you are my daughter. 

I thought I might find you here. 

Your Aunt Lyanna... 

Father never talked about her. 

Sometimes  I d find him down 

here lighting the candles. 

They say she was beautiful. 

I saw her once. 

I was a boy  living with 

your mother s family. 

Lord Whent of the Great 

Tourney at Arrenhal. 

Everyone was there... 

the Mad King  

your father  

Robert Baratheon  

and Lyanna. 

She was already 

promised to Robert. 

You can imagine what it was like 

for me  a boy from nowhere... 

nothing to his name... 

watching these legendary men 

tilting of the lists. 

The last two rider s were... 

Barristan Selmy and Rheagar Targaryen. 

When Rheagar won  everyone 

cheered for their Prince. 

I remember I was laughing when he took off 

his helmet and they saw that silver hair. 

How handsome he was. 

Until he rode right past his wife  

Elia Martell  

and all the smiles died. 

Never seen so many 

people so quiet. 

He rode past his wife 

and he laid a crown with 

winter roses in Lyanna s lap. 

Blue was frost. 

How many tens of thousands had to die 

because Rheagar chose your aunt  

Yes... he chose them  

and then kidnapped 

her  and raped her. 

Come 

Let s speak somewhere 

the dead can t hear us. 

Dressed for riding... 

I am. 

Where are you going  

King s Landing. 

King s Landing  

Cersei sent for me. 

We mustn t let her 

sniff out any trouble. 

You can t leave me here  

You know how hard it is to get with 

people you despise  believe me. 

But it won t be for long. 

How do you know  

Stannis Baratheon garrisons 

the Castle Black. 

He ll march South to King s Landing 

before the Winter snow block his way. 

But first  

he has to take Winterfell. 

You don t konw that. 

I do. 

Once he liberates these 

lands from the Bolton s  

he ll rally your fathers 

bannermen to his cause 

with the North behind them. 

Stannis can finally 

take the Iron Throne. 

You think he ll 

defeat the Bolton s  

He has a larger army  

and the finest military 

commander in Westeros. 

A betting man  would put 

his money on Stannis. 

As it happens  I 

am a betting man. 

And if you re right  

Stannis takes Winterfell  

he rescues you from the most 

despised family in the North. 

Grateful for your late father s 

courageous support of his claim... 

he names you...  

Wardeness of the North. 

But I... 

I wouldn t... 

Wardeness of the North  

You are the last surviving Stark. 

He needs you. 

And what if you re wrong  

What if Stannis never attacked Winterfell 

or he does  and the 

Bolton s defeat him  

Then you will take this Bolton boy  

Ramses  and make him yours. 

  I don t know how to do that. 

  Of course you do. 

He s already fallen for you. 

His father frightens me. 

And he should... 

he s a dangerous man. 

But even the most dangerous 

men  can be outmaneuvered. 

And you ve learned to 

manouver from the very best. 

I ll return before too long. 

You be strong  without me. 

The North will be yours. 

Do you believe me  

I expect I ll be a married 

woman by the time you return. 

Breakfast  

That would ve been 

a shit way to die. 

As far as I ve seen  they re 

all shit ways to die. 

 I  Aye.  I  

But your lot have to give 

the singers a good ending. 

I don t care what s sung 

about me when I m dead. 

No  

Two knights  off to 

rescue a princess... 

  sounds like a good song to me. 

  Sounds like all the rest. 

What about you  

What shit way would you choose  

In my own Keep  

drinking my own wine. 

Watching my son s 

grovel for a fortune. 

How disappointing... 

I thought you d have something 

more exciting planned. 

I ve had an exciting life... 

I want my death to be boring. 

And how do you want to go  

In the arms of the woman I love. 

She want the same thing  

Let s go. 

The captain of that ship... 

  what was he  Braavosi  

  Pentosi . 

  and he s headed to Old Town  

  As I said... 

Why  

What s to stop him from 

ducking down the coast... 

I tell the locals that Jaime 

Lannister s in Dorne  

A bag of gold. 

I m not sure you understand how much people 

hate your family in this part of the world. 

It was a heavy bag. 

And I bet he swore all 

kinds of oaths to get it. 

But you won t be around if he breaks it. 

  How many do you count  

  Four. 

And how many do you think you can take  

One... if he s slow. 

Fucked in the ass. 

Morning lads  

Glad we found you. 

Who are you  

Cooper. 

And this is Darnell. 

  You re from King s Landing  

  Accent gave me away. 

Flea Bottom. 

Whelped and whipped. 

Why are you here  

Our ship capsized in the night. 

We managed to swim ashore. 

It s a near thing  really... 

Thought the sharks would get us. 

There are no sharks in Dorne. 

I could ve sworn those 

were shark fins. 

Dolphin s  maybe. 

Throw your sword in the sand  

Boys  there s no need for this. 

Just point us in the right direction  

and we ll find our way home. 

Swords in the sand  now  

That one should be slow enough. 

Nice move. 

...Luck  

You had a wonderful teacher. 

I always wanted a 

Dornish stallion. 

Beasts can run a day and 

night without tiring. 

We ll ride to the Water Garden s 

with a nice breeze in our face. 

But first  we need to 

bury these bodies. 

Birds have to eat too. 

Corpses raise questions  questions raise armies. 

We re not here to start a war. 

Do you know how long it will 

take us to dig all those hole s  

I can t dig very well with one hand. 

Not at all  really. 

Momma. 

  Nym... Obara 

  Will it be war  

Prince Doran will weep for 

your father  but nothing else. 

We must avenge Oberyn ourselves. 

Without Doran  we have no army to 

march against the Lannister s. 

We don t need an 

army to start a war. 

Queen Cersei loves her children... 

  ...and we have one of them. 

  We may have a problem. 

A ship s captain  who found 

me at Planky Town  claiming 

he had information to sell. 

He told me he smuggled Jaime 

Lannister into Dorne. 

He s come for Myrcella. 

If he gets to her before we do  we 

lose our only chance for revenge. 

You must choose... 

Doran s way and peace  

or my way... 

and war. 

I m with you. Always. 

Nym  

Obara  

When I was a child  Oberyn 

came to take me to court. 

I d never seen this man  and yet 

he called himself my father. 

My mother wept  said 

I was too young  

and a girl. 

Oberyn tossed his spear 

at my feet and said 

 Girl or boy  we 

fight our battles. 

But the God s let us 

choose our weapons.  

My father pointed to the spear  

then to my mother s tears. 

I made my choice long ago. 

Thank you. 

Who are you  

Your capture. 

Do you have wine  

No. 

I can t sleep without wine. 

Then stay awake. 

You re going the wrong way. 

My sister s in Westeros. 

Westeros... is West  

We re heading East... 

I m not taking you 

to your sister. 

You said you were 

taking me to the Queen. 

I am. 

Queen Daenerys Targaryen. 

She s the Queen I serve. 

What a waste of a 

good kidnapping. 

So happens I was 

heading there myself  

What business would you 

have with the Queen  

Gold and glory  

Oh  and hate. 

If you ve ever met my 

sister  you d understand. 

So... 

now that it s clear 

we re on the same side. 

A high born knight from 

the North of Westeros  

down on his luck in Essos. 

Dragon epaulettes  

Bear sigil breast fit. 

You re Jorah Mormont. 

I have to ask... 

how  exactly  were you 

serving your Queen 

in a whore house  

half a world away  

Is it possible  that 

you were running  

Why would you be running  

And why would she 

have sent you away  

Oh  wait  

You were spying on 

her  weren t you  

It s all coming back to me  

I was drunk through most of the small 

council meetings  but it s all coming back 

You passed notes to 

Varys  little birds. 

She found out  didn t she  

Found out  and exiled you. 

And now you hope to win 

back her favor with a gift. 

A risky scheme... 

one might even say  desperate. 

Do you think Daenerys would 

execute me  and pardon you  

I d say the reverse 

is just as likely. 

Everyone looks happy 

enough from up here. 

What  

I was thinking of all the 

times your brother made me 

go with him down from the Red Keep  

into the streets of King s Landing. 

  Why  

  He liked to walk among the people  

he liked to sing to them. 

  He sang to them  

  Yes.  laughs  

Rhaegar would take a 

spot on the hook 

or ithe street of seeds... 

and then he d sang. 

Just like all the 

other minstrels. 

  And what did you do  

  I made sure no one killed him. 

And... I collected the money. 

Well... he liked to see 

how much he could make. 

  He was good  

  He was very good. 

Viserys never told you  

He told me Rhaegar was 

good at killing people. 

Rhaegar never liked killing... 

he loved to sing. 

And what did you 

do with the money  

Well  one time  we gave it to the 

next minstrel down the street. 

One time  he gave it to an 

orphanage in Flea Bottom. 

One time... 

he got horribly drunk. 

Your Grace. 

Hizdahr is here  waiting 

in the audience chamber. 

How many others are there  

Fifty... a hundred. 

Will you be joining 

us  Ser Barristan  

I... think I can protect 

you from Hizdhar Zo Loraq. 

I think I can protect me 

from Hizdhar Zo Loraq. 

Go  Ser Barristan. 

Sing a song for me. 

Your Grace. 

 I  All men must die.   I  

  But not all can die in glory. 

  Glory  

Why else do men fight  

Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow 

Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms  

So their names would live on. 

Those who find victory in the fighting 

pits  will never become kings... 

but their names will live on. 

It s the best chance 

they ll ever have. 

Is that what you used to tell men 

before you set them to 

butchering each other for sport  

His Grace  today is the traditional 

start of the fighting season. 

I do not recognize this tradition. 

Traditions  are the only thing 

that will hold this city... 

your city  together. 

Without them  former slaves and former 

masters have nothing in common. 

Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. 

I can t promise this is the 

answer to all our problems... 

...but it s a start. 

 i My son.  i  

My firstborn son. 

My child king  hush. 

Listen to the gods  for you they sing. 

Fight no more  sweet child. 

Your wars are won. 

The wolves are buried 

and the false stag done. 

Shut your blue eyes  my love. 

Let the crown fall. 

The Father above 

beckons you to his hall. 

In Seventh Heaven 

I ll see you once more. 

But now I seek vengeance 

on Sansa the whore 

and my brother the Imp 

who killed his own king. 

Born amongst lions  our curse from within. 

I will slay him  I swear. 

With noose or with knife  

though it take me a fortnight  

a moon or my life. 

 i What is that I hear and smell   i  

 i Someone I ll soon send to hell.  i  

 i It s time to see if truth they told  i  

 i who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.  i  

 i Get the wig   i  

 i You beast  you beast. 

You killed my wife.  i  

 i And now you ve 

taken your father s life.  i  

 i No worse child ever stained this land.  i  

 i I curse the day I named you.  i  

 i My greatest crime   i  

You re good at that. 

Where did you learn  

I m a jealous woman. 

I ve always liked bad men 

and they ve always liked me. 

They d come home 

wherever home was that night 

stinking of some whore s perfume. 

So we d fight and I d put a 

hole in them. And then I d feel terrible  

so I d patch them up. 

I got good at patching them up. 

And good at putting holes in them. 

And that. 

What happened to the actress  

The one who wanted you dead. 

Bianca. 

She ll have a hard time finding work 

as an actress after what I did to her face. 

Mmm. 

I never did learn to cook. 

But eat. Eat. You need it. 

The company is moving on to Pentos soon. 

You should come with us. 

  I can t. 

  Why not  

Got a feeling you d be 

good at this sort of work. 

And besides  

we need a new actress. 

I don t think I could 

remember all of the lines. 

Come with us. 

What s left for you here  

You wouldn t be safe. 

Not while she s looking for me. 

Who  

She doesn t have a name. 

Where will you go  

Essos is east and Westeros is west. 

But what s west of Westeros  

I don t know. 

Nobody does. 

  That s where all the maps stop. 

  The edge of the world  maybe. 

I d like to see that. 

  What s that  

  Milk of the poppy. 

I don t want any. 

Sleep is the only way you ll heal. 

Trust me  

if my soup didn t 

kill you  nothing will. 

Thing about Gatins  right  

is he used to be pretty. 

I was a famous kisser. 

You lads know how to kiss proper  

  Course we do. 

  This is for masters  this technique. 

  You re not ready. 

  I m ready. 

He says he s ready. 

All right. 

Now  pay attention. 

You put your left hand 

on the back of the lady s head. 

Your right hand holds the 

small of the lady s back like so. 

Very romantic. 

Take your middle finger  yeah  

and you jam it right up her bunghole. 

So fucking close  

Ah  it smells like pussy to me. 

Look at him. 

You get hard  boy  

Fuck you  

Disgusting old twats. 

Got off on that  

did you  you old fuck  

Where s the other one  

  The one with the yellow cloak. 

  Fuck you  

Those are your last words  fuck you  

Come on  you can do better. 

Cunt  

You re shit at dying  you know that  

  I d call that a successful gambit. 

  Would you  

Look around. 

The city has come back to life. 

  You made a pact with fanatics. 

  I did and it worked. 

If you shaved your beard with 

a straight razor  you d say the razor worked. 

That doesn t mean it 

won t cut your throat. 

Spoken like a man who 

has never had to shave. 

I m going to miss you. 

I know. 

I hope you re right about 

this expedition of yours. 

If I don t return  

you ll know I was wrong. 

We need friends in Westeros. 

And we need ships. 

Most of all  we need our queen. 

She ll come back. 

She has to. 

My heart s been broken 

too many times already. 

I ll walk the rest of the way myself. 

I can t go off on a secret mission in the 

company of the most famous dwarf in the city. 

Varys. 

The most famous dwarf in the world. 

Your Grace  several 

members of the Faith Militant 

have been permitted 

entry to the Red Keep. 

Have been permitted  

That s rather a 

tortured way of putting it. 

They demand to see you  Your Grace. 

Who permitted them inside the Red Keep  

The king is aware of their presence  

He is  Your Grace. 

He s currently in his chambers at prayer. 

Your Grace  His Holiness the High Septon 

wishes to speak with you 

at the Great Sept of Baelor. 

His Holiness the High Septon is 

welcome to see me here in the Red Keep. 

Your Grace  

  this is not a request. 

  It is a request  Cousin Lancel. 

You are asking me for something  

I m refusing. 

The High Septon commands you. 

Are you sure you 

want to refuse him  

He promised me I could 

stay in the Red Keep 

  until my trial. 

  He made no such promises. 

  If you refuse to come of 

your own free will...   Get out. 

Move aside  ser. 

Order your man to step 

aside or there will be violence. 

I choose violence. 

Please tell His High Holiness 

he s always welcome to visit. 

Looks like a siege  my lady. 

You have a keen military mind  Pod. 

My lady. 

My lady  

Who goes there   

State your business  

My name is Brienne of Tarth. 

Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister 

I ve come to speak with him. 

Tell him I have his sword. 

Getting a bit old to be a squire  aren t we  

Podrick fucking Payne. 

  I thought you d be dead by now. 

  Not yet. 

  Are they in there  

  Uh huh. 

You think they re fucking  

What  

No. 

Why not  

I d fuck her. 

  You d fuck her  wouldn t you  

  I m her squire.   Oh. 

Well  he d fuck her  that s for sure. 

And she d fuck him  don t you think  

The way she looks at him. 

The way all women look 

at him is frankly irritating. 

I preferred working with the 

little brother on that account. 

Come on  you re the 

one with the magic cock. 

You must have 

shown it to her by now. 

She s training me to fight. 

Is she  Oh. 

An hour in the morning  

an hour at night. 

Every day. 

Then how come an old cunt like me 

can still sneak up and murder you  

  Well  that s a different sort of fighting. 

  Now  that s the truth  isn t it  

You want to learn 

that sort of fighting  

All right. 

All right  let s 

start with your footwork. 

Show me your stance. 

Now listen to me  Pod. 

See how your feet 

are about a yard apart  

Lesson number one  

assume everyone wants to hit you. 

 Cause they do  Pod. 

Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. 

Do it again. 

Come on  don t sulk. 

 i I never thought you d find her.  i  

 i I just assumed Sansa was dead.  i  

Why would you assume that  

In my experience  

girls like her don t live very long. 

I don t think you 

know many girls like her. 

Well  I m proud of you. 

I am. You fulfilled your oath 

to Catelyn Stark against all odds. 

Of course  my sister wants Sansa dead. 

The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey s 

murder  so there is that complication. 

What the hell are you doing here  

I ve come for the Blackfish. 

You re welcome to have him. 

Lady Sansa desires to take her 

ancestral seat back from the Boltons 

and assume her rightful 

position as Lady of Winterfell. 

With what army does 

she plan on taking Winterfell  

  The Tully army. 

  They re a bit occupied at the moment. 

I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun 

currently defended by the Tully rebels  

so you can see the conundrum. 

The Tullys are rebels because 

they re fighting for their home  

Riverrun was granted 

to the Freys by royal decree. 

As a reward for betraying Robb 

Stark and slaughtering his family. 

Exactly. 

We shouldn t argue about politics. 

You re a knight  Ser Jaime. 

I know there is honor in you. 

  I ve seen it myself. 

  I m a Lannister. 

Don t ask me to betray my own house. 

I do no such thing. 

Take Riverrun without bloodshed. 

Ride south again with your 

mission complete and your army intact. 

What do you propose  

Allow me to enter Riverrun 

under a flag of truce. 

Let me try to persuade the 

Blackfish to give up the castle. 

Why would he abandon 

his ancestral home  

Because you ll allow him to 

lead the Tully forces safely north. 

Have you ever met the Blackfish  

  No.   He s even 

more stubborn than you are. 

All right. Try to talk 

some sense into the old goat. 

He won t listen  

but his men might. 

Not everybody wants to 

die for someone else s home. 

I need your word. 

If I persuade him to abandon the castle  

you ll grant a safe passage north. 

You have my word. 

You have until nightfall. 

You gave it to me for a purpose. 

I ve achieved that purpose. 

It s yours. 

It will always be yours. 

One last thing  Ser Jaime. 

Yes  Lady Brienne  

Should I fail to persuade 

the Blackfish to surrender 

and if you attack the castle  

honor compels me 

to fight for Sansa s kin. 

Of course it does. 

To fight you. 

Let s hope it doesn t come to that. 

 i I ve said no three times already.  i  

I have a signed letter 

from your niece Sansa Stark. 

I haven t seen her 

since she was a child. 

I don t know her signature. 

I don t know you. 

And I will not surrender. 

Double the guards tonight. 

The Kingslayer wants to try us. 

I can feel it. 

  As I have said  my name is... 

  Yes  Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. 

  Good man. 

  He always spoke highly of you. 

And if he were here now  

I d tell him the same I m telling you. 

If you think I m 

abandoning my family s seat 

on the Kingslayer s word 

of honor  you re a bloody fool. 

Riverrun cannot stand 

against the Lannisters and the Freys. 

We can stand longer than your 

one handed friend thinks we can. 

He s not my friend. 

No  

Who gave you permission to cross 

the siege line and enter the castle  

Who gave you that sword 

with the gold lion on the pommel  

Ser Jaime kept his word 

to your niece Catelyn Stark. 

He sent me to find Sansa  

to help her as Catelyn wanted. 

He gave me this sword to protect her. 

That is what I have done and 

I will continue to do until the day I die. 

She s exactly like her mother. 

I don t have enough men 

to help her take Winterfell. 

You have more than she does. 

She wants her home back. 

I understand that. 

But this is my home. 

And if Jaime Lannister wants it  

he can bloody well take it 

the way everyone else does. 

Find the maester. 

We need to get a raven north to Sansa. 

What should I write  

Tell her I failed. 

There s to be a royal announcement  

There is. 

Why wasn t I informed  

There is to be a royal announcement 

in the throne room 

at this very moment. 

Where are you going  

To stand by my son. 

Your place is in the gallery 

with the other ladies of the court. 

Your Grace... 

Lords and ladies  

the Faith and the Crown 

are the two pillars 

that hold up this world. 

One collapses  

so does the other. 

The Father judges us all. 

If you break his laws... 

you will be punished. 

After conferring with His 

Holiness the High Septon  

we have determined that Loras Tyrell 

and Cersei Lannister s trial 

will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor 

on the first day of the Festival of the Mother. 

Furthermore  after much 

prayer and reflection  

the Crown has decided 

that from this day forward  

trial by combat will be forbidden 

throughout the Seven Kingdoms. 

The tradition is a brutish one  

a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in 

order to avoid true judgment from the gods. 

Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell 

will stand trial before seven septons 

as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. 

Seven blessings to all. 

 i Seven blessings.  i  

Your Grace... 

that old rumor you told me about. 

My little birds investigated. 

And  

Was it just a rumor or something more  

More. 

Much more. 

You seem happy. 

I am happy. 

You should both be happy as well. 

Not so long ago  this city 

was ready to devour itself. 

  Now it s like a man reborn. 

  I will be happy when our queen returns. 

Why don t you drink  

Why don t either of you ever drink  

Unsullied never drink. 

  Why not  

  Rules. 

And who made these rules  

Your former masters  

Those miserable old shits 

didn t want you to be human. 

Have a drink with me. 

And you  

What s your excuse  

I have tried wine before. 

It made me feel funny. 

That s how you know it s working. 

Here s to our queen. 

Anyone not drinking is 

disrespecting our queen. 

To Daenerys Stormborn  

Mother of Dragons  Breaker of Chains  

long may she reign. 

  Long may she reign. 

  Long may she reign. 

  Do you like it  

  Tastes like it has turned. 

Yes  yes. Fermentation. 

One day  

after our queen has 

taken the Seven Kingdoms... 

I d like to have my own vineyard. 

Make my own wine. 

The Imp s Delight. 

Only my close friends could drink it. 

Tell me a joke  Missandei of Naath. 

I do not know any jokes. 

Grey Worm  

Right. 

Three lords walk into a tavern... 

a Stark  a Martell  and a Lannister. 

They order ale  but when 

the barkeep brings them over  

each of them finds a fly in his cup. 

The Lannister  outraged  

shoves the cup aside and demands another. 

The Martell plucks the fly 

out and swallows it whole. 

The Stark reaches into his cup  

pulls out the fly and shouts  

 Spit it out  you wee shit. Spit it out.  

It s funnier in Westeros. 

The Starks and the Lannisters  

I thought these were enemies. 

Yes. 

A joke is like a story  Torgo Nudho. 

  Not a true story  necessarily. 

  A story that s supposed to make you laugh... 

ideally. Not at the moment  perhaps. 

Missandei  do you like the wine  

I do. 

Tell a joke. 

Two translators are on a sinking ship. 

The first says  

 Do you know how to swim   

The second says   No  but I 

can shout for help in  languages.  

Ah  

That is the worst joke I ever heard. 

You don t even know what a joke is. 

I am soldier all my life. 

You think I never hear joke  

You lied to us. 

I make joke. 

More jokes. 

I once walked into a brothel 

with a honeycomb and a jackass. 

The madam says... 

The Masters have 

come for their property. 

Lord Edmure. 

I apologize for the 

way the Freys treated you. 

A man of your birth deserves better. 

You have my word you ll be 

properly fed and clothed from now on. 

I have your word  

Oh  good. 

Good  that s... 

that s a fine thing. 

My uncle will never 

surrender the castle  ser. 

  Whatever game you re playing. 

  The Blackfish is an old man. 

A good death is all he can hope for. 

But you  you have a child now  I ve heard. 

A son you sired on your 

wedding night. You re a potent man. 

A son I ve never met 

born of a wife that I haven t 

seen since our first night together. 

You should be with them both. 

I can arrange that  you realize  

Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. 

A tutor for your boy  

knights to train him to fight and to ride. 

And when he comes of age  

  he ll have a keep of his own. 

  Do you imagine yourself a decent person  

Is that it  

After you ve massacred my family. 

Kept me in a cell for years. 

Stolen our lands. 

I ll remind you that 

our houses are at war. 

I m sorry if this conflict 

has inconvenienced you  

but rebelling against the 

Crown does have consequences. 

Says the man who shoved 

his sword through his king s back. 

Did I give you the impression 

that this was a negotiation  It s not. 

You understand. 

On some level you understand 

  that you re an evil man. 

  I ll leave the judgments to the gods. 

Well  that is convenient for you. 

You re a fine looking fellow  aren t you  

Your square jaw  

your golden armor. 

Tell me  

I want to know. I truly do. 

How do you live with yourself  

All of us have to believe 

that we re decent  don t we  

You have to sleep at night. 

How do you tell yourself 

that you re decent 

after everything that you ve done  

I was your sister s prisoner once. 

She hit me on the head with 

a rock if I remember correctly. 

Yeah. 

  She should have killed you. 

  Perhaps  but she didn t. 

Catelyn Stark hated 

me just like you hate me. 

But I didn t hate her. 

I admired her. 

Far more than her husband or her son. 

Do you think I care whom 

you admire and whom you don t  

No  I don t  but I m telling you anyway because 

you re my prisoner. You don t have a choice. 

The love she had for her children  

I was a little awed by it. 

Reminded me of my sister. 

Oh  I see. 

  You re a madman. 

  I m not here to trade insults. 

  Your sister was a strong... 

  Don t talk about Cat  

I ll talk about whomever I want. 

She loved her children. 

I suppose all mothers do  

but Catelyn and Cersei  

there s a fierceness you don t often see. 

They d do anything 

to protect their babies. 

Start a war. 

Burn cities to ash. 

Free their worst enemies. 

The things we do for love. 

You didn t come here 

to talk about our sisters. 

That s exactly why I came here. 

I love Cersei. 

You can laugh at that if you want. 

You can sneer. Doesn t matter. 

She needs me. 

And to get back to her  

I have to take Riverrun. 

I ll send for your baby boy. 

And I ll launch him into 

Riverrun with a catapult. 

Because you don t 

matter to me  Lord Edmure. 

Your son doesn t matter to me. 

The people in the castle 

don t matter to me. 

Only Cersei. 

And if I have to slaughter every Tully 

who ever lived to get back to her  

that s what I ll do. 

 i Who goes there   i  

Edmure Tully  

son of Hoster Tully 

and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. 

I demand entry. 

Don t let him in. 

He s the Lord of Riverrun. 

I have to obey his commands. 

He s been their captive ever since 

they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. 

Why do you think the people who 

murdered his king at the Red Wedding 

would decide to let him come home  

Because it s a trap  you idiot. 

  Don t let him in. 

  He s my lord  my lord. 

I ve sworn to serve the Lord of 

Riverrun and obey his commands. 

You re not obeying 

Edmure s commands. 

You re obeying the 

fucking Kingslayer s commands. 

 i I demand entry.  i  

  My lord has given an order. 

  With a knife to his throat. 

That is not a valid order. 

Lower the drawbridge and 

open the gate for Lord Ed... 

Aye  ser. 

I ll have your head 

before I surrender Riverrun. 

You are not lord of this castle  my lord. 

  Lower the drawbridge. 

  Aye  ser  

 i If you re wrong   i  

we ve just surrendered 

our most valuable prisoner. 

Welcome home  my lord. 

Command all the forces within 

the castle to lay down their arms. 

Open the gates. 

  My lord... 

  Your lord has given a command. 

 i Infantry  advance   i  

Find the Blackfish. 

Put him in irons and 

hand him over to the Freys. 

Find him. 

Go on. 

  Come with us. 

  I ve run before from the Red Wedding. 

I m not running again. 

This is my family home. 

Your family is in the North. 

Come with us. 

Don t die for pride when 

you can fight for your blood. 

You ll serve Sansa far 

better than I ever could. 

 i All the way down   i  

 i   Check that out  

  Go on  now.  i  

I haven t had a proper 

sword fight in years. 

I expect I ll make 

a damn fool of myself. 

We found the Blackfish  my lord. 

Good. 

Bring him to me. 

He died fighting  my lord. 

  I was wrong. I admit it. 

  That changes nothing. 

The Unsullied could mount 

a defense off the beachhead. 

  If the slavers  forces...   No more 

talking from you. Your talking gave us this. 

And I have acknowledged that. 

I m trying... 

You re trying to tell me what the army should 

do. You do not know what the army should do. 

All right  what should the army do  

We ll not go to the beach. 

If we go to the beach  the 

Masters will take the pyramid. 

The pyramid is the only place 

in the city we can defend. We stay here. 

  And then  

  We wait for them to come to us. 

Then we fight them. 

Clegane. 

What the fuck you doing here  

Chasing them. 

  You  

  Hanging them. 

  Any particular reason  

  They re our men. Or they were. 

They attacked a nearby 

sept and murdered the villagers. 

  Why do you want them  

  Same reason. 

I was helping build it. 

They killed a friend of mine. 

You ve got friends  

Not anymore. 

They re mine. 

It s the Brotherhood s good name 

they ve dragged through the dirt. 

Fuck your name. They re mine. 

I killed you once before  Dondarrion. 

Happy to do it again. 

Drop that arrow  you bloody girl. 

Tougher girls than 

you have tried to kill me. 

You can have one of them. 

Two. 

No  no  no. 

We re not butchers. 

  We hang them. 

  Hanging  

All over in an instant. 

Where s the punishment in that  

  They die. 

  We all bloody die. 

Except this one here. 

I ll only gut one of them. 

No. 

I ll chop off one hand. 

We gave you two of the three 

out of respect for your loss. 

That s generous. 

Bunch of nancies. 

There was a time I would have killed 

all seven of you just to gut these three. 

You re getting old  Clegane. 

He s not. 

Please don t. 

I ll give you anything. 

Got anything to eat  

Enjoying yourself  

I prefer chicken. 

You ought to join us. 

We could use you. 

I tried joining. 

  Didn t work out for me. 

  Clegane we re here for a reason. 

The Lord of Light is keeping 

Beric alive for a reason. 

He gave a failed  drunk priest 

the power to bring him back for a reason. 

We are part of something 

larger than ourselves. 

Lots of horrible shit in this world gets 

done for something larger than ourselves. 

Cold winds are rising in the North. 

And you re going to go stop them  

We need good men to help us. 

Last time you saw me  

you wanted to execute me. 

 i True enough.  i  

But the Lord of Light gave 

you the power to defeat me. 

Why  

I beat you because 

I m better than you  Beric. 

I was better than you before you 

started yammering on about the Lord 

and I m better than you now. 

Aye  you re probably right. 

You re a fighter. 

You were born a fighter. 

You walked away from the fight. 

How did that go  

Good and bad  young and old  

the things we re fighting 

will destroy them all alike. 

You can still help a lot more 

than you ve harmed  Clegane. 

It s not too late for you. 

Lady Crane  

 i Lady Crane   i  

If you d have done your job  

she would have died painlessly. 

Instead... 

The Many Faced God 

was promised a name. 

He must always receive what is his. 

You can t change that. 

I can t change that. 

No one can. 

And now he s been 

promised another name. 

Hey  

Get out  

Yah  

Hey  

Yah  

Ah  

 i My basket   i  

It will all be over soon. 

On your knees or on your feet  

Haven t we been through this already  

That won t help you. 

You told her to kill me. 

Yes. 

But here you are. 

And there she is. 

Finally a girl is no one. 

A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell 

and I m going home. 

That s it. Get it right to the top. 

Steady. Steady. 

Up she goes. 

Hey  come on. Put your 

back into it  huh  

Here you are  son. 

  Oh  gentlemen  please. 

  To my right. 

And you lot  come on. 

Come on  get it moving. 

Come on  come on. 

In all my days I ve never seen 

a man swing an ax like that. 

How many men did it 

take to cut you down  

Just one. 

He must have been some kind of monster. 

He was a woman. 

I think some of the men 

are a bit afraid of you. 

I m used to it. 

When I found you  I thought 

you d been dead for days. 

The way you were stinking already 

and you had bugs all over you 

and bone was coming through right there. 

I was gonna give you a proper 

burial and then you coughed. 

Oh  nearly shit myself. 

I reckoned you were gonna die 

by the time I loaded you on 

the wagon  but you didn t. 

Now  I reckoned you d die a dozen 

more times over the next few days  

but you didn t. What kept you going  

Hate. 

No  there s a reason you re still here. 

Aye  there s a reason. I m a big 

fucker and I m tough to kill. 

No  a reason. 

Gods aren t done with you yet. 

I ve heard that before. 

Man was talking about a 

different god  though. 

Well  maybe he was right. 

I don t know much about the gods. 

You re in the wrong line of work. 

Oh  there s plenty of 

pious sons of bitches 

who think they know the 

word of god or gods. 

I don t. I don t even 

know their real names. 

Maybe it is the Seven. Or 

maybe it s the old gods. 

Or maybe it s the Lord of Light. 

Or maybe they re all the 

same fucking thing. 

I don t know. 

What matters  I believe  

is that there s something 

greater than us. 

And whatever it is  it s got 

plans for Sandor Clegane. 

You didn t know me back in my time. 

You don t know the things I ve done. 

I ve heard stories. 

If the gods are real... 

why haven t they punished me  

They have. 

Your Grace. 

What are we reading today  

The Book of the Mother  Your Holiness. 

Chapter three  verse . 

Ah   As water rounds the 

stones  smoothing...  

 Smoothing what was jagged  

so does a woman s love 

calm a man s brute nature. 

A wife salves her husband s wounds  

a mother sings her son to sleep.  

You learn quickly. 

There are some who know every 

verse of the sacred text  

but don t have a drop of the 

Mother s mercy in their blood 

and savages who can t read at all 

who understand the Father s wisdom. 

For years I pretended 

to love the poor  the afflicted. 

I had pity for them  but 

I never loved them. 

They disgusted me. 

They are hard to love. 

The poor disgust us because they are us  

shorn of our illusions. 

They show us what we d look 

like without our fine clothes. 

How d we smell without perfume. 

Can I ask you about a personal matter  

Of course. 

The king mentioned that 

since your reunion  

you haven t joined him 

in the marriage bed. 

No. 

You have a duty  Your Grace. 

To your husband  your 

king  your country  

to the gods themselves. 

It s just... 

the desires that once 

drove me no longer do. 

Congress does not require desire 

on the woman s part  only patience. 

The king must have an heir 

if we are to continue our good work. 

Forgive me. 

Sometimes the true path is hard to find. 

Hard to find 

and harder still to walk upon. 

But you ve made great progress. 

I only pray your grandmother 

follows your lead. 

My grandmother  

Yes. 

The Queen of Thorns is 

a remarkable woman  

a strong woman  

and an unrepentant sinner. 

You must teach her the new way 

as she taught you the old. 

Or I fear for her safety  

body and soul. 

Does it move or talk  

I want to speak with you alone. 

Septa Unella has been my 

true friend and counselor. 

Oh  this is madness  

You re not in your 

sanctuary now  my dear. 

All I have to do is whistle and my men 

will stroll in here and bash you about... 

  Grandmother. 

  Until I tell them to stop. 

If I tell them to stop. 

  You could use a good bashing. 

  Grandmother  please. 

What have they done to you  

You marched against the High Sparrow  

  against the Faith. 

  We marched for you. 

The gods could have punished you 

and Father  but they didn t. 

  They showed mercy. 

  And what about your brother  

What mercy did they show him  

Loras s only hope is to confess 

his crimes and repent. 

If he does  the Faith will allow 

him to return to Highgarden. 

He ll have to renounce 

his name and title... 

  Have you lost your mind  

  And live his life as a penitent. 

He is the heir to Highgarden  

the future of House Tyrell. 

He can begin again. 

As a mindless fanatic. 

As a free man. 

You will leave for Highgarden today. 

There is no law that 

says you must stay here. 

I am the queen. 

It is my duty to serve 

my husband the king. 

But you should leave  Grandmother. 

Your place is at home. 

I will never leave you. Never. 

You must. 

Go home. 

Find comfort in prayer and good works. 

The Mother watches over us all. 

I ll see you soon  my dear. 

Seven blessings to you  Grandmother. 

Shall we pray  

We said we d fight with you  King Crow  

when the time comes and we meant it  

but this isn t what we agreed to. 

These aren t white walkers. 

This isn t an army of the dead. 

This isn t our fight. 

If it weren t for him  

none of us would be here. 

All of you would be meat 

in the Night King s army. 

And I d be a pile of charred 

bones just like Mance. 

Remember Mance s camp  

It stretched all the way to the horizon. 

And look at us now. 

Look what s left of us. 

And if we lose this  we re gone. 

Dozens of tribes  

hundreds of generations. 

Be like we were never there at all. 

We ll be the last of the free folk. 

That s what ll happen to you if we lose. 

The Boltons  the Karstarks  the Umbers  

they know you re here. 

They know that more than half 

of you are women and children. 

After they finish with me  

they ll come for you. 

You re right. 

This isn t your fight. 

You shouldn t have to come 

to Winterfell with me. 

I shouldn t be asking you. 

It s not the deal we made. 

I need you with me if 

we re going to beat them  

and we need to beat them if 

you re going to survive. 

The crows killed him because 

he spoke for the free folk 

when no other southerners would. 

He died for us. 

If we are not willing to do the 

same for him  we re cowards. 

And if that s what we are  

we deserve to be the 

last of the free folk. 

Snow. 

Are you sure they ll come  

We re not clever like you southerners. 

When we say we ll do 

something  we do it. 

I heard you were leaving King s Landing. 

That is hardly your concern. 

Your grandson is still a prisoner. 

You ll leave him rotting in a cell  

Loras rots in a cell because of you. 

The High Sparrow rules 

this city because of you. 

Our two ancient houses face 

collapse because of you 

and your stupidity. 

You re right. 

I made a terrible mistake. 

I carry it with me every single day. 

Good. 

I delivered an army of 

fanatics onto our doorstep. 

And now we must fight them together. 

We need each other. 

I wonder if you re the worst 

person I ve ever met. 

At a certain age  it s hard to recall. 

But the truly vile do stand 

out through the years. 

Do you remember the 

way you smirked at me 

when my grandson and granddaughter 

were dragged off to their cells  

I do. I ll never forget it. 

You love your granddaughter. 

I love my son. 

It s the only truth I know. 

We must defend them. 

I m leaving this wretched 

city as fast as I can 

before that shoeless zealot 

throws me into one of his cells. 

If you re half as bright 

as you think you are  

you ll find a way out of here  too. 

Never. 

I ll never leave my son. 

What ll you do  then  

You have no support. Not anymore. 

Your brother s gone. The 

High Sparrow saw to that. 

The rest of your family 

have abandoned you. 

The people despise you. 

You re surrounded by 

enemies  thousands of them. 

You re going to kill 

them all by yourself  

You ve lost  Cersei. 

It s the only joy I can 

find in all this misery. 

Pick the pace up. 

Keep going. 

Keep it moving  

Now  that is a sorry attempt at a siege. 

Someone needs to teach those 

sad twats how to dig trenches. 

Someone certainly does. 

Oh  no. Not me. 

I m just an upjumped sellsword. 

You re an anointed knight. 

There s quite a difference. 

Aye  knights don t get paid. 

You have better instincts than any 

officer in the Lannister army. 

That s like saying I have a bigger cock 

than anyone in the Unsullied army. 

I expect to command all the 

Lannister forces before long. 

You can be the right hand I lost. 

You promised me a lordship and a castle 

and a highborn beauty for a wife. 

And you ll get all three. 

A Lannister always... 

Don t say it. Don t fucking say it. 

Come out and fight us  Blackfish. 

We have Lord Edmure. 

Yield the castle or we ll hang him. 

This is your last warning. 

Yield the castle. 

You think I won t do it  old man  

I sliced your niece s 

throat from ear to ear. 

And where were you  Running and 

hiding like a fucking coward. 

Yield the castle or I cut his throat. 

Go on  then. Cut his throat. 

Lothar  is it  

Ser Jaime. 

We didn t know you were coming. 

 Cause you didn t set 

a proper perimeter. 

You just allowed   men 

to approach unchallenged. 

Good thing we re friends or we d be 

fucking you in the ass right now. 

Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed. 

Walder. 

Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey. 

Only a fool makes threats he s 

not prepared to carry out. 

Now let s say I threatened to hit you 

unless you shut your mouth  

but you kept talking. 

  What do you think I d do  

  I don t give a rat s... 

I m here by the king s command 

to take back this castle. 

Have him bathed and fed. 

Unless you d like to take his place. 

Apologies  Ser Jaime. 

Do as he says. 

The siege is now under my command. 

The next time the Blackfish 

looks out from those ramparts  

he ll see an army at his 

gates  not whatever this is. 

Have your lads start digging 

perimeter trenches. 

Set pickets every hundred yards. 

And work double time on those 

siege towers and trebuchets. 

Those are our siege towers... 

As I said  the siege 

is under my command. 

If that s not to your liking  go home. 

Get word to the Blackfish. 

I want a parley. 

A parley or a fight  

He s an old man. 

You ve got one hand. 

My money s on the old boy. 

Lady Mormont. 

Welcome to Bear Island. 

I remember when you were born  my lady. 

You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. 

It was said she was a great beauty. 

I m sure you will be  too. 

I doubt it. My mother 

wasn t a great beauty 

or any other kind of beauty. 

She was a great warrior  though. 

She died fighting for your brother Robb. 

I served under your uncle at 

Castle Black  Lady Lyanna. 

He was also a great warrior 

and an honorable man. 

I was his steward. In fact... 

I think we ve had enough small talk. 

Why are you here  

Stannis Baratheon 

garrisoned at Castle Black 

before he marched on 

Winterfell and was killed. 

He showed me the letter you wrote 

to him when he petitioned for men. 

  It said... 

  I remember what it said. 

Bear Island knows no king 

but the King in the North 

whose name is Stark. 

Robb is gone  

but House Stark is not. 

And it needs your support 

now more than ever. 

I ve come with my sister to ask 

for House Mormont s allegiance. 

As far as I understand  you re a Snow 

and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. 

Or is she a Lannister  

I ve heard conflicting reports. 

I did what I had to do 

to survive  my lady. 

But I am a Stark. I 

will always be a Stark. 

If you say so. In any case  

you don t just want my allegiance. 

You want my fighting men. 

Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed 

to keep Winterfell  my lady. 

It is our duty to stop him. 

Even more so because he holds our 

brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. 

What you have to understand  

my lady  is that... 

I understand that I m responsible for 

Bear Island and all who live here. 

So why should I sacrifice one more 

Mormont life for someone else s war  

If it please  my lady  

I understand how you feel. 

I don t know you  Ser...  

Davos  my lady  of House Seaworth. 

You needn t ask your 

maester about my house. 

It s rather new. 

All right  Ser Davos of House Seaworth. 

How is it you understand how I feel  

You never thought you d find 

yourself in your position. 

Being responsible for so many 

lives at such a young age. 

I never thought I d be in my position. 

I was a crabber s son  

then I was a smuggler. 

And now I find myself 

addressing the lady 

of a great house in time of war. 

But I m here because this 

isn t someone else s war. 

It s our war. 

Go on  Ser Davos. 

Your uncle  Lord Commander Mormont  

made that man his steward. 

He chose Jon to be his 

successor because he knew 

he had the courage to do what was right  

even if it meant giving his life. 

Because Jeor Mormont and 

Jon Snow both understood 

that the real war isn t between 

a few squabbling houses. 

It s between the living and the dead. 

And make no mistake  my lady  

the dead are coming. 

Is this true  

Your uncle fought them at 

the Fist of the First Men. 

I fought them at Hardhome. 

We both lost. 

As long as the Boltons hold 

Winterfell  the North is divided. 

And a divided North won t stand a 

chance against the Night King. 

You want to protect your 

people  my lady. I understand. 

But there s no hiding from this. 

We have to fight and we 

need to do it together. 

House Mormont has kept faith with 

House Stark for   years. 

We will not break faith today. 

Thank you  my lady. 

How many fighting men can we expect  

. 

  We are not a large house  

but we re a proud one. 

And every man from Bear Island 

fights with the strength 

of  mainlanders. 

If they re half as 

ferocious as their lady  

the Boltons are doomed. 

Kingslayer. 

Blackfish. 

I assume you re here 

to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. 

I don t see Sansa and Arya. 

  I don t have them. 

  Pity. 

Do you wish to resume your captivity  

Then why are you here  

You know why I m here. 

This castle belongs to House Frey. 

You re trespassing. 

In the name of King Tommen  I 

order you to surrender or... 

Or you ll kill Edmure  

My nephew s marked for 

death no matter what. 

Hang him and be done with it. 

It won t stop with Edmure. 

You ll force me to storm the castle. 

Hundreds will die. 

Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. 

If you can breach the walls. 

We ll breach them and kill 

every last one of you. 

But if you surrender  

I ll spare the lives of your men. 

On my honor. 

Your honor  

Bargaining with oathbreakers 

is like building on quicksand. 

The war is over  ser. 

Why sacrifice living 

men to a lost cause  

As long as I m standing  

the war is not over. 

This is my home. 

I was born in this castle 

and I m ready to die in it. 

So you can either attack 

or try to starve us out. 

We have enough provisions for two years. 

Do you have two years  Kingslayer  

You clearly have no intention 

of saving your men s lives. 

Why did you come treat with me  

Sieges are dull. 

And I wanted to see you in 

person  get the measure of you. 

Well  now you have. 

Aye  now I have. 

I m disappointed. 

The answer is no. 

  Lord Glover  if you could just 

hear us out.   I ve heard enough. 

We ve only just taken back 

this castle from the ironborn. 

The Boltons helped us do it. 

Now you want me to fight against them  

I could be skinned for 

even talking to you. 

The Boltons are traitors. 

Roose Bolton... 

Have other northern houses 

pledged to fight for you  

House Mormont. 

And  

We sent ravens to Houses Manderly... 

I don t care about ravens. 

You re asking me to join your army. 

Who is fighting in this army  

The bulk of the force is 

made up of wildlings. 

Then the rumors are true. 

I didn t dare believe them. 

I received you out of 

respect for your father. 

Now I would like you to leave. 

House Glover will not 

abandon its ancestral home 

to fight alongside wildlings. 

  Lord Glover. 

  There s nothing else to say. 

I would remind you that House Glover 

is pledged to House Stark. 

Sworn to answer when called upon. 

Yes  my family served House 

Stark for centuries. 

We wept when we heard 

of your father s death. 

When my brother was lord of this 

castle  he answered Robb s call 

and hailed him King in the North. 

And where was King Robb 

when the ironborn attacked this castle  

When they threw my wife 

and children in prison 

and brutalized and killed our subjects  

Taking up with a foreign whore. 

Getting himself and those 

who followed him killed. 

I served House Stark once  

but House Stark is dead. 

Why did we have to come here  

Some of us still like it. 

Have a drink at least. 

I don t want one. 

Don t go far  love. 

I ll find you in a bit. 

Nothing on the Iron Islands 

has an ass like that. 

Doesn t interest you anymore  

I m sorry. I won t joke about it. 

I ll never hurt you  little brother. 

Don t you know that  

You think Uncle Euron s hunting for us  

Of course he is. As long as 

we re alive  we re a threat. 

He ll find us. 

It s a great big world 

and we have fast ships. 

Drink. 

I don t want any. 

I don t care what you want. Drink. 

Drink it all. 

You re ironborn  Theon. I know 

you ve had some bad years. 

Some bad years  

But I m tired of watching 

you cower like a beat dog. 

Drink the goddamn ale. 

Now listen to me. 

I need you. 

The real Theon Greyjoy  not 

this rat shit pretender. 

Can you find him for me  

Drink. 

You escaped. You hear me  

You got away and you re 

never going back. 

We ll get justice for you. 

If I got justice  my burnt body would 

hang over the gates of Winterfell. 

Fuck justice  then. We ll 

get revenge. Drink. 

Listen to me. 

If you re so broken that 

there s no coming back  

take a knife and cut your wrists. 

End it. 

But if you re staying  

Theon  I need you. 

We re gonna sail to Meereen. 

We re gonna make a pact 

with this Dragon Queen. 

And we re gonna take 

back the Iron Islands. 

Are you with me  

Are you really with me  

Now  since it s my last night 

ashore for a long while  

I m gonna go fuck the tits off this one. 

Stannis camped here on 

his way to Winterfell. 

And that s a good thing  

He was the most experienced 

commander in Westeros. 

He chose this place for a reason. 

Those mountains are a 

natural fortification. 

There s a stream down 

there for the horses. 

We re not staying here long. 

Another storm could hit any day. 

Aye  the snows defeated Stannis 

as much as the Boltons did. 

We have to march on Winterfell 

now while we still can. 

  wildlings  

 Hornwoods   Mazins... 

 Mormonts. 

It s not what we d hoped for. 

But we still have a chance 

if we re careful and smart. 

For fuck s sake. 

So he s your most trusted advisor now  

Because he secured  

men from a  year old  

Ser Davos is the reason I m 

standing here talking to you 

and he served Stannis for years. 

Stannis who lost the Blackwater  

who murdered his own brother  

who doesn t have a head  

It s not enough. We need more men. 

There s no time. 

If we went down to Castle 

Cerwyn  I know that Lord... 

We fight with the army we have. 

Friends  this is not worth fighting over  

This ll be it  now. 

Right  now we don t 

need to be fighting... 

  Who the fuck are you  

  Hold on. 

Yeah  who the fuck are you  

I was a soldier once. 

All my superiors thought I was brave. 

I wasn t. I mean  I 

never ran from a fight. 

Only because I was afraid my 

friends would see I was afraid. 

That s all I was  a coward. 

We followed orders no matter the orders. 

Burn that village. 

Fine  I m your arsonist. 

Steal that farmer s crops. 

Good  I m your thief. 

Kill those young lads so they 

won t take up arms against us. 

I m your murderer. 

I remember once a woman screaming at us  

calling us animals as we dragged 

her son from their hut. 

But we weren t animals. 

Animals are true to their nature 

and we had betrayed ours. 

I cut that young boy s throat myself 

as his mother screamed 

and my friends held her back. 

That night... 

I felt such shame. 

Shame was so heavy on me  

I couldn t eat  I couldn t sleep. 

All I could do was stare 

into that dark sky 

and listen to that mother 

screaming her son s name. 

I ll hear her screaming 

the rest of my life. 

Now  I know I can never 

bring that lad back. 

All I can do with time I ve got left 

is bring a little 

goodness into the world. 

That s all any of us can do  isn t it  

Never too late to stop robbing people  

to stop killing people. 

Start helping people. 

It s never too late to come back. 

And it s not about waiting for 

the gods to answer your prayers. 

It s not even about the gods. 

It s about you. 

Learning you have to answer 

your prayers yourself. 

Seven save you  friends. 

How can we help you  

What are you doing here  

Well  we re talking about life. 

You  

Protecting the people. 

Well  we thank you for your protection. 

Who are you protecting us from  

Do you have any horses  

No horses. 

No gold. No steel. 

Food  then. Protecting the 

people is hungry work. 

I m sure it is. 

You re welcome to stay for supper  

but we have hungry mouths here. 

Stay safe. 

The night is dark and full of terrors. 

 Seven save you  friends.  

I m a fucking septon. What 

was I supposed to say  

They don t believe in your Seven. 

They re from the Brotherhood. 

They follow the Red God. 

Aye  well  all are welcome here. 

Anyway  we got nothing for them. 

Sure  you do. You ve got food  

you ve got steel even 

if you say you don t. 

And you ve got women. 

What do you want to do  Fight them  

Kill them  

It d be you against all of them. 

I mean  these people 

don t know how to fight. 

You do. 

I m done with fighting. 

Even if it s to protect yourself  

Violence is a disease. 

You don t cure a disease by 

spreading it to more people. 

You don t cure it by dying  either. 

You ve done enough work for one day. 

Come on up for some supper. 

It s gonna be a cold night. 

We ll need firewood. 

I ll save you a bowl of stew. 

Might even have some ale hidden away. 

He s not a lying man. 

He says the Iron Fleet s 

in Slaver s Bay. 

I m inclined to believe him. 

I m not going anywhere 

near those mad fuckers. 

You re Westerosi. 

What do you care  

I want to book passage home. 

You  Can t afford it. 

Where d you steal this from  

Why do you care  

We leave in two days. 

You can have a hammock in steerage. 

I want a cabin. 

And we ll leave at dawn. 

See you at sunrise. 

Sweet girl. 

Where you gonna go  

South. 

What are you gonna do  

Get warm. 

I was with you at Hardhome. 

We saw what s out there. 

We know it s coming here. 

How can you leave us now  

I did everything I could. You know that. 

  You swore a vow.   Aye  I pledged 

my life to the Night s Watch. 

  I gave my life. 

  For all nights to come. 

They killed me  Edd  My own brothers. 

You want me to stay here after that  

Riders approaching  

Open the gate  

This is good soup. 

Do you remember those kidney 

pies Old Nan used to make  

With the peas and onions  

We never should have left Winterfell. 

Don t you wish we could go 

back to the day we left  

I want to scream at myself  

 Don t go  you idiot.  

How could we know  

I spent a lot of time thinking 

about what an ass I was to you. 

I wish I could change everything. 

We were children. 

I was awful  just admit it. 

You were occasionally awful. 

I m sure I can t have been great fun. 

Always sulking in the corner 

while the rest of you played. 

  Can you forgive me  

  There s nothing to forgive. 

  Forgive me. 

  All right. 

All right  I forgive you. 

You d think after thousands of years  

the Night s Watch would have 

learned how to make a good ale. 

Where will you go  

Where will we go  

If I don t watch over you  Father s 

ghost will come back and murder me. 

Where will we go  

I can t stay here  not 

after what happened. 

There s only one place we can go. 

Home. 

Should we tell the Boltons 

to pack up and leave  

We ll take it back from them. 

I don t have an army. 

How many wildlings did you save  

They didn t come here to serve me. 

They owe you their lives. 

You think they ll be safe here if Roose 

Bolton remains Warden of the North  

  Sansa. 

  Winterfell is our home. 

It s ours and Arya s and 

Bran s and Rickon s. 

Wherever they are  it 

belongs to our family. 

We have to fight for it. 

I m tired of fighting. 

It s all I ve done since I left home. 

I ve killed brothers 

of the Night s Watch. 

I ve killed wildlings. I ve 

killed men that I admire. 

I hanged a boy younger than Bran. 

I fought and I lost. 

If we don t take back the 

North  we ll never be safe. 

I want you to help me. 

But I ll do it myself if I have to. 

My lady. 

Ser Davos. 

Will you stay here at Castle Black  

I will do as Jon Snow commands. 

You serve Jon Snow now  

He s the prince that was promised. 

Forgive me  my lady  I 

thought that was Stannis. 

What happened down there  

There was a battle. 

Stannis was defeated. 

And Shireen  

What happened to the princess  

I saw what happened. 

I saw Stannis  forces 

defeated in the field. 

My lady  I m Ser Davos Seaworth. 

We ve met before. 

I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. 

Before Renly was assassinated 

with bloodmagic. 

That s in the past now. 

Yes  it s in the past. 

It doesn t mean I forget. 

Or forgive. 

He admitted it  you know. 

Who did  

Stannis. 

Just before I executed him. 

The Defender of the Vale  

Uncle Petyr  

My lord. 

Come and see. 

I missed your name day. Go on. 

A falcon  

A gyrfalcon. 

The greatest and rarest of birds. 

Last time I saw you  Baelish  

you told me you were taking Sansa 

Stark home with you to the Fingers. 

Indeed I was. 

And yet not long ago  

we received reports 

that she has been married to 

Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell. 

On our way to the Fingers  we were set 

upon by a large force of Bolton men. 

Seemed to know exactly 

when we were traveling 

and exactly whom we were transporting. 

Do you take me for a fool  

Tell me  Lord Royce  

how many people knew of my 

travel plans with Sansa Stark  

I shared my intentions with you 

and no one else. 

Slander a man in his own home  

you might find yourself 

crossing swords with him. 

Your home is the Vale. The Lord 

of the Vale stands before us. 

And only his judgment concerns me. 

Shall we throw him 

through the Moon Door  

My lord. 

My lord  I have always been 

faithful to House Arryn. 

To your father  to your 

mother  and now to you. 

Do you believe him  Uncle Petyr  

Lord Royce has served the Vale well. 

He s enjoyed a distinguished 

military career. 

If we could trust his absolute loyalty  

he would make a capable 

commander in the wars to come. 

You can trust my absolute 

loyalty  my lord. 

I think he deserves one more chance. 

What do you say  

Fine. 

I bring good news. 

My friends in the North tell me 

Sansa has escaped Winterfell. 

I expect she s headed to Castle Black 

where her brother serves 

as Lord Commander. 

But she won t be safe there  not 

with the Boltons after her. 

She s my cousin. 

We should help her. 

That was my instinct as well. 

Our lord has spoken. 

Gather the Knights of the Vale. 

The time has come to join the fray. 

You invite the enemy into our city  

I did. 

As a clever man once told me  

 We make peace with our 

enemies  not our friends.  

I don t make peace with 

the queen s enemies. 

I kill the queen s enemies. 

Yes  that s the military approach. 

And how has that worked here in Meereen  

I represent the diplomatic approach. 

Our queen tried to make 

peace with the Masters 

and they tried to murder her. 

We enter these negotiations 

with open eyes. 

Trust me. My own recent 

experience with slavery 

has taught me the horrors 

of that institution. 

How many days were you a slave  

Long enough to know. 

Not long enough to understand. 

I bought this dwarf for 

a single gold honor. 

And somehow you ve risen 

to the top of the Great 

Pyramid of Meereen. 

It s most impressive. 

And now you speak for the 

Good Masters of Astapor. 

Here s to reversals of fortune. 

We came here to meet the queen 

and instead we re greeted 

by a dwarf and a eunuch. 

Let s make this simple  shall we  

Tell me what you want. 

We want you to leave Slaver s Bay. 

Take your dragons and 

your mercenaries and go. 

Queen Daenerys won t 

stay in Meereen forever. 

Her path takes her westward. 

When we last met  I offered her ships 

so she could return to Westeros where 

she belongs. She refused them. 

She refused them because 

hundreds of thousands 

of men  women  and children 

still lived in chains. 

As they have since the dawn of time. 

  Not anymore. 

  You think you re a free man now  

You still follow orders. 

Just because your master 

has silver hair and tits 

doesn t mean she s not a master. 

Friends  friends  friends  please. 

There have always been those with wealth 

and power and those with nothing. 

That is the way of the world. I m not 

here to change the way of the world. 

Slavery is the way of our world. 

You don t need slaves to make money. 

There haven t been slaves in 

Westeros for hundreds of years 

and I grew up richer than any of you. 

But our queen recognizes that she erred 

by abolishing slavery 

without providing a new 

system to replace it. 

So here is the queen s proposal. 

Slavery will never return to Meereen  

but she will give the other 

cities of Slaver s Bay 

time to adjust to the new order. 

What does that mean  

Instead of abolishing slavery overnight  

we will give you seven 

years to end the practice. 

Slaveholders will be compensated 

for their losses  of 

course  at fair prices. 

In exchange  you will cut off 

your support for the Sons of the Harpy. 

We do not support the Sons of the Harpy. 

Fine  fine  but you will 

cut it off all the same. 

I do hope you accept  my friends. 

You will not receive a better offer. 

Let us sail on the tide of freedom 

instead of being drowned by it. 

And as a parting gift to 

our honored guests... 

Give freedom a chance. 

See if it doesn t taste every bit 

as good as what came before. 

Perhaps I should translate for you. 

We speak the Common Tongue. 

  Excellent. 

  You met with the slavers today. 

I did. 

Our brothers and sisters 

died fighting this scum. 

Now you invite them to our 

city and drink wine with them. 

I imagine this room was built 

so the rulers could 

intimidate the ruled. 

But I am not your ruler. 

I m not the Breaker of Chains. 

I m not the Unburnt. 

And I am certainly not 

the Mother of Dragons. 

You are a stranger here. 

So why do you represent Meereen 

in these talks with our enemies  

Because our queen chose 

me as her advisor. 

Until she returns from her travels... 

When does she return  

Soon. You have my word. 

We don t know you. We don t trust you. 

We know Torgo Nudho. 

We fight with him against the Masters. 

We trust him. 

And that is exactly why Grey Worm 

took part in these negotiations. 

As commander of the Unsullied  he 

knows how to defeat the slavers 

and he knows when it 

is time to make peace. 

You have made peace with the slavers  

We offered terms. 

  Do not use me for your lies. 

  Those men respect you. 

They respect me because 

they know who I am. 

  They know I am loyal. 

  As do I. 

I am loyal to my queen  not you. 

If you betray her work  

you are my enemy. 

I am not betraying her work. I 

am trying to save her city. 

You promised the slavers 

they could keep slavery. 

For a short time. 

Seven years is not a 

short time for a slave. 

You re right. 

Slavery is a horror that 

should be ended at once. 

War is a horror that 

should be ended at once. 

I can t do both today. 

You are wrong to trust these men. 

I don t trust the Masters. I 

trust their self interest. 

They re trustworthy if they re convinced 

that working with me is 

in their self interest. 

You don t know them. You 

don t understand them. 

We are not human in their eyes. 

They look at me and see a weapon. 

They look at her and see a whore. 

They look at me and they see 

a misshapen little beast. 

Their contempt is their weakness. 

They ll underestimate us every time and 

we will use that to our advantage. 

You will not use them. 

They will use you. That is what they do. 

You all right  

Why don t you sit and catch your breath  

I m fine. 

I don t think you could ride the dragon. 

 years ago  maybe. 

  What  

  Our queen. 

She s wild  you know. Don t 

let her size fool you. 

It s hard enough for me 

and I m a young man. 

You  I don t think your 

heart could take it. 

Must make you angry that 

our queen chose me. 

Makes me sad. You ll 

disappoint her before long. 

  She ll move on. 

  We ll all disappoint her before long. 

We need each other right now. After 

we re done needing each other... 

Oh  I don t want to fight 

you  Jorah the Andal. 

What do I have to gain  

If I win  I m the shit 

who killed an old man. 

If I lose  I m the shit who 

was killed by an old man. 

You didn t get much discipline 

as a child  did you  

None. 

The road running through the Horse Gate  

they call that the godsway. 

Eastern Market  Western Market. 

When Khal Drogo died  she was supposed 

to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen  

the widows of the dead khals. 

That s where they would have taken her  

the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. 

What are you doing  

It s forbidden to carry 

weapons in the sacred city. 

Isn t it forbidden to sneak into 

their city and steal their khaleesi  

If they spot us and we re unarmed  

we ll say we re traders heading 

for the Western Market. 

But if they see weapons... 

You re asking a dog to 

hand over his teeth. 

There s   of them down there. 

We can t fight our way out. 

We wait till dark  and 

then we ll find her. 

I m very attached to this knife. 

Don t worry. It didn t touch you. 

You know what happens  

I know what happens. 

I ll do it myself. 

I should have been born a Dothraki. 

Come on. 

Told you  I m very 

attached to this knife. 

You all right  

If they find a body with a stab wound  

the whole city will be looking for us. 

  No  don t hurt her. 

  She ll give us away. 

We have to go now. 

We will never get out 

of Vaes Dothrak alive. 

All we can do is try. 

No. 

We can do more than that. 

And you re going to help me. 

If I were to let you leave 

right now  where would you go  

What would you seek out  

I d go to my brother  

my husband  my family. 

Of course  but for you  that 

means seeking out money  

finery  power. 

Seeking out your family 

means seeking out sin. 

I m not maligning you. 

I sought those things out  too. 

To the exclusion of all else. 

My father was a cobbler. 

He died when I was young 

and I took over his shop. 

He was a simple man and 

he made simple shoes. 

But I found that the more 

work I put into my shoes  

the more people wanted them. 

Fine leather  ornamentation  

detailing  and time. 

Time most of all. 

Dozens of hours spent on a single pair. 

Quality takes time. 

Yes. 

I imagine you ve worn a year 

of someone s life on your back. 

The highborn liked to cover 

their feet with my time 

and they paid well for the privilege. 

I used their money 

to buy a taste of their 

lives for myself. 

Each time I indulged  

I felt myself ascending 

to something better. 

And one day you walked 

through a graveyard 

and realized it was all for nothing 

and set out on the 

path to righteousness. 

Book of the Stranger  verse . 

You know  The Seven Pointed Star.  

Septa Unella reads it to me. At me. 

Yes  yes  she does enjoy 

reading at people. 

You re close. 

But it wasn t a graveyard. 

It was a feast. 

I bought old fine wine 

and young pretty girls 

and invited my friends to 

come and share it all. 

We passed around the wine  

passed around the women  

and soon we fell into a stupor. 

I woke before dawn. 

I could barely stand. 

Everyone else was asleep on 

the couches or on the floor  

lying in heaps next to 

their fine clothes. 

The truth of their bodies laid bare. 

I could smell them 

beneath the incense and the perfume 

and the fine food that had 

already started to turn. 

And I saw it with perfect clarity. 

I saw what my sins were. 

The gold I had  the wine I 

drank  the women I used  

my ceaseless struggle to 

maintain my position. 

It was all part of a story. 

A story I was telling 

myself about who I was. 

A collection of lies 

that would disappear in the light. 

The people I was trying 

to climb away from  

the beggars in the street  

the poor  

they were closer to the 

truth than I ever was. 

So what did you do  

I left to go and find them. 

I didn t even put on my shoes. 

I walked out the door 

and never went back. 

Come  let s go and see him. 

  Who  

  Your brother. 

Loras. 

Loras. 

Listen to me. 

You need to stay strong. 

I can t stay strong. 

I never was strong. 

You are strong. 

You are the future of our house  

the future of our family. 

I don t care about that. 

Have you... have you told them that  

That you don t care  

I just want it to stop. 

Help me. 

They want me to help you. 

They want me to help tear you down. 

That s why he s letting me see you. 

I know it is. 

And if either of us give in to 

what they want  then they win. 

Let them win. 

Just make it stop. 

Please. 

All right. 

And now  how to avert disaster 

with our current predicament. 

This High Sparrow. 

I have dealt with fanatics of 

every description  Your Grace. 

Not setting them off  that s 

the most important thing. 

You are beset with enemies 

both within and without. 

What are you doing here  

I am advising the king on 

our current predicament. 

  Leave. 

  I am a member of the small council. 

The king... 

Is this a small council meeting  

Obviously not. 

I m here to lend my 

wisdom and my support. 

Thank you for your 

counsel  Grand Maester. 

That will be all for now. 

Your Grace. 

Since I ve missed the past 

several small council meetings  

I wanted to speak to you 

about a few things. 

I ve been thinking about 

the High Sparrow. 

As have we all  unfortunately. 

We need to be careful in 

dealing with such a man. 

To prevent things from 

escalating any further. 

We have to be careful 

not to antagonize him. 

He has Margaery. We 

can t put her at risk. 

  He s dangerous. 

  Look at me. 

What did they do to me  

To the king s own mother  

It s all right. 

It s done. It s in the past. 

And of course 

Margaery s safety is paramount. 

You don t like Margaery  do you  

Whether I like her or not 

is completely unimportant. 

Margaery is the queen. 

Queens must command respect. 

Kings even more so. 

Not just for their own 

sake  but for everyone s. 

The High Sparrow has no 

respect for kings or queens. 

No respect for anything in this world. 

He has no use for the 

things of this world. 

He wants to knock them down 

and replace them with what  

With fantasies. 

With beggars in the street. 

With nothing. 

Mother... 

there s something I want to tell you. 

Something the High Sparrow told me. 

You ve spoken with him  

I promised him I wouldn t tell anyone. 

If he found out I told... 

It would be a breach of confidence 

which he would not take lightly 

given his constant 

prattling about the truth. 

I am your mother. 

You can always trust me. 

The small council meeting has been 

postponed on the king s orders. 

I would have thought we were 

perfectly clear the first time. 

  You re not welcome.   You once 

spoke of your respect for our father 

because he understood the necessity 

of working with one s rivals. 

My dear  you have been stripped 

of your dignity and authority  

publically shamed  and 

confined to the Red Keep. 

What s left to work with  

Cersei is the mother of the king. 

She has the king s ear and his trust. 

And the king has been speaking regularly 

with the High Sparrow about 

Queen Margaery and Ser Loras. 

The High Sparrow seized power 

knowing full well we d bicker amongst 

ourselves instead of seizing it back. 

Here we are. Well done to us. 

Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms 

rests in his dirty peasant hands. 

In a few days  he ll 

have a trial for me. 

But before that  Queen Margaery 

will make her walk of atonement. 

Yes  Margaery will repent her sins 

before the good people of the city. 

Oh  no. 

That cannot happen. 

That will not happen. 

I agree. 

You ve got the second 

largest army in Westeros. 

You ll bring them into the city  

stop Queen Margaery s 

humiliation before it starts  

and take her back into Crown custody. 

The king has ordered me to take no 

action against the High Sparrow 

or the Faith Militant out of 

fear for the queen s safety. 

You will take no action at all. 

When the Tyrell armies 

come  you will stand down. 

Are you expressly forbidden 

from standing down  

No  but if the king should call... 

The whole thing will be over before 

anyone can call on you to do anything. 

When the High Sparrow is in 

custody or dead  preferably  

and Margaery s back at Tommen s side  

do you think the king will 

be angry at the outcome  

You hate these fanatics 

as much as we do. 

You hate what they ve done to your son. 

Do you want Lancel back  

Or have you given him up for good  

Of course I want him back. 

Then stand aside 

and let the people that took 

him from you be destroyed. 

If it doesn t go as planned  

the sparrows have many 

friends in this city. 

We ll have civil war. Many will die. 

Many will die no matter what we do. 

Better them than us. 

They told me you were home 

and I didn t believe it. 

 Theon Greyjoy   I said. 

 He s dead. 

He s been dead a long time.  

He let you go  

I escaped. 

I can t hear you. 

I escaped. 

Look at me. 

Look at me  

Men died trying to rescue you. 

Good men. 

My men. 

I m sorry. 

You were my brother. 

You were a spoiled little 

cunt  but you were my brother 

and I risked everything for you 

and you betrayed me. 

I know. I know and I m sorry. 

Stop saying that. 

He broke me. 

He broke me into   pieces. 

  I know. 

  You don t know. 

He sent us one of those pieces. 

That s why I came for you. 

Why did you come here  

Where else could I go  

You heard Father was dead and you 

thought you d claim the crown  

No  no. I only heard he 

died after we docked. 

You happen to show up on Pyke 

right before the kingsmoot  

I didn t know. 

You think any ironborn 

wants you to be king 

after what you ve done  

I don t want to be king. 

What do you want  

I should have listened to you. 

You re the only one... 

That doesn t matter anymore. 

Stop crying. 

Look at me. 

Tell me what you want. 

You should rule the Iron Islands. 

Let me help you. 

They ve cleaned you up nicely. 

You know who I am  

A lord. 

Yes. 

A lord. 

You ve seen my banners  

The flayed man. 

Does that worry you at all  

You eat them after  

No. 

Then I ve seen worse. 

You served the Starks  

Aye. They put me in chains 

and put a sword at my throat  

so I served them. 

The Starks have been 

gone for a long time  

but you kept protecting Rickon. 

He d fetch a good price 

to the right buyer. 

I served his family a long time. 

Didn t get no wages. 

Way I see it  I m owed. 

Be that as it may  

Rickon s not yours to sell anymore. 

He s mine. 

So what use could I 

possibly have for you  

I can give you what you want. 

And you re sure you know what that is  

Same thing men always want. 

And when they really want it  

they give it a bath first. 

You re a good talker. 

I like that. 

You re a much better 

talker than Theon Greyjoy. 

That so  

I had to work hard to get him talking. 

But he talked. 

They all do. 

He told me everything. 

All about the Stark boys  

who helped them escape  

and how she did it. 

Open the gate  

Sorry about the food. 

It s not what we re known for. 

That s all right. There are 

more important things. 

A letter for you  Lord Commander. 

I m not Lord Commander anymore. 

 To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. 

You allowed thousands of 

wildlings past the Wall. 

You have betrayed your own kind. 

You have betrayed the North. 

Winterfell is mine  bastard. 

Come and see. 

Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. 

His direwolf s skin is on my floor. 

Come and see. I want my bride back. 

Send her to me  bastard  and I will not 

trouble you or your wildling lovers. 

Keep her from me and I will 

ride north and slaughter 

every wildling man  woman  and 

babe living under your protection. 

You will watch as I skin them living. 

You...   

Go on. 

It s just more of the same. 

 You will watch as my soldiers 

take turns raping your sister. 

You will watch as my dogs 

devour your wild little brother. 

Then I will spoon your eyes from their 

sockets and let my dogs do the rest. 

Come and see. Ramsay 

Bolton  Lord of Winterfell 

and Warden of the North.  

Lord of Winterfell and 

Warden of the North. 

His father s dead. 

Ramsay killed him. 

  And now he has Rickon. 

  We don t know that. 

Yes  we do. 

How many men does he have in his army  

I heard him say   once when he 

was talking about Stannis s attack. 

How many do you have  

That can march and fight  

 . 

The rest are children and old people. 

You re the son of the last 

true Warden of the North. 

Northern families are loyal. 

They ll fight for you if you ask. 

A monster has taken our 

home and our brother. 

We have to go back to 

Winterfell and save them both. 

 i Fall back   i  

Brother  

Did you send the ravens  

Tarly  look at me. 

Did you send the ravens  

 i That was your job.  i  

Your only job. 

We need to get 

back to the Wall. 

 i It s a long march.  i  

 i We know what s out there   i  

but we have to make it  

have to warn them 

or before winter s done  

everyone you ve ever known 

will be dead.

you ll live another day. 

And if he don t... 

I smell a crow. 

We killed his friends.

Your Grace  

Did you hear that  

From now on  you d better 

kneel every time I fart. 

Stand  boy. 

We don t kneel for anyone 

beyond the Wall. 

So  you re 

Ned Stark s bastard. 

Thank you for the gift  

Lord of Bones. 

You can leave us. 

The girl likes you. 

You like her back  Snow  

That why you want 

to join us  

 i Don t panic  boy.  i  

This isn t the damned

where we make you 

swear off girls. 

This chicken eater you thought 

was king is Tormund Giantsbane. 

Can t believe this pup 

 i killed the Halfhand.  i  

He was our enemy 

and I m glad he s dead. 

He was my brother once. 

Back when he had 

a whole hand. 

What were you 

doing with him  

The Lord Commander sent me 

to the Halfhand for seasoning. 

Why  

He wants me to lead 

one day. 

But here you are  

a traitor 

kneeling before 

the King beyond the Wall. 

If I m a traitor  

then you are  too. 

Why do you want 

to join us  Jon Snow  

I want to be free. 

No  I don t think so. 

I think what you want 

most of all 

is to be a hero. 

I ll ask you 

one last time   

why do you want 

to join us  

We stopped at Craster s 

Keep on the way north. 

I saw... 

You saw what  

I saw Craster take 

his own baby boy 

and leave it 

in the woods. 

I saw what took it. 

You re telling me 

you saw one of them  

And why would that make you 

desert your brothers  

Because when I told 

the Lord Commander  

he already knew. 

Thousands of years ago  

the First Men 

battled the White Walkers 

and defeated them. 

I want to fight for the side 

that fights for the living. 

Did I come 

to the right place  

We ll need to find you 

a new cloak. 

What if you took off 

that bit there  

Don t you want to leave 

something to the imagination  

Trouble is  I ve never 

had much imagination. 

I want you to take it off. 

Mouth. 

Ser Bronn. 

Ser Bronn. 

I didn t hear that. 

  Apologies  ser. 

 i   Back away.  i  

Keep backing away till you re 

outside this establishment. 

  Then back away some more. 

  Lord Tyrion sent me. 

I will murder you  boy. 

He said it was a matter 

of life and death. 

  Pod  

 i   It s your sister.  i  

 i The queen.  i  

 i What are they doing here   i  

Protecting me  I assume. 

Will you let me in  

No  I don t think so. 

If I wanted to kill you  

do you think 

I d let a wooden door 

stop me  

They stay outside. 

I m not afraid of you  

little brother. 

  Why are you here  

  I wanted to see your face. 

They said you d lost your nose  but 

it s not as gruesome as all that. 

The man who cut me 

lost more than his nose. 

I should hope so. 

The rebels came for Joffrey s 

head  they lost their own. 

Thanks to Father. 

Thanks to Father. 

Of course  it wasn t a rebel 

who tried to kill me. 

No  Curious. 

Bit of a comedown 

from chamber of the Hand. 

But then I don t suppose 

you need much room. 

Grand Maester Pycelle 

made the same joke. 

You must be proud to be as funny as 

a man whose balls brush his knees. 

You re meeting 

Father today  

How do you know that  

 i Because I have hundreds  i  

 i of spies in my employ.  i  

The Master of Whisperers 

owes me a favor or two. 

Father told me. 

What do you want from him  

What do I want from him  

He s my father. 

Do I need 

to want something  

I m sure 

he loves me dearly  

as any father loves 

his child  

his baby boy. 

Yet he hasn t come 

to visit once 

 i since arriving  i  

 i in King s Landing.  i  

 i I lay here   i  

 i my face split in half   i  

but Father never came. 

You re going 

to make me cry. 

Why do you care 

what I want from him  

Because you ve slandered me 

to Father before. 

Slandered  

When  

 i You told him  i  

 i I had my guards  i  

beat that servant girl 

at Casterly Rock. 

 i You did have  i  

 i your guards beat her.  i  

A girl of nine  

I believe. 

 i I was nine  too.  i  

She lost an eye  

if I remember correctly. 

If I remember correctly  

she never stole 

a necklace again. 

It s not slander 

if it s true. 

And what s this truth 

you plan on telling him today  

 i Why are you so nervous  i  

 i about what I m going  i  

 i to say to Father   i  

Because you re a liar. 

I expect you ll tell lies 

about me  about Joffrey. 

Any lies in particular  

You re a clever man  

but you re not half as clever 

as you think you are. 

Still makes me 

more clever than you. 

Oh  look at these two 

shining warriors. 

Ser Taryn Mant and... 

Ser Whosit of Whocares. 

Ser Meryn Trant. 

Ser Bronn 

of the Blackwater. 

  You re no knight. 

  Pod. 

Ser Bronn 

of the Blackwater 

was anointed 

by the king himself. 

You re an up jumped 

cutthroat  

nothing more. 

That s exactly who I am. 

And you re a grub 

in fancy armor 

 i who s better at beating little 

girls than fighting men.  i  

Now  I have an appointment 

with Lord Tyrion. 

You put your hand 

on that door  

you lose the hand. 

As much as I appreciate a walk 

in the sunshine  your lordship  

I am wondering 

why you sent for me. 

A number of people 

in this city want to kill me. 

You re here to protect me. 

I ve been doing that 

for a while now. 

Do you grow bored 

protecting me  

I grow poor 

protecting you. 

Poor  

Poor  

Under my patronage 

you ve become a knight  

you ve served as Commander 

of the City Watch. 

  Briefly. 

  I m sure you filled your pockets. 

And now my pockets 

are empty. 

You ve given me a taste 

for the finer things. 

And if you want me 

to carry on protecting you  

you ll need to pay more. 

  I thought we were friends. 

  We are. 

But I m a sellsword. 

I sell my sword. 

I don t loan it out 

to friends as a favor. 

  How much  

  Double. 

  Double  

  I m a knight now. 

Knights 

are worth double. 

I don t even know how much 

I m paying you now. 

Which means 

you can afford it. 

Here. Here  

Help me  

Who are you  

I was in the battle 

at Blackwater. 

I was a captain 

and a knight. 

Aye  ser  

and serving which king  

The one true king 

of Westeros   

Stannis Baratheon. 

I thought you were dead. 

Everyone thought 

you were dead. 

And your son  

He may have swam 

ashore as you did. 

No  the wildfire took him. 

I saw it. 

I m so sorry  

my friend. 

I  too  have lost a son. 

There is nothing worse 

in this world. 

But  Davos  you were 

a good father. 

If I was a good father  

he d still be here. 

Stannis lives  

He licks his wounds 

at Dragonstone. 

Will you take me there  

There is nothing for me 

at Dragonstone. 

This war is not over. 

Not for you  maybe. 

But for Salladhor Saan  

the war is over. 

We re both sworn 

to King Stannis. 

I am sworn to no man. 

I promised you  ships and you 

promised me riches and glory. 

I delivered the ships. 

Stannis never gives up. 

Never. 

  Now he will regroup   

   i He s a broken man.  i  

His fleet lies at the bottom 

of Blackwater Bay. 

They say he sees no one   

not his generals  

not even his wife. 

Only the Red Woman 

whispering in his ear  

telling him what 

she sees in the flames 

and burning men alive. 

What  

They built a great fire 

when Stannis returned. 

All those who spoke 

against her she called 

servants of darkness. 

They say she sang 

to them as they burned. 

I m a pirate. 

 i You re a smuggler.  i  

 i Servants of darkness.  i  

I m thinking Dragonstone is a 

good place for us to avoid. 

Take me back there  please. 

You cannot turn 

Stannis against her. 

Maybe not  but I could 

carve her heart out. 

You could try. 

If you fail  

they will burn you. 

If you succeed  

they ll burn you. 

And you ve only 

just come back to life. 

Stay alive a little 

longer  my friend. 

You call me friend. You drank 

with me on my wedding day. 

And you drank with me 

on four of my wedding days  

but I don t ask you 

for favors. 

I have to stop her. 

Please  do this for me. 

When you are dead  

I will gather your bones 

in a little sack 

and let your widow 

wear them around her neck. 

We should set the siege lines 

  yards from Harrenhal. 

There won t be a siege. The 

Mountain can t defend a ruin. 

I imagine the Mountain 

will defend 

whatever Tywin Lannister 

tells him to defend. 

The Lannisters have been 

running from us since Oxcross. 

I d love a fight. 

The men would love a fight. 

I don t think 

we re going to get one. 

 Northmen 

slaughtered like sheep. 

The debt will be 

repaid  my friend. 

For them 

and for your sons. 

Will it  

They rot in the ground 

 i while their killer  i  

 i runs free.  i  

The Kingslayer won t 

remain free for long. 

My best hunters 

are after him. 

 i   A Mallister   i  

  Ser Jeremy. 

My father s bannerman. 

Find her a chamber 

that will serve as a cell. 

 i She s your mother.  i  

She freed 

Jaime Lannister. 

The Lannisters robbed 

them of their sons 

and she robbed them 

of their justice. 

 i Water.  i  

Water. 

This needs to be 

cleaned and closed. 

What s your name  friend  

Qyburn. 

You re lucky to be alive. 

Lucky  

The badge 

looks good on you. 

Almost as good 

as it looked on me. 

Are you enjoying 

your new position  

Am I enjoying it  

I was very happy 

as Hand of the King. 

Yes. 

I heard how happy you were. 

You brought a whore 

into my bed. 

It wasn t your bed 

at the time. 

I sent you here 

to advise the king. 

I gave you real power 

and authority. 

You chose 

to spend your days 

as you always have  

bedding harlots 

and drinking with thieves. 

Occasionally I drank 

with the harlots. 

What do you want  Tyrion  

Why does everyone assume 

I want something  

Can t I simply visit 

with my beloved father  

My beloved father who 

somehow forgot to visit 

his wounded son 

after he fell 

on the battlefield. 

Maester Pycelle assured me 

your wounds were not fatal. 

I organized 

the defense of this city 

while you held court 

in the ruins of Harrenhal. 

I led the foray when the 

enemies were at the gate 

while your grandson  

the king  

quivered in fear 

behind the walls. 

I bled in the mud 

for our family. 

And as my reward  

I was trundled off 

to some dark little cell. 

But what do I want  

A little bloody gratitude 

would be a start. 

Jugglers and singers 

require applause. 

You are a Lannister. 

 i Do you think I demanded  i  

 i a garland of roses  i  

 i every time I suffered  i  

 i a wound on a battlefield   i  

Hmm  

Now  I have seven kingdoms 

to look after 

and three of them 

are in open rebellion. 

So tell me what you want. 

I want what is mine 

by right. 

Jaime is your eldest son  

heir to your lands and titles. 

But he is a Kingsguard  forbidden 

from marriage or inheritance. 

The day Jaime put on 

the white cloak  

he gave up his claim 

to Casterly Rock. 

I am your son 

and lawful heir. 

You want Casterly Rock  

It is mine by right. 

We ll find you 

accommodations 

more suited 

to your name 

 i and as a reward  i  

 i for your accomplishments  i  

during the battle 

of Blackwater Bay. 

And when the time is right  

you will be given a position 

 i fit for your talents  i  

so that you can 

serve your family 

and protect our legacy. 

 i And if you serve  i  

 i faithfully   i  

 i you will be rewarded  i  

 i with a suitable wife.  i  

And I would let myself 

be consumed by maggots 

 i before mocking  i  

 i the family name  i  

 i and making you  i  

 i heir to Casterly Rock.  i  

  Why  

  Why  

You ask that  

You  who killed your mother 

to come into the world  

You are an ill made  

spiteful little creature 

full of envy  lust  

and low cunning. 

 i Men s laws give you  i  

 i the right to bear my name  i  

and display my colors since I 

cannot prove that you are not mine. 

 i And to teach me humility   i  

 i the gods have condemned me  i  

to watch you waddle about 

wearing that proud lion 

that was my father s sigil 

and his father s before him. 

But neither gods nor men 

will ever compel me 

to let you turn Casterly Rock 

 i into your whorehouse.  i  

Go  now. 

Speak no more of your rights 

to Casterly Rock. 

Go. 

Oh  one more thing. 

The next whore I catch 

in your bed I ll hang. 

 i Dorne.  i  

 i It s going to Dorne.  i  

 i   Why Dorne   i  

  It s carrying silk 

and it s supposed to bring 

back wine in exchange. 

But it s not 

coming back. 

The captain s tired 

of risking his life 

so King s Landing 

lords and ladies 

can get drunk on better 

wine than they deserve. 

He s going 

to stay in Dorne. 

Wait out the winter where 

it s beautiful and warm. 

I met some people in Dorne who 

weren t so beautiful and warm. 

Don t ruin the game. 

I told you  

I don t want to play. 

What about that one there  

That one  

It s going to Volantis. 

Why  

Because when I got 

on a ship in Volantis  

it looked like that one. 

That s not how 

the game works. 

You re not supposed to just 

blurt out the right answer. 

You ve got 

to invent a story 

about where the ship 

is going and why. 

Why should I make up a story 

when I know the truth  

Because the truth 

is always either 

terrible or boring. 

Lovely day for it. 

Watching the ships. 

Lord Baelish. 

Might I speak 

with Lady Sansa 

alone for a moment  

I saw your mother 

not long ago. 

She s very eager 

to see you. 

And your sister. 

Arya s alive  

You said 

you d take me home. 

You said King s Landing 

was your home. 

You are the property 

of the crown. 

Stealing you 

would be treason. 

If you were to tell 

just one person   

  I won t tell anyone. 

  How do I know  

Because I m a terrible liar. 

You said so yourself. 

Please  Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. 

Tell me when. 

I m waiting for word 

on an assignment 

that will take me far away 

from the capital. 

When I set sail  

I might be able 

to take you with me. 

But you ll need to be ready to 

leave on a moment s notice. 

You re her handmaiden  

Yes. 

And you re his...  

I help manage 

his affairs. 

  He s an important person. 

  So is she. 

I grew up in the shadow 

of her father s castle. 

The day she was born  

they rang the bells 

from sunrise till sunset. 

We ve both done 

rather well  you and I. 

Yes. 

Given where we started. 

And where is that  

It s not easy 

for girls like us 

to dig our way out. 

 i Watch out for her.  i  

I always do. 

Watch out for her 

with him. 

They re growing fast. 

Not fast enough. 

I can t wait that long. 

I need an army. 

We ll be in Astapor 

by nightfall. 

Some say the Unsullied are the 

greatest soldiers in the world. 

The greatest slave soldiers 

in the world. 

The distinction means 

a good deal to some people. 

Do those people 

have any better ideas 

about how to put you 

on the Iron Throne  

It s too beautiful 

a day to argue. 

You re right. 

Another lovely day 

on the high seas. 

 i Don t mock them.  i  

They re the first Dothraki 

who have ever been on a ship. 

They followed me 

across the poison water. 

If they ll do it  

others will. 

And with a true 

khalasar   

The Dothraki follow strength 

above all  khaleesi. 

You ll have a true khalasar 

when you prove yourself strong. 

And not before. 

Your Grace. 

I heard you were dead. 

Not yet. 

I had hoped to speak 

to you alone  Your Grace. 

We are alone. 

Your Grace  you are 

the rightful king. 

 i Not only by blood.  i  

You re an honorable man  

a just man. 

And there is still 

a war to fight. 

I am fighting. 

By burning 

prisoners alive  

How would you punish 

the infidels  Ser Davos  

I do not judge people 

for the gods they worship. 

If I did  I d have 

thrown you in the sea 

before you ever set foot 

on Dragonstone. 

  I m not your enemy. 

  You are my enemy. 

Was it me you fought 

on Blackwater Bay  

 i Did I set  i  

 i your ships ablaze   i  

I wasn t there when the wildfire 

killed our men by the thousands. 

I could have 

saved those men. 

You would have 

taken the city  

Stannis would now sit 

upon his rightful throne  

and you would 

stand beside him. 

 i But I wasn t there  i  

because you convinced 

your king to leave me behind. 

Do you hear them screaming  

All those burning men 

in the water 

crying for their mothers  

for their gods for help  

Until the moment 

the Blackwater swallowed them. 

Don t despair  Ser Davos. 

What I told 

your son is true. 

Death by fire 

is the purest death. 

This woman is evil  

She s the mother of demons. 

Take him to the dungeon 

and lock him in a cell. 

  Your Grace  

  Come on. 

You ve chosen 

the darkness  Ser Davos. 

  She will destroy us all  

  I will pray for you. 

 i Your Grace   i  

 i Halt. Down.  i  

 i Halt. Down.  i  

Why have we stopped  

It s Lady Margaery  

Your Grace. 

 i What is she doing   i  

 i Who gave her permission   i  

My lady. We should have 

guards  my lady. 

Why  

Pardon me. 

Stop  my lady. 

You ll ruin your dress. 

I have others. 

Would you like to speak 

with her  Your Grace  

No. 

He was a soldier. 

He went to fight 

on the walls 

when the ships came 

into Blackwater Bay. 

He never came back. 

And your mother  

She died 

when she had me. 

Bad men wanted 

to come into this city 

and do terrible things  

but your father stopped them. 

Whenever you look 

at this knight  

I want you to remember 

your father. 

He wasn t a knight. 

He was just a soldier. 

And what do knights 

swear to do  

Protect the weak 

and uphold the good. 

Your father did that. 

Be proud of him. 

Was your father 

a soldier  too  

You should be proud  too. 

Under King Joffrey s 

leadership  

your fathers 

saved the city. 

They saved us all. 

From now on  we re going 

to take care of you. 

All of you. 

Come to me for whatever 

you need to feed them  

clothe them  

or house them. 

Directly to me. 

  Your Grace. 

  Your Grace. 

Please  sit. 

Sit. 

I do apologize  

my lady. 

Small council meetings. 

At what point 

does it become treason 

to waste the king s time  

That s a lovely gown  

my lady. 

Yes  it suits you 

perfectly. 

I imagine you might 

be rather cold. 

The climate is a bit more forgiving 

back in Highgarden  Your Grace. 

Shall I have them bring 

you a shawl  my lady  

I am touched by your 

concern  Your Grace. 

Luckily for us Tyrells  

our blood runs quite warm. 

   i Doesn t it  Loras   i  

  Yes. 

Loras  isn t the queen s 

gown magnificent  

The fabric  the embroidery  

the metalwork. 

I ve never seen 

anything like it. 

You might find a bit 

of armor quite useful 

once you become queen. 

Perhaps before. 

 i Joffrey tells me you stopped 

your carriage at Flea Bottom  i  

on your way back from 

the sept this morning. 

Yes. I paid a visit 

to an orphanage 

the High Septon 

told me about. 

Margaery does a great deal of work 

with the poor back in Highgarden. 

The lowest among us are no different from 

the highest if you give them a chance 

and approach them 

with an open heart. 

 i An open heart is what  i  

 i you ll get in Flea Bottom  i  

 i if you re not careful   i  

 i my dear.  i  

Not long ago  we were 

attacked by a mob there. 

We had a full complement 

of guards that didn t stop them. 

The king barely escaped 

with his life. 

My mother s always had 

a penchant for drama. 

Facts become less and less 

important to her 

 i as she grows older.  i  

Our lives were never 

truly in danger. 

You re right  of course. 

But you are 

your father s son. 

We can t all have 

a king s bravery. 

Hunger turns men 

into beasts. 

I m glad House Tyrell has been 

able to help in this regard. 

They tell me  wagons arrive 

daily now from the Reach. 

 i Wheat  barley  apples.  i  

 i We ve had a blessed harvest.  i  

And  of course  it s our 

duty to assist the capital 

in time of need. 

Well  as Ser Loras said  

Lady Margaery has done 

this sort of... 

charitable work before. 

I m sure she knows 

what she s doing. 

I m sure she does. 

The Unsullied have stood here 

for a day and a night 

with no food or water. 

They will stand 

until they drop. 

Such is their 

obedience. 

They may suit my needs. 

Tell me of their training. 

They begin their 

training at five. 

Every day they drill 

from dawn to dusk 

until they have mastered 

the shortsword  

the shield  

and the three spears. 

Only one boy in four survives 

this rigorous training. 

 i Their discipline  i  

 i and loyalty are absolute.  i  

 i They fear nothing.  i  

Even the bravest men 

fear death. 

 i My master says  i  

 i the Unsullied are not men.  i  

Death means nothing 

to them. 

He begs you attend to this 

carefully  Your Grace. 

Tell the good master 

there is no need. 

 i My master points out  i  

 i that men don t need nipples.  i  

To win his shield  

an Unsullied must go to the 

slave marts with a silver mark  

find a newborn and kill it 

before its mother s eyes. 

 i This way  my master says   i  

 i we make certain  i  

 i there is no weakness  i  

 i left in them.  i  

You take a babe 

from its mother s arms  

kill it as she watches  and pay 

for her pain with a silver coin  

My master would like you to 

know that the silver is paid 

to the baby s owner  

not the mother. 

How many do you 

have to sell  

 . 

Master Kraznys asks 

that you please hurry. 

Many other buyers 

are interested. 

  dead babies. 

The Unsullied 

are a means to an end. 

Once I own them  

these men   

They re not men. 

Not anymore. 

Once I own an army of 

slaves  what will I be  

Do you think these slaves 

will have better lives 

serving Kraznys and men 

like him or serving you  

You ll be fair to them. 

You won t mutilate them 

to make a point. 

You won t order them 

to murder babies. 

You ll see they re properly 

fed and sheltered. 

A great injustice 

has been done to them. 

Closing your eyes 

will not undo it. 

The warlocks. 

I owe you my life  ser. 

The honor is mine  

my queen. 

You know this man  

I know him 

as one of the greatest fighters 

the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen 

and as the Lord Commander 

of Robert Baratheon s 

Kingsguard. 

King Robert is dead. 

I have been searching 

for you  Daenerys Stormborn  

to ask your forgiveness. 

I was sworn to protect 

your family. 

I failed them. 

I am Barristan Selmy  

Kingsguard to your father. 

 i Allow me to join  i  

 i your Queensguard  i  

and I will not 

fail you again. 

In old times  whenever 

Braavos stood in danger  

the Titan would step with fire in its eyes  

wade into the sea and smash the enemies. 

It s just a statue. 

Haha. Don t be afraid. He s 

announcing our arrival. 

I m not afraid. 

The House of Black and White. 

This is where you ll find 

the man you seek. 

Here  I leave you. 

  Thank you for bringing me. 

  Any man in Braavos would have done the same. 

  Valar morghulis. 

  Valar dohaeris. 

Hello. 

Valar morghulis. 

Jaqen H ghar gave me this. 

  No one here by that name. 

  Please  

I ve crossed the narrow sea. 

I have nowhere else to go. 

  You have everywhere else to go. 

  But wait  

Cersei...Walder Frey... 

The Mountain...Meryn Trant. 

Cersei...Walder Frey... 

The Mountain...Meryn Trant. 

Cersei... 

Walder Frey... 

The Mountain... 

Meryn Trant. 

Cersei... 

Walder Frey... 

The Mountain... 

Meryn Trant. 

Cersei... 

Walder Frey... 

The Mountain... 

Meryn Trant... 

Must be good food if it s crowded. 

Ale  

Ale  

Before we left  a maester 

gave you a raven s scroll. 

You are becoming an observant young lady. 

My mother used to say  dark wings dark words . 

An old saying. Inaccurate in this case. 

So it s good news. 

My marriage proposal has been accepted. 

I thought you still mourned the 

death of my beloved Aunt Lysa. 

  Ale  

  I ll have some. 

My Lady... 

  What is it  

  Sansa Stark. Don t look  

You sure  

She s dyed her hair  but it s her. 

She s sitting with Petyr Baelish. 

Littlefinger  

A bunch of knights with them. 

Bunch  Bunch...Six  Twenty  

Ten  I think. Too many. 

My Lady  I don t think this is... 

Ready the horses  

We only have one horse. 

Find more  

Do you like the taste  

Don t see what all the fuss is about. 

Why do men love it so much  

It gives some men courage. 

Does it give you courage  

That s far enough. 

Lord Baelish. 

Lady Sansa. 

My name is Brienne of Tarth. 

We ve met  with Renly Baratheon. 

What did he say about you  

He said  

Your loyalty came free of charge. 

Someone appears to have paid 

quite a bit for it since then. 

Lady Sansa. 

Before your mother s death  

I was her sworn sword. 

I gave my word I will 

find you and protect you. 

I will shield your back 

and keep your counsel  

and give my life for you if needs be. 

I swear it by the Old Gods and the New. 

Please  lady Brienne. 

No need for such formality. 

You were Catelyn Stark s sworn sword. 

  I was. 

  Strange. 

I knew Cat since the time we were children. 

She never mentioned you. 

It was after Renly s murder. 

Ah  yes. 

You were accused of killing him. 

I tried to save him. 

  But you were accused. 

  By men who did not see what happened. 

And what did happen  

He was murdered by a shadow. 

A shadow with the face 

of Stannis Baratheon. 

A shadow  

With a face  

This woman swore to protect Renly  

she failed. 

She swore to protect your mother  

she failed. 

Why would I want somebody with your 

history of failure guarding Lady Sansa  

Why should you have any 

say in her affairs  

Because I am her uncle. 

I married her Aunt Lysa shortly 

before my beloved s untimely death. 

We re family now. And you are an outsider. 

Forgive me  Lady Brienne. 

But experience has made 

me wary of outsiders. 

Lady Sansa... 

  if we can have a word alone... 

  No. 

  Please  my Lady  if I can explain... 

  I saw you at Joffrey s wedding... 

bowing to the king. 

Neither of us wanted to be there. 

  Sometimes we don t have a choice. 

  And sometimes we do. 

You should leave. 

We don t want our new friend 

wandering the countryside alone. 

The roads in these parts aren t safe. 

Why don t you stay  

I m gonna ask you to stay. 

Stop  Stop  After him  

Podrick  

Stop  stop  stop  stop  

Stop  

That s a good boy. Come on. 

Come on  

No  no  no  stop  

Guess that means you re unarmed. 

Don t  Put that down  

Podrick  

Yes  my Lady  

You can stand now. 

Yes  my Lady. 

Sansa Stark  

Wary of strangers  as she should be. 

I saw her riding on the 

Eastroad with Littlefinger. 

  We ll follow them. 

  My Lady... 

if both Stark girls refused your service  

maybe you re released from your vow. 

I swore to their mother 

I would protect those girls. 

They don t want your protection. 

You think she s safe with Littlefinger  

No  my Lady. 

Get your horse. 

A summons from the Queen. 

There are only two like it in the world. 

The one I m wearing and the 

one I gave to Myrcella. 

It s a threat. 

Of course it s a threat. 

Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded 

by people who hate our family. 

It s a threat  

No note  

They blame us for the death 

of Oberyn and his sister. 

And every other tragedy that 

has befallen their accursed country. 

I will burn their cities to 

the ground if they touch her. 

Softer. 

What  

Not so loud. 

Our daughter is in danger and you re worried 

I am speaking too loudly  

No one can know she s our daughter. 

Then don t call her your daughter. 

You ve never been a father to her. 

If I was a father to any of my children  

they d be stoned in the streets. 

And what has your caution brought  

Our eldest child murdered 

at his own wedding  

our only daughter shipped off to Dorne  

our baby boy set to marry that 

smirking whore from Highgarden  

I m gonna make things better. 

You ve never made anything better. 

I m going to Dorne. 

And I m bringing our daughter home. 

You can t just ask Prince 

Doran to give her back. 

She s promised to his son. 

I m not going to ask him anything. 

You go down there with an army 

it s an act of war. 

No army. 

Do you know where they re keeping her  

Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens. 

I ll find her. 

Is there anything else  Your Grace  

You re going to Dorne. 

A one handed man. 

Alone. 

Who said I was going alone  

No sunflowers. I don t like yellow. 

Roses are very nice  

definitely roses. 

And music. I adore music. 

But no flutes. 

I hate flutes. We can have a harp  

if you like  but no flutes. 

Then there s the food. 

The food is the most important thing  

don t you agree  

We re gonna need pigeon pies. 

That s what they eat in the capital  

don t they  

Don t they  

Don t who  

People eat pigeon pie in the capital. 

They certainly do  my dear. 

They certainly do. 

It s a fine place  isn t it  

A fine place. 

I never thought I d end up settling down 

in a place like this. 

You won t. 

Pardon  

We won t get to live at Stokeworth. 

When mother dies  my sister gets the castle 

because she s older. 

She hates me. 

She calls me mean names and sometimes 

even still she pulls my hair 

when mother s not looking. 

You know what I think  

I think you re a good person. 

And your sister is a mean person. 

She is. 

I ve been all over the world 

and if there s one thing I ve learned  

is that meanness comes around. 

People like your sister  

they always get what s coming for them  

eventually. 

One way or another. 

Who s that  

Jaime fucking Lannister. 

Ser Jaime  

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. 

I was very sorry to hear about your father. 

Thank you. 

This is my betrothed  Lollys. 

A pleasure. 

Run along  love. 

Beautiful young bride you ve chosen. 

When are you planning on getting married  

Just get on with it. 

On with what  

What you re here for. 

There s no way this little visit 

could possibly mean anything good for me. 

It s very good for you. 

Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken. 

Mmm. 

We ve made a deal  your sister and I. 

I would have advised against that. 

How is this good for me  

Because you re going to come with me 

and help me with something important. 

And when we return... 

I m gonna give you a much better girl 

and a much better castle. 

Return from where  

As far south as south goes. 

 i You are my queen.  i  

The prince does not 

wish to be disturbed. 

Remove yourself from my path 

or I ll take that long axe 

and I ll shove it up your... 

 i Captain...  i  

let her pass. 

Your brother was murdered... 

and you sit here 

in the Water Gardens 

staring at the sky 

and doing nothing. 

Oberyn was slain 

during a trial by combat 

by law  that is no murder. 

  Your brother... 

  You don t have to remind me. 

He was my brother long 

before he was anything to you. 

What will you know about his death  

I will bury him. 

I will mourn for him. 

And then  

You would have me go to war. 

The whole country 

would have you go to war. 

Then we are lucky 

the whole country does not decide. 

The Sand Snakes are with me. 

They have the love of their people. 

They will avenge their father 

while you sit here 

in your chair doing nothing. 

Oberyn is dead. 

And this Lannister girl 

skips about the Water Gardens 

eating our food  

breathing our air. 

How many of your 

brothers and sisters 

do they have to kill  

 i Let me have her.  i  

Let me send her to Cersei 

one finger at a time. 

I loved my brother. 

And you made him very happy. 

For that  you will always 

have a place in my heart. 

But we do not mutilate 

little girls for vengeance. 

Not here. 

Not while I rule. 

And how long would that be  

The Unsullied are too conspicuous. 

Anyone can see them coming from a mile off. 

 Course you haven t found any 

Sons of the Harpy. 

You haven t  have you  

My Second Sons 

on the other hand... 

they drink  they whore  

fight in streets  

they blend in. 

They overhear things in taverns. 

Follow people from the taverns 

to nice quiet alleys. 

Break a few fingers  

overhear a few more things... 

before you know it... 

No one here. 

We go. 

In a hurry  

You re afraid  

Unsullied fear nothing. 

Right. 

That s your problem. 

You understood fear once  long ago  

but you forgot what it means. 

Someone who s forgotten fear... 

has forgotten how to hide. 

Fear is useful that way. 

Sons of the Harpy... 

they want to put a collar 

back on my neck. 

On all of our necks. 

Please  Your Grace... 

   i you must kill him.  i  

  It would send a message. 

I think you should 

exercise restraint... 

   i Your Grace.  i  

  Why  

Well  for one thing  he 

may have valuable information. 

Well  the Son of the Harpy 

has no more valuable information. 

How do you know that  

Because I questioned him. 

And the information you did get... 

he is young and.. 

He is born free. 

Why should he want 

to bring back slavery  

What did it do for him  

Perhaps the only thing 

that gave him pride 

was knowing that there was 

someone lower than he was. 

 i They pay him.  i  

Great families  afraid to do a thing. 

They pay poor men 

to do it for them. 

And how do you know this  

   i Everyone know this.  i  

  I don t know it. 

 i And I m the head of a great family.  i  

 i We do not know what 

this man did or didn t do.  i  

Give him a trial at least. 

A fair trial. 

Show all the citizens of Meereen 

that you are better than those 

who would depose you. 

Teach them a better way. 

I do not know the place 

from where old ser comes. 

Things maybe are different there  I hope. 

But here  in Meereen  

before Daenerys Stormborn 

they own us. 

So we learn much about them... 

or we do not live long. 

They teach me what they are. 

Mercy  fair trial... 

these mean nothing to them. 

All they understand is blood. 

Thank you all for your council. 

 i Your Grace...  i  

a word  please  I beg you. 

About what  

About your father. 

  About the Mad King. 

  The Mad King  

You re here to remind me 

of my enemies  lies  

Consider me reminded. 

Your Grace... 

I served in his Kingsguard. 

I was at his side 

from the first. 

Your enemies did not lie. 

Go on. 

When the people rose 

and revolted against him 

your father set their tongues 

cast them in flames. 

He murdered sons 

in front of their fathers. 

He burned men alive 

with wildfire 

and laughed as they screamed  

and his efforts to stamp out dissent 

led to a rebellion 

that killed every Targaryen... 

except two. 

I m not my father. 

No  Your Grace  thank the gods. 

But the Mad King gave his enemies 

the justice he thought they deserved. 

And each time  

it made him feel powerful... 

and right... 

until the very end. 

I will not have the Son of the Harpy 

executed without a fair trial. 

Your Grace. 

There s a bug. 

Yes  best be careful. 

You might accidentally 

consume some solid food. 

When I agreed to come with you  

did I misrepresent my intentions  

Besides  what else is there for me 

to do inside this fucking box  

  You don t like it  

  I want to take a walk. 

You can t. 

Cersei has offered a lordship 

to the man who brings her your head. 

She ought to offer her cunt. 

Best part of her 

for the best part of me. 

Well  I suppose a box is as good 

a place for me as anywhere. 

Are we really going to 

spend the entire road to Volantis 

talking about the 

futility of everything. 

You re right  there s no point. 

The road to Volantis  

You said we are going to Meereen. 

What s in Volantis  

The road to Meereen. 

And what do you hope to find 

at the end of the road to Meereen  

I told you. 

A ruler. 

But you ve already got a ruler. 

Everywhere has already got a ruler. 

Every pile of shit 

on the side of every road 

has someone s banner 

hanging from it. 

You are quite good  do you know  

At ruling. 

During your brief tenure as Hand. 

I didn t rule  I was a servant. 

Still  a man of talent. 

Managed to kill a lot of people  

Yes  but you showed great 

promise in other areas as well. 

She wanted me 

to leave King s Landing. 

She begged me. 

I wouldn t go. 

Why  

 Cause I liked it. 

Power... 

even as a servant. 

People follow leaders 

and they will never follow us. 

They find us repulsive. 

I find us repulsive. 

And we find them... 

repulsive  which is why 

we surround ourselves 

with large comfortable boxes 

to keep them away. 

And yet... 

no matter what we do... 

people like you and me are never 

really satisfied inside the box. 

Not for long. 

You re right. 

  Let s go for a walk. 

  No. 

How many dwarves 

are there in the world  

Is Cersei 

going to kill them all  

Not him. 

You re trying 

to deceive your queen  

Should I throw them 

in a cell  Your Grace  

It won t be necessary  

Ser Meryn. 

I don t want to dissuade 

the other hunters. 

Mistakes will be made. 

  Thank you  Your Grace. 

  Thanks. 

  Thank you  Your Grace. 

  Thank you. 

Take the head. 

Let me  Your Grace. 

I would take it 

if you don t mind. 

It could prove 

useful for my work. 

Very good. 

Over there would be fine. 

You heard the man  over there. 

You re the hand of the King. 

No  uncle. 

Clearly  it would not be appropriate 

for a woman to assume that role. 

I m merely advising my son until he comes 

of age and chooses a Hand for himself. 

Your Grace  I would be willing 

to serve provisionally as the King s Hand 

  until he becomes full... 

  You re a good man  Lord Tyrell  

but I don t imagine 

we ll have the time. 

In addition to be Master of Ships  

the King has appointed 

you Master of Coin. 

Oh  Your Grace. 

He called your experience and wisdom 

in financial matters unparalleled. 

He said he would be honored to have you 

represent the Crown s interest in the same. 

The honor is all mine  

Your Grace. 

 i Y Y Your Grace  

in the past  on several occasions   i  

a Grand Maester has 

served as the King s Hand. 

The King s named Qyburn 

the new Master of Whispers. 

Your Grace  

this this man  

Th This embarassment to the Citadel  

Your Grace... 

what qualifications can he 

possibly have for this post  

The qualification of loyalty  

Grand Maester. 

That s far more than 

the eunuch ever had. 

Far more than many ever have. 

I must say... 

I can not... 

Uncle Kevan  

in light of your position as 

Commander of the Lannister Armies  

it would please the King if you 

would serve as his Master of War. 

No man living 

better deserves the title. 

That is kind of you to say. 

I would like to hear it 

from the King himself. 

Well  the King is very 

busy at this moment. 

He should be here  

learning what it means to rule. 

He is learning. 

On this occasion  

in his capacity as ruler  

he s asked me 

to speak on his behalf. 

I returned to the capital 

to pay my respects to my brother  

and to you  

and to serve the King. 

I did not return to the capital 

to serve as your puppet. 

To watch you stack the 

Small Council with sycophants. 

Sending your own brother away... 

My brother has left the capital 

to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission. 

 i What mission   i  

That is not your concern 

as Master of War. 

I do not recognize 

your authority to dictate 

what is and is not my concern. 

You are the Queen Mother. 

Nothing more. 

You would abandon your king 

in his time of need  

If he wants to send for me  

I ll be waiting for him. 

At Casterly Rock. 

Come on  you know this one. 

It looks like an animal. 

Snake. 

S S Sn... 

 S . 

  It s an  S . 

   i Right  very good.  i  

Hmm  did you know 

that the youngest 

Lord Commander in history  

Osric Stark  

was elected at the age of   

I know  S . 

You ll learn  I promise. 

I taught Ser Davos. 

Old people are terrible 

at learning new things. 

Well  you are a wonderful teacher. 

Very patient. 

I only said that the more 

time that you spend practicing 

 i the faster you will 

be able to read.  i  

That s all right. 

We re doing just fine. 

I m sure you and Ostrich Stark 

have a lot to talk about. 

How old were you 

when you learned how to read  

   i .  i  

Were you taught by your mother  

No. 

Our Maester Cressen did. 

I had a lot of time to practice. 

My mother kept me inside because... 

What do you call it in the south  

What happened to your face. 

Grayscale. 

What would you call it 

in the north of the Wall  

I don t know. 

But two of my sisters had it. 

They both died. 

How did they cure you  

I don t remember. 

I was a baby. 

A lot of people came and tried  I think. 

Whatever they did  it went away. 

What happened to your sisters  

My father made them move out 

to the keep  outside. 

None of us were allowed 

to go near them. 

But we heard them  

especially at night. 

They started to sound 

not like themselves. 

Did you ever see them  

Only once  at the end. 

They were covered with it. 

Their faces  their arms  

they acted like animals. 

My father had to drag them out 

to the woods on a rope. 

What did he do with 

them in the woods  

Mother. 

Leave us. 

Your Grace. 

You need to stay 

away from that girl. 

  Why  

  She s a wildling. 

Her name s Gilly. 

She s nice. 

I m teaching her to read. 

She s a wildling. 

Your father defeated her people. 

He executed their king 

for treason. 

They could strike at him 

by striking at you. 

Gilly wouldn t do that. 

You have no idea 

what people will do. 

All your books 

and you still don t know. 

I ordered Mance Rayder 

burned at the stake. 

You prevented that order 

from being carried out. 

You showed mercy 

to Mance Rayder. 

The King s word is law. 

Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos 

how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. 

Show too much kindness  

people won t fear you. 

If they don t fear you  

they don t follow you. 

With respect  Your Grace  

the free folk will never follow you 

no matter what you do. 

You re the man 

who burned their king alive. 

Who then  

You  

No. 

Only one of their own. 

Do you know this wretched girl  

  Lyanna Mormont. 

  Lord Commander s niece. 

Lady of Bear Island. 

And a child of ten. 

I asked her to commit her house 

to my court. That s her response. 

Bear Island knows no king 

but the King in the North  

whose name is Stark. 

That amuses you. 

I apologize  Your Grace. 

Northerners commit 

a bit like the free folk. 

Loyal to their own. 

I know. 

My brother  Robert  went on often 

and loudly about how difficult it was 

to control them. 

Even with your father s help. 

Tonight  the Night s Watch 

elect a new Lord Commander. 

Ser Alliser Thorne 

is going to win. 

  Most likely. 

  One pleasant man. 

He thinks you re a traitor. 

What s your life gonna 

be like here at the Wall  

  with Thorne in command  

  Unpleasant  I expect. 

Your bravery made him look weak. 

He ll punish you for it. 

I don t punish men for bravery. 

I reward them. 

I don t doubt that  Your Grace. 

But I am a brother 

of the Night s Watch. 

I have pledged them my life  

my honor  my sword. 

I don t know what 

I have left to give you. 

You can give me the North. 

I can t. 

Even if I wanted to  

I m a bastard. 

A Snow. 

Kneel before me. 

Lay your sword at my feet. 

Pledge me your service 

and you ll rise again as Jon Stark  

Lord of Winterfell. 

He ll make you a Stark 

with a stroke of a pen. 

It s the first thing 

I ever remember wanting. 

I daydreamed that my father 

would ask the king. 

Just like that I would never be 

the Bastard of Winterfell again. 

No  you deserve that. 

You do. 

I I couldn t be happier for you. 

I m gonna refuse him. 

But... 

you d be Lord of Winterfell. 

I swore a vow 

to the Night s Watch. 

If I don t take 

my own word seriously  

what sort of Lord of Winterfell 

would that be  

 i Hey.  i  

Crowded  

You d think we were serving venison stew. 

Does anyone wish to speak 

for candidates... 

before we cast our tokens... 

for the  Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch  

Ser Alliser Thorne 

is not just a knight  

he s a man of true nobility. 

 i He was Acting Commander 

when the Wall came under attack  i  

and led us to victory 

against the wildlings. 

 i Yes.  i  

He s a veteran of  battles 

and has been a defender of the Watch 

and the Wall almost all of his life. 

 i Nice.  i  

  He s the only true choice. 

   i Yes.  i  

 i Yes.  i  

Ser Denys Mallister 

joined the Watch as a boy 

and has served loyally 

longer than any other Ranger. 

   i That s right.  i  

  Through ten winters he served. 

As Commander of the Shadow Tower... 

he kept the wildlings away. 

We could do no better. 

If there s no one else... 

we will begin the voting. 

The triangular tokens count 

for Ser Alliser Thorne. 

The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. 

Maester Aemon... 

Samwell Tarly  go on. 

Sam the Slayer. 

Another wildling lover  

just like his friend  Jon Snow. 

How s your lady love  Slayer  

Her name is Gilly. 

Ser Slynt knows her quite well. 

They cowered together in the larder 

during the battle for the Wall. 

Lies  

A wildling girl  a baby  

and Lord Janos. 

I found him there after 

the battle was over. 

In a puddle of his own making. 

Whilst Lord Janos was hiding 

with the women and children 

Jon Snow was leading. 

Ser Alliser fought bravely  it is true  

but when he was wounded  

it was Jon who saved us. 

He took charge of the Wall s defense  

he killed the Magnar of the Thenns  

he went North to deal with Mance Rayder. 

Knowing it would almost certainly mean 

his own death. 

Before that  

he led the mission to avenge 

Lord Commander Mormont. 

Mormont himself chose 

Jon to be his steward. 

He saw something in Jon. 

And now we ve all seen it too. 

He may be young  

but he s the commander we turned to 

when the night was darkest. 

Yeah  

Aye. 

Can t argue with any of that. 

But who does Jon Snow want to command  

The Night s Watch  

Or the wildlings  

Everyone knows he loved 

a wildling girl. 

He spoke with Mance Rayder many times. 

What would have happened in that tent 

between those two old friends 

if Stannis s army hadn t come along  

We all saw him put the King Beyond the Wall 

out of his misery. 

Do you want to choose a man who has fought 

the wildlings all his life 

or a man who makes love to them  

It is time  

Appears to be a tie  maester. 

Jon Snow  Jon Snow  

Jon Snow  Jon Snow  

Jon Snow  Jon Snow  

You  You  

What have you got there  

  I said... 

  Turn around and go  

Turn around... 

  and go  

  That s a nice little sword. 

Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that. 

Nothing s worth anything to dead men. 

Quickly  go  Go  

Who are you  

Why were they scared of you  

You lost this. 

You said there was no Jaqen H ghar here. 

There isn t. 

A man is not Jaqen H ghar. 

Who are you then  

No one. 

And that is who a girl must become. 

Why  

Mhysa  

Mhysa  

Mhysa  

Mhysa  Mhysa  

She should have cut the traitor s head 

in the Great Pyramid and be done with it. 

That s what I keep telling  

her to do to you. 

Mhysa  

Mhysa  

Mhysa  

l ll stand guard outside 

your door tonight  Your Grace. 

We all guard tonight. 

Leave me.

It s got to be the Mountain. 

He s the biggest. 

  He s the strongest. 

  Bulls are bigger than lions. 

Doesn t mean I d pick 

a bull in a fight. 

If the bull had fangs 

and claws  I would. 

Right  the Mountain 

or our man Jaime. 

If he ever gets out. 

Loras Tyrell  

Loras Tyrell. 

He s prettier than the queen. 

I don t care about pretty. 

He s better with a sword 

than any of them. 

How good could he be  

He s been stabbing 

Renly Baratheon for years  

and Renly ain t dead. 

The horses seem 

a little spooked to you  

They re horses. 

They get spooked 

by their own shadows. 

Shh. 

Do you hear that  

No. 

There s something 

out there. 

Oh. 

Oh  you re a right 

little prick. 

You should see 

your face. 

I swear you 

pissed yourself. 

 Oh  who goes there  

Ahh   

There is something out there. 

Yeah  don t even try me. 

  Rennick. 

  Do you think I m an idiot  

Rennick  

 i   King in the North   i  

 i   The King in the North   i  

 i Five Lannisters dead  i  

 i for every one of ours.  i  

They re dead. 

Take everything they ve got. 

 i We ve nowhere to keep  i  

 i all these prisoners.  i  

Barely enough food 

to feed our own. 

We re not executing 

prisoners  Lord Bolton. 

Of course  Your Grace. 

The officers 

will be useful. 

Some of them may be privy 

to Tywin Lannister s plans. 

I doubt it. 

 i Well  we ll learn  i  

 i soon enough.  i  

In my family we say  

 A naked man has few secrets. 

A flayed man none.  

My father outlawed 

flaying in the North. 

  We re not in the North. 

  We re not torturing them. 

The high road s very pretty  

but you ll have a hard time 

marching your army down it. 

The Lannisters hold 

prisoners of their own. 

I won t give them an excuse 

to abuse my sisters. 

 i No  no  don t  Don t   i  

 i   Shh  shh.  i  

 i   Please   i  

Shh. 

The rot s set in. 

No  don t  

No  don t  

  Shh. 

  Please  don t  

It ll get better. 

It doesn t even hurt. 

The rot will spread. 

If we don t take the foot now   

No  you can t  

Ser  Please  Ser. 

  I can t lose   

  You ll die if she does it. 

I don t want to be 

a cripple  please. 

Surely one of our men needs your 

attention more than this cub. 

Your men are not 

my men  My Lord. 

Put this in your mouth and lie down. 

You don t want to watch. 

  No  You can t  

  Bite on it. 

It s better than biting 

your own tongue  believe me. 

  What s your name  

  Talisa. 

 i Your last name   i  

You want to know what side 

my family fights on  

You know my family name. 

You have me at a disadvantage. 

That boy lost his foot 

on your orders. 

They killed my father. 

  That boy did  

  The family he fights for. 

Do you think he s friends 

with King Joffrey  

 i He s a fisherman s son  i  

 i that grew up near Lannisport.  i  

He probably never held a spear 

before they shoved one in his 

hands a few months ago. 

I have no hatred 

for the lad. 

That should help 

his foot grow back. 

You d have us surrender  

end all this bloodshed. 

I understand. 

The country would be at peace 

and life would be just 

under the righteous hand 

of good King Joffrey. 

  You re going to kill Joffrey  

  If the Gods give me strength. 

  And then what  

  I don t know. 

We ll go back 

to Winterfell. 

I have no desire to sit 

on the Iron Throne. 

So who will  

I don t know. 

You re fighting 

to overthrow a king  

and yet you have no plan 

for what comes after  

First we have 

to win the war. 

You never told me 

where you re from. 

  Volantis. 

  Volantis  

You re far from home. 

The boy was lucky 

you were here. 

He was unlucky 

that you were. 

You re here to answer for your 

brother s latest treasons. 

Your Grace  

whatever my traitor brother 

has done  I had no part. 

You know that. 

I beg you   

Ser Lancel  tell her 

of this outrage. 

 i Using some vile sorcery   i  

your brother fell on Stafford Lannister 

with an army of wolves. 

Thousands of good men 

were butchered. 

After the slaughter  

the northmen feasted on 

the flesh of the slain. 

Killing you would send 

your brother a message. 

But my mother insists 

on keeping you alive. 

Stand. 

So we ll have to send 

your brother 

a message some other way. 

Meryn. 

Leave her face. 

I like her pretty. 

Meryn  My Lady 

is overdressed. 

Unburden her. 

If you want Robb Stark 

to hear us  

we re going to have 

to speak louder. 

 i What is the meaning  i  

 i of this   i  

What kind of knight 

beats a helpless girl  

The kind who serves 

his king  Imp. 

Careful  now. We don t want 

to get blood all over your 

pretty white cloak. 

Someone get the girl something 

to cover herself with. 

She is to be your queen. 

Have you no regard 

for her honor  

 i   I m punishing her.  i  

 i   For what crimes   i  

 i She did not fight her  i  

 i brother s battle  you half wit.  i  

You can t talk to me like that. 

The king can do as he likes  

The Mad King 

did as he liked. 

Has your Uncle Jaime ever told 

you what happened to him  

No one threatens His Grace 

in the presence of the Kingsguard. 

I m not threatening 

the King  Ser. 

I am educating my nephew. 

Bronn  the next time 

Ser Meryn speaks  kill him. 

That was a threat. 

See the difference  

 i I apologize for  i  

 i my nephew s behavior.  i  

Tell me the truth. 

Do you want an end 

to this engagement  

I am loyal to King Joffrey  

my one true love. 

Lady Stark  you may 

survive us yet. 

The little king s 

backed up. 

Clogged from balls 

to brains. 

You think dipping his wick 

will cure what ails him  

There s no cure 

for being a cunt. 

But the boy s at that age. 

And he s got nothing to do all 

day but pick wings off flies. 

Couldn t hurt to get 

some of the poison out. 

What are you 

doing here  dog  

Your uncle left 

your nameday present 

and asked me to see 

that you got it. 

And  

What is it  

Look inside  

Your Grace. 

Your Grace. 

  Happy nameday  Your Grace. 

  My nameday has passed. 

We won t tell 

if you won t. 

No. 

Her. 

Touch her. 

Could you hit her  

My uncle sent you  

Yes  Your Grace. 

He chose us himself. 

Hmm. 

Use this. 

Harder. 

I said harder. 

He d want me to get 

his money s worth. 

Your Grace  too much pain 

will spoil the pleasure. 

 i Please  please   i  

please  Your Grace. 

Your Grace  

if your uncle finds out   

Oh  I want him 

to find out. 

You will bring her to his 

chambers when you re finished 

and show him 

what you ve done. 

Or the same thing 

will happen to you. 

Begin. 

Harder  

Well  if it isn t 

my favorite whoremonger. 

Pray I haven t kept 

you waiting long. 

Your Grace. 

Now you do the Lannisters  

bidding  is that it  

Tell me  was my brother s 

body even cold 

before you secured 

your newest patron  

I m a practical man. 

Just not a loyal one. 

 i And who would you have  i  

 i me be loyal to   i  

Your brother s corpse  

I don t like you  

Lord Baelish. 

I don t like your face. 

I don t like the words that come 

oozing out of your mouth. 

I don t want you in my tent 

one minute more than necessary. 

So tell me  

why are you here  

 i You can trust Brienne.  i  

Her loyalty comes 

without charge. 

You still have many friends 

at court  Your Grace  

many who believe 

Ned Stark erred 

by not supporting 

your claim. 

Now I understand. 

You know I have 

the numbers. 

You know I m marching 

on King s Landing. 

When I take the throne  

you hope to retain your position. 

And your head. 

I would give priority 

to my head. 

 i I understand that  i  

 i you don t like me   i  

and while that 

saddens me greatly  

I did not come here today 

seeking your affection. 

 i When you march  i  

 i on King s Landing   i  

you may find yourself facing 

a protracted siege or... 

open gates. 

Your Grace. 

Lord Baelish. 

All of these tents 

look the same to me. 

  Would you be so kind   

  It would be my pleasure. 

It took me weeks to learn 

way around the camp. 

Twice I walked in on officers 

in stages of undress. 

And the moment I learn 

which tent is mine  

we re on the move again. 

Your tent  

Not our tent  

The King snores  perhaps  

Or simply prefers 

solitude  

Pressures of command  

no doubt. 

Four kings vying 

for the throne. 

I am not tutored 

in warfare  

but basic arithmetic favors the 

side with the greater numbers. 

If war were arithmetic  

the mathematicians 

would rule the world. 

But I did notice your brother 

entering His Grace s tent the just now. 

The place of a Kingsguard 

is by the King s side. 

And on the night 

of the your wedding  

who was by 

the King s side then  

You seem quite interested 

in our marriage. 

Your marriage 

is quite interesting... 

Not only to me  

but to the realm. 

The marriage of a wealthy girl 

always breeds interest  

if nothing else. 

You ve never married  

have you  

I ve been unlucky 

in my affections  sadly. 

That is sad. 

Though perhaps 

it s for the best. 

The whole notion of marriage 

seems to confuse you  

so allow me to explain. 

My husband is my King  

and my King is my husband. 

Here is your tent  

Lord Baelish. Good night. 

What do you know 

of this place  

Only that the desert 

around their walls 

is called 

the Garden of Bones. 

Every time the Qartheen 

shut their gates on a traveler  

the garden grows. 

  Go on  

  You  keep moving  

 i Bring her about   i  

What kind of fire 

melts stone  

Dragon fire. 

There s dragons here  

No  all the dragons 

are dead. 

What s that smell  

Dead people. 

Move. 

 i Please  please  no  no   i  

 i No.  i  

 i He s dead.  i  

He was my son. 

My sister 

was three days ago. 

My husband  

the day before that. 

They take someone 

every day  

Does anyone live  

Joffrey. 

Cersei. 

Ilyn Payne. 

The Hound. 

Joffrey. 

Cersei. 

Ilyn Payne. 

The Hound. 

Joffrey. Cersei. 

Ilyn Payne. 

The Hound. 

How dare you  

You may have heard 

false reports. 

  You betrayed Ned. 

   i Betrayed   i  

I wanted him to serve 

as Protector of the Realm. 

I begged him 

to seize the moment. 

I trusted you. 

My husband trusted you. 

And you repaid our faith 

with treachery. 

  No  My Lady. 

  Get out  

Cat  I ve   

I ve loved you 

since I was a boy. 

It seems to me that fate 

has given us this chance   

Have you lost your mind  

Get out  

Do you want to see 

your girls again  

Sansa  more beautiful 

than ever. 

And Arya  

just as wild as ever. 

You have Arya  too  

Both girls are healthy 

and safe... 

 i for now.  i  

But you know the Queen 

and you know Joffrey. 

I fear for 

their longevity 

if they remain 

in the capital. 

What do you want  

The Lannisters will trade your 

daughters for the Kingslayer. 

Of course they will. 

Jaime Lannister 

for two girls  

Robb will never agree 

to those terms. 

I m not bringing 

these terms to him. 

I m bringing them 

to you. 

You think I d keep 

secrets from my son  

Robb has surprised them all 

with his skills in battle  

but he s not a mother. 

 i Consider it  Cat.  i  

 i You may not get  i  

 i another chance.  i  

  I ve brought you a gift. 

  I don t want your gifts. 

A token of Tyrion 

Lannister s goodwill. 

He wants you to understand 

that this exchange of prisoners 

is offered in good faith. 

Good faith  

What s this  

Your husband was 

an honorable man. 

He should rest beside his family 

in the crypts beneath Winterfell. 

  You may not believe   

  Get out. 

 i Get up  you dogs   i  

That s him  

the one who picks. 

The Mountain. 

What are you doing  

He told me he stares 

at him every day. 

That s why he 

doesn t get picked. 

You. 

 i Move  boy   i  

Move  

 i Is there gold and silver  i  

 i in the village   i  

  I don t know. 

   i Gems   i  

I didn t see any. 

  Where is the Brotherhood  

  I don t know. 

 i   Where is the Brotherhood   i  

  I don t know. Please. 

  Where is the Brotherhood  

  I don t know. 

Which of the villagers 

aided them  

  I don t know. 

  Who  

I   

  Who  

  I never saw. 

  Who  

  I never saw. 

Please. Please  stop. 

Please  it s starting to   

   i Who   i  

  I didn t see anyone help him. 

Take it off  Take it off  

   i Who helped him   i  

  Ganes the butcher 

  and his son. 

  That s better. 

   i You ve been very helpful.  i  

  No  stop  please  

 i What are you doing   i  

 i Please  stop   i  

 i Please  stop   i  

 i No  No   i  

I told you everything  

No  

No  

Joffrey. 

Cersei. 

Ilyn Payne. 

The Hound. 

 i Please  Polliver.  i  

 i Some food.  i  

Just a crust of bread. 

Polliver. 

The Mountain. 

Lady Stark  I had not thought 

to find you in the Stormlands. 

I had not thought 

to be here  Lord Stannis. 

  Can that truly be you  

  Who else might it be  

When I saw your standard  

I couldn t be sure. 

  Whose banner is that  

  My own. 

I suppose if we used 

the same one  

the battle would be 

terribly confusing. 

 i Why is your stag  i  

 i on fire   i  

The King has taken 

for his sigil 

the fiery heart 

of the Lord of Light. 

Ah  you must be this fire 

priestess we hear so much about. 

 i Mm  brother   i  

now I understand why you 

found religion in your old age. 

Watch yourself  Renly. 

 i No  no  I m relieved.  i  

I never really believed 

you re a fanatic. 

Charmless  rigid  

a bore  yes  

but not a godly man. 

You should kneel 

he s the Lord s chosen  

 i born amidst salt  i  

 i and smoke.  i  

Born amidst salt 

and smoke  

Is he a ham  

 i That s twice  i  

 i I ve warned you.  i  

Listen to yourselves. 

If you were sons of mine  I 

would knock your heads together 

and lock you in a bedchamber 

until you remembered 

that you were brothers. 

It is strange to find you 

beside my brother  Lady Stark. 

 i Your husband was a supporter  i  

 i of my claim.  i  

Lord Eddard s integrity 

cost him his head. 

And you sit beside this pretender 

and chastise me. 

We share a common enemy. 

The Iron Throne 

is mine by right. 

All those that deny that 

are my foes. 

The whole realm denies it  

from Dorne to the Wall. 

Old men deny it 

with their death rattle 

and unborn children deny it 

in their mother s wombs. 

No one wants you 

for their King. 

 i You never wanted  i  

 i any friends  brother.  i  

 i But a man without friends  i  

 i is a man without power.  i  

For the sake of the mother 

who bore us  

I will give you this one night 

to reconsider. 

Strike your banners  

come to me before dawn  

and I will grant you 

your old seat in the council. 

I ll even name you 

my heir 

until a son 

is born to me. 

Otherwise I shall 

destroy you. 

Look across 

those fields  brother. 

 i Can you see  i  

 i all those banners   i  

You think a few bolts 

of cloth will make you King  

No. 

The men holding those bolts 

of cloth will make me King. 

We shall see  Renly. 

Come the dawn  

we shall see. 

Look to your sins  

Lord Renly. 

The night is dark 

and full of terrors. 

Would you believe 

I loved him once  

I thought we were welcome. 

If you heard a Dothraki horde 

was approaching your city  

you might do the same  

Khaleesi. 

Horde  

My name is Daenerys   

Daenerys Stormborn 

of the House Targaryen. 

You know me  My Lord  

Only by reputation  

Khaleesi. 

And I m no lord  

merely a humble merchant. 

They call you 

the Mother of Dragons. 

And what should 

I call you  

Oh  my name is quite long 

and quite impossible 

for foreigners to pronounce. 

I am simply a trader 

of spices. 

But we are the Thirteen  

charged with the governance 

and protection of Qarth  

the greatest city 

that ever was or will be. 

The beauty of 

Quarth is legendary   

Qarth. 

Qarth. 

Might we see 

the dragons  

My friend  

we have travelled 

very far. 

 i We have no food   i  

 i no water.  i  

Once I see my people fed  

I would be honored   

Forgive me  

Mother of Dragons  

but no man alive has seen 

a living dragon. 

Some of my more 

skeptical friends 

refuse to believe 

your children 

even exist. 

 i All we ask is the chance  i  

 i to see for ourselves.  i  

I am not a liar. 

Oh  I don t think you are. 

But as I ve never 

met you before  

my opinion on the matter 

is of limited value. 

Where I come from  

guests are treated 

with respect  

not insulted 

at the gates. 

Then perhaps you should 

return to where you come from. 

We wish you well. 

What are you doing  

You promised 

to receive me. 

We have received you. 

Here we are  

and here you are. 

If you do not let us in  

all of us will die. 

Which we shall 

deeply regret. 

But Qarth did not become 

the greatest city that 

ever was or will be 

by letting Dothraki savages 

through its gates. 

Khaleesi  please 

be careful. 

Thirteen  

When my dragons are grown  

we will take back 

what was stolen from me 

and destroy those 

who have wronged me. 

We will lay waste 

to armies 

and burn cities 

to the ground. 

Turn us away and we will 

burn you first. 

Ah. 

You are a true 

Targaryen. 

Only  as you said 

a moment ago  

if we don t let you 

into the city  

you will all die. 

And so... 

Retreating in fear 

from a little girl 

is unbecoming 

of the greatest city 

that ever was 

or will be. 

The discussion is over  

Xaro Xhoan Daxos. 

The Thirteen have spoken. 

I am one of the Thirteen 

and I am still speaking. 

The girl threatens to burn 

our city to the ground 

and you would invite her in 

for a cup of wine  

She is the Mother 

of Dragons. 

Do you expect her to watch 

her people starve 

without breathing fire  

 i I believe we can allow  i  

 i a few Dothraki  i  

 i through our gates  i  

 i without dooming our city.  i  

 i After all  here I am   i  

a savage from 

the Summer Isles  

and Qarth still stands. 

Our decision is final. 

Very well. 

I invoke  i Soumai.  i  

 i I will vouch for her   i  

 i her people   i  

 i and her dragons  i  

 i in accordance with the law.  i  

Be it on your head. 

Welcome to Qarth  

My Lady. 

 i You.  i  

Is there gold or silver 

in the village  

  I m not from the village. 

  Where is the Brotherhood  

I don t know 

what that is. 

 i You two  take Lord Lannister s  i  

 i things to his quarters.  i  

What s this  

We weren t expecting you 

till tomorrow  Lord Tywin. 

Evidently not. 

Why are these prisoners 

not in their cells  

 i Cells are overflowing   i  

 i My Lord.  i  

 i This lot won t be here long.  i  

 i Don t need  i  

 i no permanent place.  i  

After we interrogate  em  

we usually just... 

Are we so well manned 

that we can afford to discard 

able young bodies 

and skilled laborers  

You  

do you have a trade  

 i Smith  My Lord.  i  

What are you looking at  

Kneel  

Kneel or I ll carve 

your lungs out  boy. 

He ll do no such thing. 

This one s a girl  

you idiot  

dressed as a boy. 

  Why  

  Safer to travel  My Lord. 

Smart. 

More than I can say 

for this lot. 

Get these prisoners 

to work. 

Bring the girl. 

I need a new 

cupbearer. 

 i My Lord.  i  

Your visits 

are too few  cousin. 

Her Grace  

the Queen Regent  

commands you to release 

Grand Maester Pycelle. 

  Here s your warrant. 

  So it is. 

Will you take 

a cup with me  

I find that mulled wine 

helps me sleep. 

 i I am here  i  

 i at Her Grace s behest   i  

not to drink 

with you  Imp. 

If my sister was 

so concerned for Pycelle  

 i I would have thought  i  

 i she d come herself.  i  

Instead she sends you. 

What am I to make 

of that  

 i I don t care  i  

 i what you make of it   i  

so long as you release 

your prisoner immediately. 

And you ve received these 

instructions directly from Cersei  

As I said several times. 

And you ve waited this long 

to deliver the information  

When the Queen Regent 

gives me a command  I carry 

it out without delay. 

Cersei must have 

great trust in you  

 i allowing you  i  

 i into her chamber  i  

during the hour 

of the wolf. 

The Queen Regent has a great 

many responsibilities. 

She often works 

from dusk till dawn. 

She must be very glad 

to have you helping her 

from dusk till dawn. 

Ah  lavender oil. 

She always loved lavender oil  

even as a girl. 

I am a knight  

An anointed knight  yes. 

Tell me  did Cersei 

have you knighted 

before or after she took 

you into her bed  

What  

Nothing to say  

No more warnings 

for me  Ser  

You will withdraw 

these filthy accusations. 

Have you ever given 

any thought 

to what King Joffrey 

will have to say 

when he finds out you ve 

been bedding his mother  

It s not my fault  

Did she take you 

against your will  

Can you not defend 

yourself  knight  

Your own father  Lord Tywin  

when I was named the King s squire  

he told me to obey her 

in everything. 

Did he tell you 

to fuck her  too  

I only meant 

I did as I was bid. 

Hated every 

moment of it  

is that what you ll 

have me believe  

A high place in court  

a knighthood  

my sister s legs spreading 

open for you at night. 

Oh  yes  it must 

have been terrible. 

Wait here. His Grace will want 

to hear this. 

Mercy  

Mercy  My Lord  I beg you. 

Save it for Joffrey. 

He loves a good grovel. 

My Lord  it was 

your sister s bidding   

the Queen. 

I ll leave the city 

at once  I swear. 

  No  I think not. 

  My Lord  

You heard me. 

My father told you 

to obey my sister. 

Obey her. 

Stay close to her side. 

Keep her trust. 

Pleasure her 

whenever she requires. 

No one ever need know 

as long as you keep 

faith with me. 

I want to know 

what Cersei is doing  

where she goes  

who she sees  

what they talk of   

everything. 

And you will tell me. 

Yes  My Lord  I will. 

I swear it  

as you command. 

Oh  rise  rise. 

Let us drink to 

our understanding. 

Oh  you don t have 

a cup. Oh  well. 

Smile  cousin. My sister 

is a beautiful woman. 

And it s all for 

the good of the realm. 

Go back and tell her 

that I beg her forgiveness  

that I want no more 

conflict between us 

and that henceforth 

I shall do nothing 

without her consent. 

But her demands. 

Oh  I ll give her Pycelle. 

  You will  

  Yes  I ll release him in the morning. 

 i Cersei can keep him  i  

 i as a pet if she wants   i  

 i but I will not have him  i  

 i on the council.  i  

I could swear that I had not 

harmed a single hair on his head  

but that would not  

strictly speaking  be true. 

 i Stay within  i  

 i one table length.  i  

Your Grace. 

Do your knucklebones 

bring you luck  

Well  life s been good since you 

hacked them off  Your Grace. 

And it s four less 

fingernails to clean. 

  Fewer. 

  Pardon  

Four fewer 

fingernails to clean. 

Never understood 

why you had to wear them. 

It reminds me of where I 

come from and where I am now. 

It reminds me 

of your justice. 

It was an honest 

punishment 

and you were good 

with the cleaver. 

You were a hero 

and a smuggler. 

A good act does not 

wash out the bad  

nor a bad the good. 

A lesson I ve tried 

to teach my son. 

  Does he listen  

  To me  

Gods  no. 

But if your red woman told him 

to leap from the crow s nest   

She has a name. 

I trust you ve not forgotten 

your smuggler s tricks. 

I ve lived within 

the law for    

I want you to be 

a smuggler this time. 

Any shore  any night. 

What am I bringing 

ashore  

The red woman. 

No one must know 

what you do 

and we ll not speak 

of this again. 

I am true to Your Grace 

and always will be  

but surely there are 

other ways  cleaner ways. 

Cleaner ways 

don t win wars. 

Are you afraid  

Onion Knight  

Someone once told me 

the night is dark and 

full of terrors. 

You ve carried more 

unpleasant cargo in your time. 

Are you a good man  

Ser Davos Seaworth  

I d say my parts 

are mixed  My Lady   

good and bad. 

If half an onion 

is black with rot  

it s a rotten onion. 

A man is good 

or he is evil. 

  And which are you  

   i Oh  good.  i  

I m a knight myself 

of sorts  

a champion of light 

and life. 

Well  that must be 

very nice for you. 

  Do you love your wife  

  I do. 

Yet you have known 

other women. 

Don t talk about my wife. 

I m not. I m talking about 

other women. 

Like me  Ser Davos. 

You want me. 

You want to see 

what s beneath this robe. 

And you will. 

Strange that 

this Lord of Light 

asks you to work 

in the shadows. 

Shadows cannot live 

in the dark  Ser Davos. 

They are servants 

of light  

the children of fire. 

And the brighter the flame  

the darker they are. 

These weren t here before. 

They ve barred the passage. 

They can t bar 

our passage. 

Gods protect us. 

There s only one God  

Ser Davos  

and he only protects 

those who serve him. 

Despite appearances  I think you ll 

find the city s on the rise. 

Perhaps we should take shelter. 

The city s on the rise  

Meereen is strong. 

Commerce has returned to the markets. 

The people are behind you. 

Well  not all the people  of course. 

No ruler that ever lived had 

the support of all the people. 

But the rebirth of Meereen is 

the cause of this violence. 

The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. 

Because if Meereen succeeds  

a city without slavery  

a city without Masters... 

...it proves that no one needs a Master. 

Good. 

Shall we begin  

Do we have a plan  

I will crucify the Masters. 

I will set their fleets afire  

kill every last one of their soldiers  

and return their cities to the dirt. 

That is my plan. 

You don t approve  

You once told me you knew 

what your father was. 

Did you know his plans 

for King s Landing 

when the Lannister armies 

were at his gates  

Probably not. 

Well  he told my brother 

and Jaime told me. 

He had caches of wildfire 

hidden under the Red Keep  

the Guildhalls  the Sept of Baelor  

all the major thoroughfares. 

He would have burned every 

one of his citizens. 

The loyal ones and the traitors. 

Every man  woman  and child. 

That s why Jaime killed him. 

This is entirely different. 

You re talking about destroying cities. 

It s not entirely different. 

I d like to suggest an 

alternate approach. 

Once before  I offered you peace. 

If you had not been so arrogant  

you could have returned to your 

homeland with a fleet of ships. 

Instead  you will flee 

Slaver s Bay on foot 

like the beggar queen you are. 

We are here to discuss 

terms of surrender  

not to trade insults. 

The terms are simple. 

You and your foreign friends will abandon 

the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. 

The Unsullied you stole 

from Kraznys mo Nakloz 

will remain to be sold again 

to the highest bidder. 

The translator you stole from 

Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain 

to be sold again to the highest bidder. 

The dragons beneath the Great 

Pyramid will be slaughtered. 

We obviously didn t communicate clearly. 

We re here to discuss 

your surrender  not mine. 

I imagine it s difficult 

adjusting to the new reality. 

Your reign is over. 

My reign has just begun. 

Dracarys. 

Your men have a choice  

fight and die for masters who would 

never fight and die for you  

or go home to your families. 

Thank you for the armada. 

Our queen does love ships. 

Now  last time we spoke  we made a pact. 

You violated that pact. 

You declared war upon us. 

Though our queen does 

have a forgiving nature  

this cannot be forgiven. 

Our queen insists that 

one of you must die 

as punishment for your crimes. 

It always seems a bit 

abstract  doesn t it  

other people dying  

Him. He should die. 

Yes  him. He s not one of us. 

He s an outsider  a lowborn. 

He does not speak for us. 

Please. 

Please. 

Tell your people what happened here. 

Tell them you live by the 

grace of Her Majesty. 

When they come forward with 

notions of retribution 

or ideas about returning the slave 

cities to their former glory  

remind them what happened 

when Daenerys Stormborn and 

her dragons came to Meereen. 

You don t have to be here. 

Yes  I do. 

My beloved wife. 

I ve missed you terribly. 

Thank you for returning 

Lady Bolton safely. 

Now  dismount and kneel before me  

surrender your army and proclaim me the true 

Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. 

I will pardon you for 

deserting the Night s Watch. 

I will pardon these treasonous 

lords for betraying my house. 

Come  bastard  

you don t have the men  you 

don t have the horses  

and you don t have Winterfell. 

Why lead those poor 

souls into slaughter  

There s no need for a battle. 

Get off your horse and kneel. 

I m a man of mercy. 

You re right. 

There s no need for a battle. 

Thousands of men don t need to die. 

Only one of us. 

Let s end this the old way. 

You against me. 

I keep hearing stories 

about you  bastard. 

The way people in the 

North talk about you  

you re the greatest 

swordsman who ever walked. 

Maybe you are that good. 

Maybe not. 

I don t know if I d beat you. 

But I know that my army will beat yours. 

I have   men. 

You have  what  half that  

Not even  

Aye  you have the numbers. 

Will your men want to fight for you 

when they hear you 

wouldn t fight for them  

He s good. Very good. 

Tell me  will you let 

your little brother die 

because you re too proud to surrender  

How do we know you have him  

Now  if you want to save... 

You re going to die 

tomorrow  Lord Bolton. 

Sleep well. 

She s a fine woman  your sister. 

I look forward to having 

her back in my bed. 

And you re all fine looking men. 

My dogs are desperate to meet you. 

I haven t fed them for 

seven days. They re ravenous. 

I wonder which parts they ll try first. 

Your eyes  

Your balls  

We ll find out soon enough. 

In the morning  then  bastard. 

If he was smart  he d stay inside 

the walls of Winterfell and wait us out. 

That s not his way. He knows 

the North is watching. 

If the other houses sense 

weakness on his part  

they ll stop fearing him. 

He can t have that. Fear is his power. 

It s his weakness  too. His men 

don t want to fight for him. 

They re forced to fight for him. 

If they feel the tide turning... 

It s not his men that worry me. 

It s his horses. 

I know what mounted 

knights can do to us. 

You and Stannis cut through 

us like piss through snow. 

We re digging trenches 

all along our flanks. 

They won t be able to hit us 

the way that Stannis hit you  

in a double envelopment. 

A pincer move. 

They won t be able to 

hit us from the sides. 

Good. 

It s crucial that we 

let them charge at us. 

They ve got the numbers  

we need the patience. 

If we let him buckle our 

center  he ll pursue. 

Then we ll have him 

surrounded on three sides. 

Did you really think that cunt 

would fight you man to man  

No. 

But I wanted to make him angry. 

I want him coming at us full tilt. 

We should all get some sleep. 

Rest  Jon Snow. We need 

you sharp tomorrow. 

So you ve met the enemy  

drawn up your battle plans. 

Aye  for what they re worth. 

You ve known him for the space 

of a single conversation  

you and your trusted advisors  

and you sit around making your plans 

on how to defeat a man you don t know. 

I lived with him. 

I know the way his mind works. 

I know how he likes to hurt people. 

Did it ever once occur to you 

that I might have some insight  

You re right. 

You think he s going to 

fall into your trap. 

He won t. He s the one who lays traps. 

  He s overconfident. 

  He plays with people. 

He s far better at it than you. 

He s been doing it all his life. 

Aye  and what have I been doing all 

my life  Playing with broomsticks  

I fought beyond the Wall against 

worse than Ramsay Bolton. 

I ve defended the Wall from 

worse than Ramsay Bolton. 

You don t know him. 

All right  tell me. 

What should we do  How 

do we get Rickon back  

We ll never get him back. 

Rickon is Ned Stark s trueborn son  

which makes him a greater 

threat to Ramsay 

than you  a bastard  or me  a girl. 

As long as he lives  Ramsay s claim 

to Winterfell will be contested  

which means he won t live long. 

We can t give up on our brother. 

Listen to me  please. He 

wants you to make a mistake. 

Of course he does. What 

should I do differently  

I don t know  I don t know 

anything about battles. 

Just don t do what he wants you to do. 

Aye  that s good advice. 

You think that s obvious  

Well  it is a bit obvious. 

If you had asked for my advice earlier  

I would have told you not 

to attack Winterfell 

until we had a larger force  

or is that obvious  too  

When will we have a larger force   

We ve pleaded with every 

house that ll have us. 

The Blackfish can t help us. 

We re lucky to have this many men. 

  It s not enough    No  it s 

not enough. It s what we have  

Battles have been won 

against greater odds. 

If Ramsay wins  

I m not going back there alive. 

Do you understand me  

I won t let ever let 

him touch you again. 

I ll protect you  I promise. 

No one can protect me. 

No one can protect anyone. 

You think there s hope  

I ve never seen these 

Bolton fuckers fight. 

And they ve never seen 

the free folk fight  

so  yes  there s hope. 

You want to avenge your king  don t you  

It wasn t the Boltons defeated Stannis. 

It was Stannis himself. 

I loved the man. 

He lifted me up and made me something. 

But he had demons in his skull 

whispering foul things. 

  You saw these demons  

  What  

No  it s a manner of speaking. 

Not... actual demons. 

Well  you loved that cunt Stannis 

and I loved the man he burned. 

Mance didn t have demons in his skull. 

He didn t torch people or 

listen to some red witch. 

I believed in him. 

I thought he was the man to 

lead us through the Long Night. 

But I was wrong just like you. 

Maybe that was our mistake  

believing in kings. 

Jon Snow s not a king. 

No  he s not. 

I need a good drink to help me 

sleep the night before a fight. 

You want some  

I have a jug of sour goat s milk 

stronger than any of that grape water 

you southern twats like sucking on. 

No  thanks. It does sound delicious  

but I better keep a clear head. 

I can never sleep the 

night before a battle. 

So what do you do all night  

I walk. 

Think and walk. 

Think and walk until I m 

far enough away from camp 

that no one can hear me 

shitting my guts out. 

Happy shitting. 

My lady. 

You weren t at the war council. 

I m not a soldier. 

Any advice  

Don t lose. 

If I do  if I fall... 

don t bring me back. 

I ll have to try. 

I m ordering you not to bring me back. 

I am not your servant  Jon Snow. 

You re in my camp. I m the commander. 

I serve the Lord of Light. 

I do what he commands. 

How do you know what he commands  

I interpret his signs... 

as well as I can. 

If the Lord didn t want 

me to bring you back  

how did I bring you back  

I have no power. 

Only what he gives me 

and he gave me you. 

Why  

I don t know. 

Maybe you re only needed for this small 

part of his plan and nothing else. 

Maybe he brought you here to die again. 

What kind of god would 

do something like that  

The one we ve got. 

Game of Thrones    The Battle of Bastards. 

Last time we saw each other 

was at Winterfell  yes  

You were making jokes about 

my height  I seem to recall. 

Everyone who makes a joke 

about a dwarf s height 

thinks he s the only person ever to 

make a joke about a dwarf s height. 

 The height of nobility   

 a man of your stature   

 someone to look up to.  

You re all making the 

same five or six jokes. 

  It was a long time ago. 

  It was. 

And how have things been 

going for you since then  

Not so well  I gather. 

Can t imagine you would have murdered the 

Stark boys if things had been going well. 

I didn t murder the Stark boys. 

But I did things that were 

just as bad or worse. 

And he paid for them. 

Doesn t seem like it. 

He s still alive. 

It was complicated for you  I m sure  

growing up at Winterfell. 

Never quite knowing who you were. 

But then  we all live 

complicated lives  don t we  

You ve brought us  

ships from the Iron Fleet 

with men to sail them. 

In return  I expect you 

want me to support 

your claim to the throne 

of the Iron Islands  

Not my claim. Hers. 

And what s wrong with you  

I m not fit to rule. 

We can agree upon that at least. 

Has the Iron Islands 

ever had a queen before  

No more than Westeros. 

Our Uncle Euron returned 

home after a long absence. 

He murdered our father and took 

the Salt Throne from Yara. 

He would have murdered 

us if we d stayed. 

Lord Tyrion tells me your 

father was a terrible king. 

You and I have that in common. 

We do. 

And both murdered by a usurper as well. 

Will their ships be enough  

With the former Masters  

fleet  possibly. 

Barely. 

There are more than  

ships in the Iron Fleet. 

There are and Euron is building more. 

He s going to offer them to you. 

So why shouldn t I wait for him  

The Iron Fleet isn t all he s bringing. 

He also wants to give you... 

His big cock  I think he said. 

Euron s offer is also an 

offer of marriage  you see. 

You won t get one without the other. 

And I imagine your offer is 

free of any marriage demands  

I never demand  but I m 

up for anything  really. 

He murdered our father and 

would have murdered us. 

He ll murder you as soon 

as you have what he wants. 

The Seven Kingdoms. 

All of them. 

And you don t want the Seven Kingdoms  

Your ancestors defeated ours 

and took the Iron Islands. 

We ask you to give them back. 

And that s all  

We d like you to help us 

murder an uncle or two 

who don t think a woman s fit to rule. 

Reasonable. 

What if everyone starts 

demanding their independence  

She s not demanding  she s asking. 

The others are free to ask as well. 

Our fathers were evil 

men  all of us here. 

They left the world worse 

than they found it. 

We re not going to do that. 

We re going to leave the world 

better than we found it. 

You will support my claim as 

queen of the Seven Kingdoms 

and respect the integrity 

of the Seven Kingdoms. 

No more reaving  roving  

raiding  or raping. 

That s our way of life. 

No more. 

No more. 

Do you like games  little man  

Let s play a game. 

Run to your brother. 

The sooner you make it to him  

the sooner you get to see him again. 

That s it. 

That s the game. 

Easy. 

Ready  

Go. 

No  you have to run  remember  

Those are the rules.

We re going home  

Open the gate  

Archers to the wall. 

  Their army s gone. 

  Our army s gone. 

We have Winterfell. 

They don t have the men for a siege. 

All we have to do is wait. 

Archers  

To the wall  

You suggested one on one 

combat  didn t you  

I ve reconsidered. 

I think that sounds 

like a wonderful idea. 

We re going to bury my 

brother in the crypt 

next to my father. 

Jon. 

Where is he  

Sansa. 

Hello  Sansa. 

Is this where I ll be staying now  

No. 

Our time together is 

about to come to an end. 

That s all right. 

You can t kill me. 

I m part of you now. 

Your words will disappear. 

Your house will disappear. 

Your name will disappear. 

All memory of you will disappear. 

My hounds will never harm me. 

You haven t fed them in seven days. 

You said it yourself. 

They re loyal beasts. 

They were. 

Now they re starving. 

Sit. 

Down. 

Down  

Down  Down  

Down  

The Lord of Light has made good 

on his promise  my king. 

His fires have melted 

the snows away. 

The way ahead is clear. 

We ride for Winterfell. 

And you will take it. 

The Lord has shown me 

Bolton banners burning. 

You will receive 

what is yours by right. 

Your Grace. 

Prepare to form up. 

Your Grace. 

Tell me. 

The men  many deserted 

before dawn. 

 i How many   i  

 i Nearly half.  i  

All the sellswords 

with all the horses. 

Your Grace. 

Speak up. 

Can t be worse than mutiny. 

Cut her down. 

 i Your Grace.  i  

The Lady Melisandre 

was just seen riding out of camp. 

Get the men 

into marching formation. 

On to Winterfell. 

He raised his hands 

and they all stood up 

at once. 

Tens of thousands of them. 

The biggest army in the world. 

So what are you 

gonna do  

I m gonna hope they don t 

learn how to climb the Wall. 

But the dragonglass... 

No one s ever 

getting that back now. 

 i It wouldn t have  i  

 i mattered anyway.  i  

 i Not unless we had  i  

 i a mountain of it.  i  

But you killed 

a white walker. 

 i With Longclaw.  i  

I saw them shatter steel axes 

like they were glass. 

  But Longclaw... 

 i    Is Valyrian steel.  i  

How many Valyrian steel swords 

are left in the Seven Kingdoms  

Not enough. 

The first Lord Commander 

in history 

to sacrifice the lives 

of sworn brothers 

to save the lives 

of wildlings. 

How s it feel to be friends 

with the most hated man in Castle Black  

 i You were friends with me  i  

 i when I first came here.  i  

And I wasn t winning 

any elections back then. 

Here s to us  then. 

Long may they sneer. 

What  

I wanted to ask 

you something. 

To ask something of you. 

Send me  Gilly  

and the baby to Oldtown 

so I can become a maester. 

That s what I m meant to be. 

Not this. 

I need you here  Sam. 

If you leave  who s left 

to give me advice I trust  

Well  there s Edd. 

I d be more use 

to you as a maester. 

More use to everyone 

now that Maester Aemon is gone. 

The Citadel has the world s 

greatest library. 

I ll learn about history  

strategy  healing. 

And other things  

things that will 

help when   

when they come. 

If Gilly stays here  

then she ll die. 

And the baby that she named 

after me will die. 

And I ll end up dying  too  

trying to protect them. 

Which means that the last thing that 

I ll see in this world 

will be the look in her eyes 

when I fail them. 

And I d rather see 

a thousand white walkers than see that. 

Thank you. 

You know that the Citadel will make you 

swear off women  too. 

Oh  they ll bloody try. 

  Sam. 

  What  

Sam. 

You had just been 

beaten half to death. How did you   

Oh  very carefully. 

I m glad 

the end of the world s 

working out well 

for someone. 

I ll come back. 

To your return. 

To my return. 

 i Aye  this way.  i  

 i My lady   i  

Stannis. 

Stannis Baratheon is coming. 

His whole army. 

How do you know 

it s Stannis  

They re carrying his 

flaming heart banners. 

From the Blackwater. 

I ll never forget it. 

Trench here. 

Another one  yards 

from the castle wall. 

Hurry them along. 

  Right  Curlew. 

  Yes  sir. 

 i Dig between those two rises.  i  

  Spread out. 

 i    I m with you.  i  

 i   Archers   i  

 i   Spread out   i  

And send out 

a foraging party immediately. 

Siege begins 

at sunrise. 

There s not going 

to be a siege  Your Grace. 

 i We ve got no chance   i  

 i No  please  please.  i  

Bolton has women 

fighting for him  

I don t fight 

for the Boltons. 

I m Brienne of Tarth. 

I was Kingsguard 

to Renly Baratheon. 

I was there when he was 

murdered by a shadow with your face. 

 i You murdered him  i  

 i with blood magic   i  

I did. 

In the name of Renly 

of House Baratheon  

First of His Name  

rightful King of the Andals 

and the First Men  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms 

and Protector of the Realm  

I  Brienne of Tarth  

sentence you to die. 

Do you have 

any last words  

Go on  do your duty. 

Looks like we re done here. 

I surrender  

I surrender  

And I accept 

your surrender. 

Let s head back. 

My wife must be lonely. 

My lady. 

I ve come to escort you 

back to your chamber. 

Go with her  please. 

I know what Ramsay is. 

I know what 

he ll do to me. 

If I m going to die  

let it happen while there s 

still some of me left. 

Die  

Who said anything 

about dying  

You can t die. 

Your father was 

Warden of the North. 

Ramsay needs you. 

Though I suppose 

he doesn t need all of you. 

Just the parts he ll use 

to make his heir  

until you ve given him a boy or two 

and he s finished using them. 

Then he s got incredible 

plans for those parts. 

So  shall we wait 

for him to come back 

or should we begin now  

You re leaving it to me  

Good. 

Let s begin. 

Reek   stop  

Stop  

 i    Open the gate   i  

He s coming back. 

I can see I have 

my work cut out for me. 

You two  out. 

You were the first person 

on my list  you know. 

For killing Syrio Forel. 

Remember him  

Probably not. 

I ve gotten a few 

of the others. 

The Many Faced God stole 

a few more from me. 

But I m glad 

he left me you. 

Do you know who I am  

I can t hear you. 

You know who I am. 

I m Arya Stark. 

Do you know 

who you are  

You re no one. 

You re nothing. 

A girl has taken a life. 

The wrong life. 

I was right about her. 

You were. 

You re not ready. 

Not at all. 

That man s life 

was not yours to take. 

A girl stole from 

the Many Faced God. 

Now a debt is owed. 

Only death 

can pay for life. 

No  No  

No  you   don t die  

Don t die  

Why are you crying  

He was my friend. 

No  he wasn t. 

Didn t you listen to him  

 i He was no one.  i  

But if you re   

who s this  

 i No one at all.  i  

Just as a girl should have been 

before she took a face from the hall. 

 i The faces are for no one.  i  

You are still someone. 

And to someone  

the faces are as good 

as poison. 

I can t see. 

What s happening  

What s happening   

 i   I wish you a safe journey home.  i  

  Thank you. 

Forgive me  child. 

I wish you all the happiness 

in the world. 

Maybe I ll come 

visit you sometime. 

Maybe I ll come 

visit you. 

Don t wait too long. 

Got a noblewoman 

to marry back home. 

You want a good girl  

but you need 

the bad pussy. 

 i Whenever you re  i  

 i ready  my lord.  i  

Try not to lose it 

this time. 

I ll never 

take it off again. 

I know you didn t 

want to leave Dorne  

but I m glad 

you re coming home. 

Your mother s desperate 

to see you. 

I m glad Trystane 

is coming with us. 

He seems like a nice boy. 

You re lucky. 

Arranged marriages 

are rarely so   

so well arranged. 

Do you think Mother 

will like him  

If she sees you re happy  

I m sure she will. 

You really believe that  

Have you ever known 

your mother to like anyone 

aside from her children  

She likes you. 

I m not so sure 

about that. 

Listen... 

there s something 

I wanted to tell you. 

Something I should 

have told you long ago. 

So... 

now that you ve seen 

more of the world  

you ve learned how complicated 

things can be  

people can be. 

The Lannisters and the Martells have 

hated each other for years  

but you ve fallen 

in love with Trystane. 

It was an accident  really. 

I mean  what were the chances  

You happen to fall 

in love with the man 

you were assigned 

to marry  

My point is... 

we don t choose 

whom we love. 

It just  well   

it s beyond our control. 

  I sound like an idiot. 

  No  you don t. 

What I m trying to say   

what I m trying 

and failing to say   

I know what 

you re trying to say. 

No  I m afraid you don t. 

I do. 

I know. 

About you and Mother. 

I think a part of me 

always knew. 

And I m glad. 

I m glad 

that you re my father. 

Myrcella  

Myrcella  

Myrcella  

Myrcella  

You love her  

don t you  

How could you not  

Of course it s hopeless 

for the both of you. 

A sellsword from the fighting pits  

a disgraced knight. 

Neither one of you 

is fit consort for a queen. 

But we always want 

the wrong woman. 

Does he always 

talk so much  

Jorah the Andal. 

Torgo Nudho. 

He should not be here. 

No  but he is. 

Our queen ordered him 

exiled from city. 

Our queen would be dead 

if not for him. 

 i Pu  ila.  i  

Thank you. 

I am sorry. 

Sorry I not there 

to fight for our queen. 

You missed a good scrap. 

None of that matters now. 

The longer we sit 

here bantering  

the longer Daenerys is out there 

in the wilderness. 

He s right. 

The dragon headed north. 

If we re going to find her  

that s where we ll have to go. 

We  

You re a Lannister. 

The queen intends to remove 

your family from power. 

And I intend 

to help her do it. 

You ve been here 

for how many days now  

I ve fought 

for her for years. 

Since she was little 

more than a child. 

  You betrayed her. 

  Careful now. 

And she exiled you. 

Twice  I believe. 

The second time 

thanks to you. 

Don t blame me 

for your crimes  Mormont. 

He s right. 

Our queen exiled Jorah. 

And he s right. 

Jorah saved her life. 

Perhaps she feels 

differently about him now. 

Perhaps not. The only way 

we ll know is if we ask her. 

 i Fine  fine.  i  

 i I suppose he can join us.  i  

Just as long as he promises 

not to kill me in my sleep. 

If I ever kill you  

your eyes will be wide open. 

Forgive me  but why would 

we bring you  

Pardon me  

Have you ever tracked 

animals in the wilderness  

Not precisely  but I have other skills 

that would be useful. 

Can you fight  

I have fought. 

I don t claim to be 

a great warrior. 

Are you good 

on a horse  

Middling. 

So mainly you talk. 

And drink. 

I ve survived so far. 

Which I respect  but you would 

not help us on this expedition. 

You would help us 

here in Meereen  though. 

None of us have experience 

governing a city 

except for him. 

You want to prove 

your value to the queen  

Prove it right here 

in Meereen. 

He s a foreign dwarf 

that barely speaks the language. 

Why would the Meereenese 

listen to him  

They wouldn t. 

They will listen 

to Grey Worm. 

I ll come with you. 

I ll find our queen. 

  You are not strong enough to go anywhere. 

  I am. 

He is. He s the toughest man 

with no balls I ever met. 

But you still can t go. 

The people believe in you. 

They know you speak 

for the queen. 

It s true. 

Only the Unsullied can keep 

the peace in Meereen. 

If you leave  half this city will 

consume the other half. 

And Missandei. 

Our queen trusts no one 

more than Missandei. 

Certainly not me. 

The queen s 

closest confidante  

the commander 

of the Unsullied  

and a foreign dwarf 

with a scarred face. 

Good fortune  

my friends. 

Meereen is ancient 

and glorious. 

Try not to ruin her. 

Looks like it s you and me  

Jorah the Andal. 

Let s find 

some good horses. 

We have so much 

to talk about. 

Hello  old friend. 

I thought we were so happy together 

until you abandoned me. 

I suppose there s no point 

asking how you found me. 

The birds sing in the west  

the birds sing in the east  

if one knows 

how to listen. 

They tell me you ve 

already found favor 

with the Mother 

of Dragons. 

Well  she didn t 

execute me  

so that s 

a promising start. 

Now the heroes 

are off to find her 

and I m stuck here 

trying to placate a city 

on the brink of civil war. 

Any advice 

for an old comrade  

Information is the key. 

You need to learn 

your enemy s strengths and strategies. 

You need to learn which of your friends 

are not your friends. 

If only I knew someone 

with a vast network of spies. 

If only. 

A grand old city 

choking on violence  

corruption  and deceit. 

Who could possibly 

have any experience 

managing such a massive  

ungainly beast  

I did miss you. 

Oh  I know. 

We have to go home. 

Oh  my poor  

sweet thing. 

Does it hurt  

We have to go home. 

Drogon. 

Can you take me 

back to Meereen  

How far 

did you carry me  

Drogon  we need 

to return. 

My people need me. 

Well  there s no food. 

At the very least  

you could hunt us some supper. 

Confess. 

Confess. 

I have sinned. 

I see that now. 

How can I have been 

so blind for so long  

I want to be clean again. 

I want absolution. 

The Crone came to me 

with her lamp raised high. 

And by its holy light   

You wish to make 

a confession  

Once I ve confessed  

will I be free  

Your Grace will be 

dealt with according to her sins. 

The Mother have 

mercy  then. 

I lay with a man outside 

the bonds of marriage. I confess. 

Name him. 

Lancel Lannister. 

Your cousin 

and the king s squire. 

  I was lonely and afraid. 

  You had a husband. 

A husband off whoring 

every chance he   

His sins do not 

pardon your own. 

May the gods forgive me. 

Other men  

No. 

No others  

No. 

 i Speaking falsehoods  i  

 i before the gods is a great crime.  i  

 i You understand this   i  

I do. 

There are those 

that say your children 

were not fathered 

by King Robert  

that they are bastards 

born of incest and adultery. 

A lie. 

A lie from the lips 

of Stannis Baratheon. 

He wants the throne  but his brother s 

 children stand in his way. 

So he claims they are 

not his brother s. 

That filth. 

There is not one shred 

of truth to it. 

I deny it. 

Good. 

But these 

are terrible charges. 

And the realm must know 

the truth of them. 

If Your Grace has given 

honest testimony  

your trial will prove 

your innocence. 

Trial  

I have confessed. 

To a single sin. 

Others you have denied. 

Your trial will separate the truths 

from the falsehoods. 

I bow to the wisdom 

of Your High Holiness. 

But if I might beg 

for just one drop 

of the Mother s mercy. 

I haven t seen my son   

I don t know 

how long it s been. 

I need to see him  please. 

You have taken the first step on the path 

back to righteousness. 

In light of this  

I will permit you 

to return to the Red Keep. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

The Mother is merciful. 

It is her 

you should thank. 

I will. I will. 

I swear it  

day and night. 

Good. 

Am I free to go  

After your atonement. 

My atonement  

A sinner 

comes before you. 

Cersei of House Lannister. 

Mother to His Grace 

King Tommen. 

Widow of His Grace 

King Robert. 

She has committed 

the acts of falsehood 

and fornication. 

 i She has confessed  i  

 i her sins  i  

 i and begged  i  

 i for forgiveness.  i  

 i To demonstrate  i  

 i her repentance   i  

 i she will cast aside  i  

 i all pride  all artifice   i  

 i and present herself  i  

 i as the gods made her  i  

to you  

the good people 

of the city. 

She comes before you 

with a solemn heart  

shorn of secrets  

 i naked before the eyes  i  

 i of gods and men...  i  

to make her walk 

of atonement.

Your Grace. 

It s good 

to have you back. 

Come. 

We ll take you inside. 

I need to have a look 

at those feet. 

May I have the honor of presenting 

the newest member of the Kingsguard  

If it please Your Grace  

he has taken a holy vow of silence. 

He has sworn 

that he will not speak 

until all His Grace s 

enemies are dead 

and evil has been 

driven from the realm. 

Who came to your aid  

Stannis. 

Now he needs you. 

We don t have enough men 

to make any difference. 

The wildlings will make 

a difference. 

The wildlings will never 

fight for Stannis. 

  I told him before. 

  You saved their bloody lives. 

If they re gonna live 

in the Seven Kingdoms  

safe behind i  our  i  Wall  

they ought to fight for the damn place. 

  It s not their fight. 

 i    Open the gates   i  

Stannis  

Shireen  

The princess  

Lord Commander. 

 i It s one of the wildlings  i  

 i you brought back.  i  

 i Says he knows  i  

 i your Uncle Benjen.  i  

Says he s still alive. 

Are you sure 

he s talking about Benjen  

Said he was 

First Ranger. 

Said he knows 

where to find him. 

Man says he saw 

your uncle at Hardhome 

at the last full moon. 

  Could be lying. 

  Could be. 

There are ways 

to find out. 

  Where is he  

  Over there. 

For the Watch. 

For the Watch. 

For the Watch. 

For the Watch. 

For the Watch. 

Olly... 

For the Watch. 

Yes  

For you  my lady. 

How far is Mole s Town  

Sansa. 

Lady Brienne. 

When I heard you had escaped 

Winterfell  I feared the worst. 

You have no idea how happy I am 

to see you unharmed. 

Unharmed  

What are you doing here  

I rode north with the Knights 

of the Vale to come to your aid. 

They re encamped at 

Moat Cailin as we speak. 

To come to my aid  

Did you know about Ramsay  

If you didn t know  you re an idiot. 

If you did know  you re my enemy. 

Would you like to hear 

about our wedding night  

He never hurt my face. 

He needed my face  

the face of Ned Stark s daughter. 

But the rest of me  

he did what he liked with the rest of me 

as long as I could still give him an heir. 

What do you think he did  

  I can t begin to contemplate... 

  What do you think he did to me  

Lady Sansa asked you a question. 

He beat you. 

Yes  he enjoyed that. 

What else do you think he did  

  Sansa  I... 

  What else  

Did he cut you  

  Maybe you did know about 

Ramsay all along.   I didn t know. 

I thought you knew everyone s secrets. 

I made a mistake  

a horrible mistake. 

I underestimated a stranger. 

The other things he did  ladies 

aren t supposed to talk about those things  

but I imagine brothel keepers 

talk about them all the time. 

I can still feel it. 

I don t mean in my tender 

heart it still pains me so. 

I can still feel what he did in 

my body standing here right now. 

I m so sorry. 

You said you would protect me. 

And I will. 

  You must believe me when I tell you that I will. 

  I don t believe you anymore. 

I don t need you anymore. 

You can t protect me. 

You won t even be able to protect 

yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. 

And why shouldn t I  

Do you want me to beg for my life  

If that s what you want  I will. 

Whatever you ask that is in my power  

I will do. 

What if I want you to die here and now  

Then I will die. 

You freed me from the monsters 

who murdered my family 

and you gave me to other 

monsters who murdered my family. 

Go back to Moat Cailin. 

My brother and I will take back the North 

on our own. I never want to see you again. 

I would do anything to 

undo what s been done to you. 

I know that I can t. 

Will you allow me to say 

one more thing before I go  

Your great uncle Brynden the Blackfish 

has gathered what remains of 

the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. 

You might consider seeking him out. 

The time may come when 

you need an army loyal to you. 

  I have an army. 

  Your brother s army. 

Half brother. 

You re not ready. 

You should go home before it s too late. 

You ll never be one of us  Lady Stark. 

She has a point. 

None of the first Faceless Men 

were born to lords and ladies. 

They began as slaves 

in the mines of Valyria. 

  Who was the first  

  He was no one. 

The Many Faced God taught him how 

to shed his face and how to give the gift. 

The man taught others in 

exchange for their service. 

Many served  

many more gifts were given. 

Soon all the masters 

and overseers were gone 

and the Faceless Men fled. 

Where did they go  

Here. 

They founded the Free City 

of Braavos and built this house. 

These were the faces they wore in life 

when they were not wearing others. 

The first Faceless Men. 

And now a girl is one of them  

if a girl desires. 

A girl has no desires. 

Who  

An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. 

She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. 

A girl has been given a second chance. 

There will not be a third. 

One way or another  

a face will be added to the hall. 

Oh  murdered by a boar. 

The great big hairy whore. 

He dug in his tusks 

and dug out my guts 

and soon I am no more. 

Oh  come  Father  

in bed you must lie. 

I love you  Father. 

Please don t die. 

Shut up  you swine  

Cersei  more wine. 

I feel the winds of winter 

as they lick across the land. 

And our son alone on that cold  

cold throne without a guiding hand. 

Who will teach him strength  

Who will teach him grace  

To whom will he turn when it s time to 

learn to look darkness in the face  

Ned Stark will do fine. 

Now bring me more wine. 

Ooh  what s happened here  then  

He brought you here  Ned Stark  

 cause you re the brightest fellow in the land. 

You should be king of us all 

and I should be your Hand. 

We men of the North are right 

good hands at keeping people lawful. 

I d ask him for permission  

but he smells too bloody awful. 

I die  

I die  And here I now must lie. 

Oh  woe. Oh  no. 

Oh  I am about to go. 

  Will you stay on as Joffrey s Hand  

  The Iron Throne s what I demand. 

  You cannot. 

  I can. 

  You will not. 

  I will. 

  You dare not. 

  I dare yes. 

  The line of succession. 

  What s that mean  

  The proper progression. 

  What s that mean  

  The lawful ascension. 

  What s that mean  

So move along  give me my chair 

and there won t be no more trouble. 

But we had a deal all done and dusted. 

I m starting to think you can t be trusted. 

  Save my father. 

  Truly you should. 

Killing the man will do you no good. 

  Save him  please. 

  Show him mercy. 

Show the people what 

a good king should be. 

Good people  you may all relax. 

My father s friend shall be spared the... 

 i Father  No   i  

Oh  Father. Oh  

Worry not  

All is well. 

I have here a decree 

from my father Tywin Lannister  

the richest man you ll see. 

He proclaims me Hand of the King. 

The position s mine for life. 

And he s given me permission 

to take Sansa as my wife. 

You ll learn that what I lack in height  

I make up for in appetite. 

So let s forget about your plight  

and go rehearse our wedding night. 

It s a wart. Two warts. 

I ve got two fucking warts on my cock. 

Well  don t worry  love. 

They usually go away in five or six years. 

Oh  wash this  darling. It stinks of me. 

You can do better  Bianca  dear. 

You must do. 

I had two lines. 

There are no small parts. 

You rang very false. 

I rang very false  

What you need  love  

is for someone to ring you true. 

  You weren t complaining about me last night. 

  May I get you some wine  Lady Crane  

I m a rum girl  Bobono. 

  You need to know that if we re going to be 

intimate.   Of course we re going to be intimate. 

It s only a matter of time. 

  To our children. 

  May they have your talent. 

And your filthy mind. 

A girl will poison the rum. 

Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it. 

If a girl could use one 

of the faces from the hall... 

A girl is not ready. 

She s a good actress. 

So a man has heard. 

Seems like a decent woman. 

Does death only come for 

the wicked and leave the decent behind  

No. 

Who wants her dead  

That does not matter. 

The price was paid. 

The younger actress. 

She s jealous because Lady Crane is better. 

A girl must decide if she wants 

to serve the Many Faced God. 

A girl has decided. 

A servant does not ask questions. 

No  No  No  

It was you. 

You made the white walkers. 

We were at war. 

We were being slaughtered. 

Our sacred trees cut down. 

We needed to defend ourselves. 

From whom  

From you. 

From men. 

We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. 

In his name we gather today 

to choose a new king as our leader. 

Who makes a claim  

I am Yara Greyjoy  

daughter of Balon Greyjoy  

King of the Iron Islands. 

  I claim the Salt Throne. 

  We ve never had a queen. 

  Not once. 

  There are many things we ve never done. 

We ve never made 

our mark upon the world. 

The great lords 

of Westeros pay us no mind 

until our little raids buzz through their 

kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. 

Then they swat us down. 

They conquer us  humiliate us  

and go right back to forgetting we exist. 

 i Aye   i  

 i   We are a sea people. 

  Aye   i  

 i   Our god is a sea god. 

  Aye   i  

When I am queen  

we will build a fleet that... 

  You shall not be queen  

  I am not finished  

Yes  you are  

A woman will not lead us. 

Not when Balon s own 

male heir has returned. 

I am Theon Greyjoy... 

last living son of Balon Greyjoy. 

And she is your rightful ruler. 

 i Aye   i  

Those of you that have sailed under her  

and there are many of you here  

 i   you know what she is. 

  Aye   i  

 i   She is a reaver. 

  Aye   i  

 i   She is a warrior. 

  Aye   i  

 i   She is ironborn  

  Aye   i  

We will find no better leader. 

This is our queen. 

 i Yara  Yara  Yara   i  

I m Euron Greyjoy. 

I claim the Salt Throne. 

Niece. 

Nephew. 

Little Theon. 

Heard you managed to fuck 

things right into the ground. 

Captured a castle you couldn t keep. 

Got yourself taken prisoner. 

Even heard you have no cock. 

Explains why you think 

a woman can be king. 

  When did you return  Uncle  

  A few days ago. 

I had some things to take care of. 

Long overdue. 

I m glad you re here. 

Now I know what my 

first act as queen will be. 

To execute the man who killed my father. 

I did. 

I killed him. 

Threw him right over 

a rope bridge and watched him fall. 

He was leading us nowhere 

and we would still be heading 

there if it weren t for me. 

No one loved him. 

No one wanted to follow him. 

He led us into two wars we couldn t win. 

I apologize to you all for 

not killing him years ago. 

That would have been hard to do. 

You weren t here. 

Last I heard  you were gallivanting 

around the world having a grand old time. 

Gallivanting  

That the sort of thing you start 

to say once your dick gets chopped off  

Did the great lords of Westeros 

teach you words like that  

You were gone. 

Yara was here. 

Being ironborn. Leading ironborn. 

Getting ready to bring us back to glory. 

And how will she do that  

I will build the largest fleet 

the world has ever seen. 

Right idea  except I m the one 

who s going to build the Iron Fleet 

because I m the one 

who knows how to use it. 

I ve been all over the world. 

I ve seen more of it than all of you combined. 

And across the sea there is a person who hates 

the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. 

Someone with a large army  

three large dragons  and no husband. 

I m going to build that fleet 

and I m going to gallivant right over 

and give it to Daenerys Targaryen 

along with my big cock. 

You re going to 

seduce the Dragon Queen  

I m not going to seduce her. 

The Iron Fleet will seduce her. 

And together we re going 

to take the Seven Kingdoms. 

I wasn t born to be king. 

I paid the iron price and here I stand. 

 i Euron  Euron  Euron  Euron   i  

 i Euron  Euron  Euron  Euron   i  

 i Euron  Euron  Euron   i  

May Euron  your servant  

be born again from the sea as you were. 

 i Bless him with salt.  i  

 i Bless him with stone.  i  

 i Bless him with steel.  i  

 i Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.  i  

 i He is speaking to us and he says  i  

 i we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.  i  

Let the sea wash your follies 

and your vanities away. 

 i Let the old Euron drown.  i  

 i Let his lungs fill with seawater.  i  

 i Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.  i  

 i What is dead may never die  

but rises again harder and stronger.  i  

What is dead may never die. 

 i What is dead may never die.  i  

Where are my niece and nephew  

Let s go murder them. 

They stole our best ships. 

Won t be enough to save them. 

Go back to your homes. 

Chop down every tree you can find. 

Quarter saw the timber and start building. 

I want every man bending planks. 

I want every woman spinning flax for sails. 

Build me a thousand ships 

and I will give you this world. 

I banished you twice. 

You came back twice. 

And you saved my life. 

So I can t take you back 

and I can t send you away. 

You must send me away. 

Is there a cure  

I don t know. 

How long does it take  

I don t know that either. 

But I ve seen what happens 

when it goes far enough. 

I ll end things before that. 

I m sorry. 

  I m so sorry. 

  Don t be. 

All I ve ever wanted was to serve you. 

Tyrion Lannister was right. 

I love you. 

I ll always love you. 

Good bye  khaleesi. 

Do not walk away from your queen  

Jorah the Andal. 

You have not been dismissed. 

You pledged yourself to me. 

You swore to obey my commands 

for the rest of your life. 

Well  I command you to find the cure 

wherever it is in this world. 

I command you to heal yourself 

and then return to me. 

When I take the Seven Kingdoms  

I need you by my side. 

In the last fortnight since 

our pact with the Masters  

how many killings have been 

carried out by the Sons of the Harpy  

None. 

And how many Masters have 

been butchered by the free men  

Two  but that was the day of the pact. 

Since then  nothing. 

So it s safe to say that a 

fragile peace has taken hold. 

For now. 

For now is the best 

we get in our profession. 

It s not enough. 

Considering the city was on the 

brink of civil war  I d say it s a good start. 

It s not enough for 

Meereen to have peace. 

They need to know 

Daenerys is responsible for it. 

The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. 

Resist the foreign invaders. 

Our queen has an even better story. 

Mother of Dragons  

Breaker of Chains and all that. 

The people know 

who brought them freedom. 

Yes  but do they know 

who brought them security  

Who brought about 

an end to the violence  

We need someone the people trust  

someone they know 

cannot be bought or influenced. 

Sounds like quite the hero. 

Where would we find him  

Who said anything about  him   

That s about the extent of my Valyrian. 

Thank you for travelling all this way. 

I know from personal experience 

how uncomfortable the journey can be. 

The truth is we need your help. 

We had hoped that we could 

somehow persuade you to... 

You don t need to persuade me. 

I came to help. 

Daenerys Stormborn is 

the one who was promised. 

From the fire she was 

reborn to remake the world. 

Yes. 

She has freed the slaves from their 

chains and crucified the Masters for their sins. 

She did indeed. 

Her dragons are fire made flesh  

a gift from the Lord of Light. 

But you heard all of this before  

haven t you  On the Long Bridge of Volantis. 

The dragons will purify 

nonbelievers by the thousands  

burning their sins and flesh away. 

Ideally we d avoid purifying 

too many nonbelievers. 

The Mother of Dragons has 

followers of many different faiths. 

You want your queen 

to be worshipped and obeyed. 

And while she s gone  you want her 

advisors to be worshipped and obeyed. 

I d settle for obeyed. 

I will summon my most eloquent priests. 

They will spread the word. 

Daenerys has been sent to lead 

the people against the darkness 

in this war and in the 

great war still to come. 

  That sounds most excellent. 

  A man named Stannis Baratheon 

was anointed as the chosen 

one by one of your priestesses. 

He  too  had a glorious destiny. 

He attacked King s Landing and was 

soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. 

Last I had heard  

he had been defeated again  

this time at Winterfell 

and this time for good. 

We d be most grateful for any 

support you could provide the queen. 

I suppose it s hard for a 

fanatic to admit a mistake. 

Isn t that the whole 

point of being a fanatic  

You re always right. 

Everything is the Lord s will. 

Everything is the Lord s will. 

But men and women make mistakes. 

Even honest servants of the Lord. 

And you  an honest servant of the Lord  

why should I trust you to know any more 

than the priestess who counseled Stannis  

My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion  

but we are all loyal supporters of the queen. 

Everyone is what they are 

and where they are for a reason. 

Terrible things happen for a reason. 

Take what happened to you  

Lord Varys  when you were a child. 

If not for your mutilation 

at the hand of a second rate sorcerer  

you wouldn t be here 

helping the Lord s Chosen 

bring his light into the world. 

Knowledge has made you powerful. 

But there s still so much you don t know. 

Do you remember 

what you heard that night 

when the sorcerer 

tossed your parts in the fire  

You heard a voice call out 

from the flames. Do you remember  

Should I tell you what the voice said  

Should I tell you the 

name of the one who spoke  

We serve the same queen. 

If you are her true friend  

you have nothing to fear from me. 

What  

He saw me  the Night King  

  He saw me  

  He touched you. 

I don t know. He was close  but... 

He touched you. 

He knows you are here. 

He ll come for you. 

But he can t get in. 

He can now. 

His mark is on you. 

You must leave  all of you. 

Come on  Hodor. 

Help me with the sledge. 

Hodor. 

I m sorry. I didn t mean to. 

  The time has come. 

  The time for what  

For you to become me. 

But am I ready  

No. 

We can t defend the north from 

the walkers and the south from the Boltons. 

If we want to survive  we need Winterfell 

and to take Winterfell  we need more men. 

Aside from the Starks and the Boltons  

the most powerful houses in the North 

are the Umbers  

the Karstarks  and the Manderlys. 

The Umbers and the Karstarks 

have already declared for the Boltons  

so we re not doing so well there. 

The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. 

They can hang. 

But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay 

without knowing they had another choice. 

I beg your pardon  my lady  but they 

know that a Stark beheaded their father. 

I don t think we 

can count on them either. 

How well do you know 

the North  Ser Davos  

Precious little  my lady. 

My father always said 

Northerners are different. 

More loyal  more suspicious of outsiders. 

They may well be loyal  

but how many rose 

up against the Boltons 

when they betrayed your family  

I may not know the North  

but I know men. 

They re more or less the same in any corner 

of the world and even the bravest of them 

don t want to see their wives 

and children skinned for a lost cause. 

If Jon s going to convince 

them to fight alongside him  

they need to believe 

it s a fight they can win. 

There are more than three 

other houses in the North... 

Glover  Mormont  Cerwyn  

Mazin  Hornwood. 

Two dozen more. 

Together they equal all the others. 

We can start small and build. 

The North remembers. 

They remember the Stark name. 

People will still risk everything for it  from 

White Harbor to Ramsay s own door. 

I don t doubt it. 

But Jon doesn t have the Stark name. 

No  but I do. 

Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark s son 

as Ramsay is Roose Bolton s. 

And there are also the Tullys. 

They re not Northern  

but they will back us against 

the Boltons without question. 

I didn t know the Tullys still had an army. 

My uncle the Blackfish has 

reformed it and retaken Riverrun. 

How do you know that  

Ramsay received a raven 

before I escaped Winterfell. 

That s good. 

The Blackfish is a legend. 

His support would mean a great deal. 

Stark  Tully  a few more houses  

almost starts to look like a winning side. 

I ve sworn to protect you  my lady. 

You heard them. We need more men 

and my uncle has an army. 

We can send the Blackfish a raven. 

Can t risk Ramsay intercepting it. 

It has to be you. 

Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk 

to you and you ll know how to talk to him. 

What is it  

I don t like leaving you here alone. 

With Jon  

Not him. He seems trustworthy. 

A bit brooding  perhaps. 

I suppose that s understandable  considering. 

The others  though. 

Davos and the Red Woman 

helped a man murder his own brother 

with bloodmagic. 

And when Stannis paid for 

his crime  where were they  

Already out looking for a 

leader with better prospects. 

And that wildling fellow with the beard... 

Jon isn t Tormund. 

Jon isn t Davos  the Red Woman 

or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. 

He s my brother. 

He ll keep me safe. I trust him. 

Then why did you lie to him when he 

asked you how you learned about Riverrun  

New dress  

I made it myself. Do you like it  

Yeah  it s... 

I like the wolf bit. 

Good  because I made this for you. 

I made it like the one Father used to wear. 

As near as I can remember. 

Thank you  Sansa. 

You re welcome. 

Don t knock it down while I m gone. 

I ll do my best. 

Good luck. 

Should we close the gate  Lord Commander  

I m not the Lord Comman... 

Yeah  ahem  close the bloody gate. 

We can go home now  Hodor. 

Well  maybe not home home  

but somewhere that isn t a cave. 

Hodor. 

Eat something that isn t moss. 

I want an egg. 

How do you like  em  

Boiled  Fried up with some butter  

Hodor. 

With a rasher of bacon 

and some blood sausage. 

Hodor. 

Get Bran and run

Out  all of you. 

Bastard s been meddling 

where he shouldn t  

I want you and your men 

gone. 

And you will make 

this right. 

Wait outside. 

  Lord Commander. 

  Now  

  Lord Commander. 

  Leave us. 

What did you do  

I followed him. 

He took the baby 

into the woods  the newborn. 

What business is that 

of yours  

No  you don t understand. 

He s killing them  

all the boys. 

You know. 

The wildlings serve 

crueler Gods than you or I. 

Those boys 

are Craster s offerings. 

Offerings  

He s murdering his own children. 

He s a monster. 

Aye  many a time that monster 

has been the difference 

between life and death 

for our Rangers. 

Your Uncle among them. 

We have other wars 

to fight out there. 

Like it or not  

we need men like Craster. 

I... 

I saw it. 

I saw... 

Something take 

that child. 

Yeah. 

Whatever it was  

I daresay 

you ll see it again. 

Now ready my horse. 

We leave at dawn. 

Don t lose it again. 

Gilly. 

You re leaving. 

I   I wanted 

to give you something. 

It belonged 

to my mother. 

  I can t take it. 

  Please. 

I want you to. 

My mother used it 

for sewing. 

She d let me sit with her 

in her chamber while she sewed 

and I d read to her. 

My father put a stop 

to it when he found out. 

It s the only thing 

I have of hers. 

She gave it to me 

before I left for the Wall. 

You   

you shouldn t 

give it away. 

I m not giving it away. 

I m giving it to you. 

Keep it safe for me. 

Till I come back. 

Hodor. 

Hodor. 

Rouse Bran  will you  

It s time for his lessons. 

 i Every night it s the same.  i  

I m walking 

and running  but... 

I m not   

I m not me. 

I m running 

through the Godswood  

sniffing the dirt  

tasting blood in my mouth when 

I ve made a fresh kill  

howling. 

Old Nan used to 

tell me stories 

about magical people 

who could live 

inside stags  

birds  wolves. 

That s exactly 

what they are  Bran   

  stories. 

  So she was lying  

  They don t exist  

  Well  they may have done. 

But they re gone 

from the world 

along with much else. 

These are dreams  Bran  

nothing more. 

No  my dreams 

are different. 

 i Mine are true.  i  

I dreamt of my father dying. 

And Rickon had 

the same dream. 

What about all the dreams 

you had that didn t come true  

Hmm  

Right. 

This link is made 

of Valyrian steel. 

Only one Maester in  

wears it on his chain. 

It signifies that I have 

studied the higher mysteries. 

And all who study these mysteries 

try their hand at spells. 

I was no different. 

I was young. 

And what boy doesn t secretly 

wish for hidden powers 

to lift him out of his 

dull life into a special one  

But in the end  

for all my efforts  

I got no more out of it 

than   boys before me. 

Come on. 

All right. 

Maybe magic once was 

a mighty force in the world. 

But not anymore. 

The Dragons are gone. 

The Giants are dead. 

And the Children 

of the Forest forgotten. 

Loras  

Highgarden  

Get him  

Oh  

Yield  

I yield. 

Well fought. 

Approach. 

Rise. 

Remove your helm. 

You are all your father 

promised and more  My Lady. 

I ve seen Ser Loras 

bested once or twice  

but never quite 

in that fashion. 

Now  now  my love. My brother 

fought valiantly for you. 

That he did  my Queen. 

But there can only be 

one champion. 

Brienne of Tarth  

 i you may ask anything  i  

 i of me you desire.  i  

If it is within my power  

it is yours. 

Your Grace  

I ask the honor of a place 

in your Kingsguard. 

What  

I will be one of your seven  

pledge my life to yours  

and keep you safe 

from all harm. 

Done. 

Rise  Brienne 

of the Kingsguard. 

Your Grace  I have the honor to 

bring you Lady Catelyn Stark  

sent as an envoy by her son Robb  

Lord of Winterfell. 

Lord of Winterfell 

and King in the North. 

Lady Catelyn. 

I m pleased to see you. 

May I present my wife 

Margaery of House Tyrell  

You are very welcome 

here  Lady Stark. 

I m so sorry 

for your loss. 

You are most kind. 

My Lady  

I swear to you I will see 

the Lannisters answer 

for your husband s murder. 

When I take King s Landing  

I ll bring you 

Joffrey s head. 

It will be enough to know that 

justice was done  My Lord. 

 i Your Grace.  i  

And you should kneel 

when you approach the King. 

There s no need for that. 

Lady Stark is an honored guest. 

Has your son marched against 

Tywin Lannister yet  

I do not sit on 

my son s war councils. 

And if I did  I would not share his 

strategies with you. 

If Robb Stark wants a pact with us  

he should come himself  

not hide behind 

his mother s skirts. 

My son is fighting a war  

not playing at one. 

Don t worry  My Lady. 

Our war is just beginning. 

  Your Grace. 

  Gerard. 

  How s your foot  

  Better  Your Grace. 

They don t know 

their own size is all. 

Good man. 

I have   men 

at my command. 

All the might of the Stormlands 

and the Reach. 

And all of them young and bold 

like your Knight of Flowers  

It s a game to you  

isn t it  

  I pity them. 

  Why  

Because it won t last. 

Because they are the Knights of summer 

and winter is coming. 

Brienne  escort 

Lady Catelyn to her tent. 

  She s tired from her journey. 

   i At once  Your Grace.  i  

  Shall I return after  

   i That won t be necessary.  i  

I would pray awhile. 

Alone. 

If you ll follow me  

My Lady. 

You fought bravely today  

Lady Brienne. 

I fought for my King. 

Soon I ll fight for him 

on the battlefield. 

Die for him 

if I must. 

And  if it please you  

Brienne s enough. 

I m no lady. 

What are you doing here  

I live here. 

  Are you angry with me  brother  

  You lying bitch. 

It s not my fault 

you didn t recognize me. 

Recognize you  

How could I  

The last time I saw you... 

You looked like 

a fat little boy. 

You were a fat 

little boy  too  

but I recognized you. 

Why didn t you tell me  

I wanted to see 

who you were first. 

And I did. 

The plans are made. 

It s time you heard them. 

  Father. 

  Father. 

The wolf pup 

has gone south 

with the entirety of the northern 

army at his back. 

While he s tangling with 

the lion in the Westerlands  

the north is ripe 

for the taking. 

The Ironborn will reave and 

pillage as it was in the old days 

all along the northern coast. 

We ll spread our dominion 

across the green lands  

 i securing the Neck  i  

 i and everything above.  i  

Every stronghold will yield 

to us one by one. 

Winterfell may defy us 

for a year  but what of it  

The rest shall be ours   

forest  field and hall. 

Yara  my daughter  

you ll take  longships 

 i to attack Deepwood Motte.  i  

I ve always wanted 

a castle. 

And what s my role 

in all this  

You ll take a ship to raid the 

fishing villages on the Stoney Shore. 

A ship  

You give her  

and I get one  

The sea bitch. We thought 

she d be perfect for you. 

I m to fight fishermen  

Be careful 

of their nets. 

Father  I fought with Robb Stark. 

I know his men. 

He won t give up 

the North so easily. 

They won t even know we re 

there until it s too late. 

What do you 

know of it  woman  

I m a proven warrior. 

Your brothers were warriors  

both of them dead 

at the hands of those 

you seem so eager to protect. 

I m not protecting anyone. 

I just wonder 

if it s not wiser to wait. 

Why risk going against the North 

if they would be our allies  

Rise up against them 

and they could destroy us. 

But if we pledge 

fealty to them  

they ll give us 

Casterly Rock. 

What are our words  

Our words  

   We do not sow.  

   We do not sow.  

We are Ironborn. 

We re not subjects. 

We re not slaves. 

We do not plow the fields 

or toil in the mine. 

We take what is ours. 

Your time with the wolves 

has made you weak. 

You act as if 

I volunteered to go. 

You gave me away  

if you remember. 

The day you bent the knee 

to Robert Baratheon. 

After he crushed you. 

Did you take 

what was yours then  

You gave me away  

Your boy  

Your last boy  

You gave me away like I was some dog 

you didn t want anymore. 

And now you curse me 

because I ve come home. 

You d have our father bow 

down to your other family  

I have no other family. 

Don t you  

Make your choice  Theon  

and do it quickly. 

Our ships sail 

with or without you. 

You won t let me 

leave this room. 

  You won t let me   

  Shh  shh  keep your voice down. 

Why  You think your father 

can hear me  

He s  miles away  

I don t intend for you 

to stay here. 

I might be able to bring you into 

the castle kitchens. 

Again  only temporary. 

Every man who has 

tasted my cooking 

has told me what 

a good whore I am. 

But you wouldn t 

be a cook. 

You d pose 

as a scullion. 

Scullion  

What is a scullion  

Kitchen wench. 

  A kitchen wench  

  Yes  but   

Cleaning pots  

Is that how my lion 

wants to see me  

Your lion wants 

to see you alive. 

We ve come to 

a dangerous place. 

My sister wants to hurt me. 

She ll look for any 

weakness she can find. 

She can t know about you. 

I m the weakness  

It s a compliment  

My Lady. 

How is being a weakness 

a compliment  

Language can be 

a bit tricky here. 

Oh  I m too stupid 

to understand. 

The stupid foreign girl. 

I am not 

a kitchen wench. 

When will Joffrey 

and Sansa be married  

Soon  darling  

when the war is over. 

Mother says I ll have 

a new gown for the ceremony 

and another for the feast. 

But yours will be ivory 

since you re the bride. 

The Princess 

just spoke to you. 

Pardon  Your Grace. 

I m sure your dress will 

be beautiful  Myrcella. 

I m counting the days 

until the fighting is done 

and I can pledge my love to 

the King in sight of the Gods. 

Is Joffrey going to kill 

Sansa s brother  

He might. 

Would you like that  

No. 

I don t think so. 

Even if he does  

Sansa will do her duty. 

Won t you  little dove  

Come in. 

Who are you  

I m Shae  My Lady. 

Your new handmaiden. 

I didn t know I needed 

a new handmaiden. 

  You re not from here. 

  No. 

What are you doing  

Waiting for you 

to tell me what to do. 

I shouldn t have to tell 

you to do things. 

You should just do them. 

What things  

Change my linens  

wash my clothing  

scrub the floor  empty my chamber pot  

brush my hair. 

  No. 

  You said to brush   

Not now. 

Your chamber pot 

is empty. 

Clean the table. 

Have you ever been 

a handmaiden before  

  Yes. 

  For whom  

  Lady Zuriff. 

  Lady Zuriff  

Lady Zuriff. 

There is no Lady Zuriff 

in this city. 

She wasn t in 

this city. 

Well  I don t know how 

they did things in that city  

but in this city  

handmaidens wait on ladies  

not the other way around. 

And I don t have time 

to answer   questions 

and teach you 

how to do your job. 

Do you want me to leave  

Just brush my hair. 

Oh  thank the Gods. 

I haven t had 

a proper shit in six days. 

I ve encountered this 

problem before  My Lord. 

The stresses of power 

often have this 

insalubrious effect. 

Two drops 

with water daily. 

Right. I m so grateful 

to have a man 

of your vast knowledge 

and wisdom on my side. 

  Please. 

  Thank you  My Lord. 

I can trust you  

Pycelle  can I not  

Why  yes  of course  

My Lord. 

These are perilous times. 

And the crown must forge 

new alliances. 

And these alliances must often 

be sealed in matrimony. 

Matrimony  huh  

Yes. 

I m trusting the council 

with these plans  

but the queen mustn t know. 

We can t have her 

meddling in affairs 

that could determine 

the future of the realm. 

There s too much at stake. 

Oh  yes  yes. 

Indeed  yes. 

I shall be silent 

as the grave. 

I m brokering an alliance 

with House Martell of Dorne. 

Princess Myrcella will wed 

their youngest son 

when she comes of age  

ensuring their loyalty 

and their army 

should we need it. 

Myrcella sent away 

to Dorne  

But remember  

the queen mustn t know. 

Ooh   the queen 

mustn t know.  

I love conversations 

that begin this way. 

I plan to marry 

Princess Myrcella off 

to Theon Greyjoy. 

Theon Greyjoy  

Forgive me  My Lord   

He grew up a ward 

of Winterfell. 

He fights 

for Robb Stark. 

Precisely. Theon s father 

loathes the Starks 

and will convince the boy 

to come to our side. 

Greyjoy can destroy 

the northern army from within 

 i and we can have  i  

 i his father s ships.  i  

But remember  

you must tell no one. 

Tell no one what  

I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to 

Robin Arryn of the Vale. 

Lysa is not fond of me. 

But perhaps the promise 

of a royal match 

will convince her 

to let bygones be bygones. 

She imprisoned you. 

She tried 

to execute you. 

And you offer 

her son a princess  

For men in our position  

holding grudges can be 

an encumbrance  

don t you think  

And I suppose you want me 

to broker this agreement  

Who better  

Yes  I could sing 

this song to Lysa  

if I cared to. 

What s in it 

for me  

The gratitude of 

the people of Westeros 

for helping to end 

this war  

the adoration of the King for 

bringing the Vale back into the fold... 

and Harrenhal. 

Harrenhal is cursed. 

Never took you 

for a superstitious man. 

By all means  

tear it down and rebuild. 

You ll be able 

to afford it. 

I plan to make you 

Lord of the Riverlands. 

With a single stroke  

you d make me one of the 

greatest lords in the realm. 

You served my family well 

in the matter of the succession. 

So did Janos Slynt  and he 

was given Harrenhal  too. 

Until you snatched it away. 

I need you to 

deliver Lysa Arryn. 

I didn t need 

Janos Slynt. 

 i It s settled  then   i  

Good. 

Oh  and remember   

the queen mustn t know. 

That must hurt. 

What  

What is it  

A member of the Kingsguard  

As if I wasn t humiliated 

enough already. 

Brienne is a very 

capable warrior. 

And she s devoted to me. 

You re jealous. 

Jealous  

Of Brienne the beauty  

Don t make me laugh. 

  I ll make it up to you. 

  No  Your Grace. 

Not tonight. 

There s another Tyrell 

who requires your attention. 

You didn t win 

my father s support 

or his army 

on charm alone. 

Your vassals are starting 

to snigger behind your back. 

Brides aren t usually virgins 

two weeks after their wedding night. 

And Margaery s a virgin  

Officially. 

Shall I bring her 

to you  

I should warn you  

I ve had quite 

a bit of wine. 

As is your right. 

You are a King. 

You look 

very beautiful. 

Thank you  

Your Grace. 

  It s a lovely gown. 

   i You think so   i  

I can t decide 

how I like it better. 

This way... 

or this way. 

You certainly don t need it. 

Although... 

some say that 

beauty most desired 

is the beauty concealed. 

Must be the wine. 

Here  let me. 

I m sorry. 

Do you want my brother 

to come in and help  

  What  

  He could get you started. 

I know he wouldn t mind. 

Or I can turn over and you 

can pretend I m him. 

I don t know what 

you re talking about. 

There s no need 

for us to play games. 

Save your lies for court. 

You re going to need a lot of them. 

Your enemies 

aren t happy about us. 

They want to tear 

us apart. 

And the best way 

to stop them 

is to put your baby 

in my belly. 

We can try again later. 

You decide how 

you want to do it   

with me  

with me and Loras. 

However else you like. 

Whatever you need to do. 

You are a King. 

 i You monster.  i  

Myrcella is my only daughter. 

Do you really think I ll let you 

sell her like a common whore  

Myrcella s a Princess. 

Some would say 

she was born for this. 

I will not let you 

ship her off to Dorne 

as I was shipped off 

to Robert Baratheon. 

Dorne is the safest place 

or her. 

Are you mad  

The Martells loathe us. 

That s why we need 

to seduce them. 

We re going to need 

their support in the war 

your son started. 

  She ll be a hostage. 

  A guest. 

You won t get away 

with this. 

You think the piece of paper father 

gave you keeps you safe. 

Ned Stark had a piece 

of paper  too. 

  It s done  Cersei. 

  No. 

  You cannot stop it. 

  No  

 i Just how safe do you think  i  

 i Myrcella is if this city falls   i  

Do you want to see her raped  

butchered like the Targaryen children  

Make no mistake. 

They ll mount her pretty little head 

on a spike right beside yours. 

Get out  

Get out  

Theon of 

the House Greyjoy  

you would this day consecrate 

your faith to the drowned God  

  I would. 

   i Kneel.  i  

Let Theon  

your servant  

be born again from 

the sea as you were. 

Bless him with salt. 

Bless him with stone. 

Bless him with steel. 

What is dead 

may never die. 

What is dead 

may never die... 

But rises again 

harder and stronger. 

Stand. 

I don t appreciate being 

made a fool of  dwarf. 

If Myrcella marries 

the Martell boy  

she can t very well 

marry Robin Arryn  can she  

No  afraid not. 

Sorry about that. 

And Harrenhal   

I suppose that s 

off the table as well. 

Yes  I fear so. 

Sorry about that  too. 

Leave me out of your 

next deception. 

Oh  that s a shame. 

You were to be the centerpiece of 

my next deception. 

My brother Jaime rots 

in a Northern stockade. 

I would see him released. 

That s where you come in. 

Robb Stark will never 

release the Kingslayer. 

No  he won t. 

But his mother might. 

How would you like to see 

your beloved Cat again  

  Find him  

  Oh  aye. 

And he has company. 

Filthy old stoat. 

Almost hate to interrupt. 

  No  you don t. 

  No  I don t. 

What is the meaning 

of this  

No  please  please. 

You disappoint me  

Grand Maester. 

I am your loyal servant. 

So loyal that you told 

the Queen about my plans 

to send Myrcella to Dorne. 

No  Never  

It s a falsehood. 

I swear it. 

It wasn t me. 

Ah  Varys. 

It was Varys 

the spider. 

See  I told Varys that I was giving 

the Princess to the Greyjoys. 

I told Littlefinger that I planned 

to wed her to Robin Arryn. 

I told no one that I was 

offering her to the Dornish. 

No one but you. 

The eunuch has 

spies everywhere. 

Cut off his manhood 

and feed it to the goats. 

  No  no  no. 

  There are no goats  halfman. 

Well  make do. 

How long have you 

been spying for my sister  

All I did  I did 

for House Lannister. 

 i Always. Your lord father   i  

 i ask him.  i  

I ve always been 

his servant 

since the days 

of the Mad King. 

  I don t like his beard. 

  What  

What  

Oh  no. No. 

How many hands have you 

betrayed  Pycelle  

Eddard Stark  

Jon Arryn  

Lord Arryn  

he knew. 

He knew the truth 

about the queen. 

And  well  

he planned to act  

to tell King Robert. 

So you poisoned him  

No. Never. 

But you let him die  

made sure he succumbed. 

Lannister   

I always served Lannister. 

Get him out of my sight. 

Throw him in one of the black cells. 

Oh  no. No  no  no. 

No  please. 

 i Don t   i  

 i You can t do this to me   i  

For your trouble. 

You ll be pleased to know 

our mutual friend 

 i is doing quite well  i  

 i in Lady Sansa s service.  i  

Good. 

One of my better ideas. 

And it seems 

the Grand Maester 

has found his way 

into a black cell. 

Well played  

My Lord Hand. 

But should I be worried  

Janos Slynt  

Pycelle   

the small council 

grows smaller every day. 

The council has a reputation 

for serving past Hands poorly. 

I don t mean to follow 

Ned Stark to the grave. 

Power is a curious thing  

My Lord. 

Are you fond of riddles  

Why  am I about 

to hear one  

Three great men 

sit in a room. 

A king  a priest 

and a rich man. 

Between them stands 

a common Sellsword. 

 i Each great man bids the  i  

 i Sellsword kill the other two.  i  

Who lives  who dies  

Depends on the Sellsword. 

Does it  

He has neither crown 

nor gold nor favor 

with the Gods. 

He has a sword  

the power of life and death. 

But if it s swordsmen 

who rule  

why do we pretend 

Kings hold all the power  

 i When Ned Stark  i  

 i lost his head   i  

 i who was truly responsible   i  

Joffrey  

The executioner  

Or something else  

I ve decided 

I don t like riddles. 

Power resides where 

men believe it resides. 

It s a trick  

a shadow on the wall. 

And a very small man 

can cast a very large shadow. 

You should be sleeping. 

Tomorrow s a long march. 

 miles if it 

don t piss on us. 

I can t sleep. 

I don t like the taste. 

Well... 

You don t drink it 

for the flavor  to be honest. 

What  

How do you sleep  

Same as most men  

I think. 

But you ve seen things  

horrible things. 

Aye. 

I ve seen some 

pretty things  too  

but not nearly so many. 

How do you sleep 

when you   

when you have those 

things in your head  

You didn t see that. 

I made damn sure. 

I close my eyes 

and I see them up there. 

All of them 

standing there   

Joffrey  

the Queen  

and   

and my sister. 

You know  we ve got something 

in common  me and you. 

You know that  

I must have been 

a couple of years 

older than you. 

I saw my brother stabbed 

through the heart 

 i right on our doorstep.  i  

 i He weren t much of a villain  i  

 i what skewered him.  i  

 i Willem  the lad s name was.  i  

He ran off before 

anyone could spit. 

And I just stood there  

watching my brother die. 

 i But here s the funny part.  i  

I can t picture 

my brother s face anymore. 

 i But Willem    i  

oh  he was 

a nice looking boy. 

He had good white teeth  

blue eyes  

 i one of those dimpled chins  i  

 i all the girls like.  i  

 i I would think about him  i  

 i when I was working   i  

when I was drinking  

when I was having a shit. 

It got to the point 

where I would say his name 

every night before I went to bed. 

Willem. Willem. 

 i Willem.  i  

A prayer almost. 

 i Well  one day...  i  

 i Willem came riding  i  

 i back into town.  i  

I buried an ax so deep 

into Willem s skull  

 i they had to bury  i  

 i him with it.  i  

Willem s horse 

got me to the Wall 

and I ve been wearing 

black ever since. 

Well... 

that ll help you sleep  eh  

Ho  

Get up  you lazy 

sons of whores  

Arm yourselves. 

  Get up. 

  Get up. 

Keep out of sight  

both of you. 

  No  I m not afraid. 

  I can fight. 

Keep out of sight. 

If things go wrong  

you run. 

Do you hear me  

You run along North 

and don t look back. 

Hey  there s men 

out there 

who want to fuck 

your corpses. 

Outside  now  

 i Come on  move  move   i  

Gold Cloaks  

Everyone out  

Hey  you  

Open the damn cage  

Where s the bastard  Crow  

Got more than a few bastards here. 

Who s asking  

Ser Amory Lorch  sworn Bannerman 

to Lord Tywin Lannister. 

 i These men from the capital  i  

 i requested our assistance.  i  

Drop your weapons 

in the name of the King. 

Now  which King 

would that be  

This is your last chance. 

In the name 

of King Joffrey  

drop your weapons. 

I don t think I will. 

So be it. 

I always hated crossbows. 

Take too long to load. 

Boy  come here. 

Boy  

  Sweet boy  help us. 

  Come back here  

Help us  boy  

A man can fight  

Free us  

Quick  give it to me. 

Give me the ax. 

Give me that. 

 i Put  em on the wagon   i  

 i There s more here.  i  

 i Come on.  i  

What do we have here  

No  

That s a fine 

little blade. 

Maybe I ll pick 

my teeth with it. 

I yield  

I yield  

 i Round up any survivors.  i  

We ll take them back 

to Harrenhal. 

You heard him. 

You re coming with us. 

I yield  

Help  

Help me  

Something wrong 

with your leg  boy  

Look at it. 

Can you walk  

No. 

You got to carry me. 

All right. 

Carry him  he says. 

We re looking for 

a bastard named Gendry. 

 i Give him up  i  

or I ll start 

taking eyeballs. 

You want Gendry  

You already got him. 

 i He loved that helmet.  i  

 i You think I can t hear you  i  

 i every day talking about visions  i  

 i and three eyed ravens  i  

 i and black magic   i  

I don t want you talking to him 

till we get to Castle Black. 

We re not going to Castle Black. 

Jon Snow isn t there. 

Bran needs to find 

the raven beyond the Wall. 

Oh  no  I m not 

going back there. 

I promised your maester I d get you 

to Castle Black and no further. 

You won t win. 

You don t have the discipline. 

  You don t know how to fight together. 

  You don t know that. 

If you attack the Wall 

you ll die  all of you. 

All of  i us.  i  

I can t force them 

to meet us in the field. 

  Casterly Rock can t run away. 

  Can you do it  

There is only one person 

in this kingdom 

with that kind of army. 

Walder Frey. 

We will do whatever we can to 

give Lord Frey what he needs. 

Our father requires Lord Edmure 

to wed one of his daughters. 

  You were sent here to kill me  

  I don t want to. 

What do your captains 

have to say about that  

 i You should ask them.  i  

Will you fight for me  

The Second Sons are yours 

and so is Daario Naharis. 

My sword is yours  

my life is yours  

my heart is yours. 

  Is that the Blackwater  

  Where do you think I m taking you  

  Back to King s Landing. 

  That s the Red Fork. 

I m taking you to the Twins. 

Your uncle s marrying 

one of the Frey girls. 

Your mother and brother 

will be there 

and they ll pay me for you. 

That rain will cost 

us another day. 

Lord Frey will take 

this delay as a slight. 

  He s getting the wedding he wanted. 

  He s getting a wedding. 

 i It was a king he wanted.  i  

It s come for the baby. 

You stay back  

No  you can t have him. 

 i No   i  

 i Are you sure about this   i  

No. 

It s dangerous. 

If we take Tywin s 

castle from him  

the lords of Westeros will 

realize he s not invincible. 

Take his home  

take his gold  take his power. 

Why are you telling me  

You begged me not to send Theon 

to negotiate with his father 

and I ignored your advice. 

Now Winterfell is burnt 

to the ground  

the North is overrun 

with ironborn  

and Bran and Rickon are gone. 

So Casterly Rock... 

I m asking your advice. 

We have enough men  

If Walder Frey cooperates. 

If Walder Frey cooperates. 

If reinforcements arrive 

from King s Landing 

 i before we take the castle...  i  

we ll be caught between 

Tywin s army and the sea. 

We ll lose the war and die 

the way Father died. 

Or worse. 

Show them how it feels 

to lose what they love. 

 i My honored guests...  i  

be welcome within my walls 

and at my table. 

 i I extend to you my hospitality  i  

and protection 

in the light of the Seven. 

We thank you for your 

hospitality  my lord. 

I have come to make 

my apologies  my lord  

and to beg your forgiveness. 

Don t beg my forgiveness  

Your Grace. 

It wasn t me you spurned. 

It was my girls. 

 i One of them was supposed  i  

 i to be queen.  i  

Now none of them are. 

This is Arwyen my daughter. 

 i My daughter Walda   i  

 i my daughter Derwa   i  

 i my daughter Waldra.  i  

My eldest granddaughters 

 i Ginia and Neila.  i  

 i Serra and Sarra   i  

 i granddaughters  twins.  i  

You could have had either. 

 i Could have had both  i  

 i for all I care.  i  

My granddaughter Marianne. 

 i My granddaughter Freya.  i  

My granddaughter... 

Wertha. 

 i Waldra.  i  

Waldina. 

  I m Merry. 

  Fine. 

And here s my youngest 

daughter Shirei  

 i though she hasn t bled yet.  i  

Clearly you don t have 

the patience for all that. 

My ladies. 

All men should keep their 

word  kings most of all. 

I was pledged to marry one 

of you and I broke that vow. 

 i The fault is not with you.  i  

 i Any man would be lucky  i  

 i to have any one of you.  i  

 i I did what I did  i  

 i not to slight you   i  

but because I loved another. 

 i I know these words  i  

 i cannot set right  i  

 i the wrong I have done  i  

 i to you and your house.  i  

I beg your forgiveness 

and pledge to do 

all I can to make amends 

so the Freys of the Crossing 

and the Starks of Winterfell 

may once again be friends. 

 i Very good.  i  

There she is. 

 i Come closer.  i  

Let me have a look at you. 

Still can t see you. 

Old eyes. 

Love. 

 i That s what the Starks  i  

 i of Winterfell call it  eh   i  

Very honorable. 

I call it a pretty face. 

Mmm  very pretty. 

Prettier than this lot  

that s for sure. 

Very shapely as well. 

 i Oh  you try to hide her  i  

 i under that dress.  i  

If you wanted to hide her  

you shouldn t have brought her 

here in the first place. 

I can always see 

what s going on 

beneath a dress. 

 i Been at this a long time.  i  

 i I bet when you take  i  

 i that dress off   i  

everything stays 

right where it is. 

Doesn t drop an inch. 

Your king says he betrayed 

me for love. 

I say he betrayed me 

for firm tits 

and a tight fit. 

And I can respect that. 

When I was your age  

I d have broken  oaths 

to get into that 

without a second thought. 

Well  I ve enough room 

in the hall for you lot. 

We ll set up tents outside 

with food and ale 

for the rest of your men. 

Thank you  my lord. 

Well  let s get ready. 

The wine will flow red 

 i and the music will play loud  i  

and we ll put 

this mess behind us. 

Where  

There. 

There. 

It s a back gate. 

My men use it when they 

visit Yunkai s bed slaves. 

Your men  but not you  

 i I have no 

interest in slaves.  i  

A man cannot make love 

to property. 

This is where 

we enter the city. 

Very few guards. 

They know me. 

They let me inside   

We re not gonna sneak 

an army through a back gate. 

I kill the guards. 

I take your two best men 

and lead them through the back 

streets  which I know well  

and open the front gates. 

Then comes the army. 

Once the walls are breached  

the city will fall in hours. 

Or perhaps you ll lead Grey 

Worm and me to the slaughter  

cutting the head off our army. 

 i The masters of Yunkai  i  

 i will pay you your fee  i  

and you won t have 

to split it three ways 

 cause you ve already 

slaughtered your partners. 

You have 

a very suspicious mind. 

In my experience  only dishonest 

people think this way. 

You command the Unsullied. 

 i What do you think   i  

You leave tonight. 

Very good. 

We ll prepare. 

Ser Jorah. 

You can use an extra sword. 

You re the Queensguard  

Ser Barristan. 

Your place is by the queen. 

If we are truly 

her loyal servants  

we ll do whatever 

needs to be done 

no matter the cost  

no matter our pride. 

We re west of Castle Black  

but the Nightfort s 

closest to us. 

It was the first 

castle on the Wall. 

The Watch abandoned it during 

the reign of King Jaehaerys I. 

Too big. 

Impossible to maintain. 

Other than Castle Black itself  

the Nightfort s 

the perfect castle for us. 

It s got a secret sally port  

the Black Gate  

as old as the Wall itself. 

No one s used it 

in centuries most likely. 

It leads through the Wall 

right down into the Nightfort  

if one knows how to find it  

which  it just 

so happens  I do. 

How do you know all that  

I read about it 

in a very old book. 

You know all that 

from staring at marks on paper  

Yes. 

You re like a wizard. 

Our father used to tell us 

that no wildling ever looked 

upon the Wall and lived. 

Here we are. 

Alive. 

Remember what happens 

to children who run. 

I m your father 

and I ll do the talking. 

The roads have gone 

right to hell  haven t they  

Cracked three spokes 

this morning. 

  Need a hand  

  Need about eight hands. 

Oh  

Got to get this 

salt pork to the Twins 

in time for the wedding. 

Many thanks. 

Don t  

Don t kill him. 

Dead rats don t squeak. 

You re so dangerous  

aren t you  

Saying scary things 

to little girls. 

Killing little boys 

and old people. 

A real hard man you are. 

More than anyone you know. 

You re wrong. 

I know a killer. 

  A real killer. 

  That so  

You d be like a kitten to him. 

He d kill you 

with his little finger. 

That him  

  No. 

  Good. 

Don t kill him. 

Please. 

Please don t. 

You re very kind. 

Someday it ll get you killed. 

Where are we  

The Gift  I think. 

Brandon the Builder 

gave all this land 

 i south of the Wall  i  

 i to the Night s Watch  i  

for their sustenance 

and support. 

Maester Luwin taught me that. 

Doesn t seem to be supporting 

anyone at the moment. 

It s good land 

and there s no war up here. 

Why leave  

Wildlings. 

Sorry. 

But they come over 

the Wall and raid  

steal  carry off women. 

Old Nan said they turn 

your skull into a cup 

and make you drink 

your own blood from it. 

That s what Old Nan said. 

There s a storm coming. 

I don t see any   

It s as good a place 

to shelter as any. 

We can drink some blood 

while we wait. 

I don t need much. 

Only one old man 

and eight good horses. 

What s one old man 

doing with eight horses  

He breeds them for the Watch. 

How s he keep folks 

from stealing them  

The Watch protects him. 

Not today they don t. 

He s selling horses  

he s got some gold in there. 

 i   And proper steel.  i  

  Let s carve him up. 

We just take the horses and go. 

The old man s no threat. 

I keep telling you. 

He s an old man. 

A spear through the heart s 

a better way to die 

than coughing up your last with 

no one but your horses to hear. 

The Watch might send a few men 

looking for a horse thief. 

They ll send a lot more 

to hunt down murderers. 

I hope so. 

Killing crows 

in their castle is tough. 

Killing them out here 

in the open  

that s what we do. 

Spread out. 

Surround the hut and move in. 

Ygritte  

 i Clear the barn   i  

No one s going to believe you re a 

hog farmer if you eat them all. 

Best part of the animal. 

Don t worry. 

They re still there. 

I know they re still there. 

You check every five minutes 

like you re afraid 

they re gonna move. 

I m not afraid. 

Of course you are. 

You re almost there 

and you re afraid 

you won t make it. 

The closer you get  

the worse the fear gets. 

No point in trying to hide 

behind that face. 

 i I know fear when I see it.  i  

Seen it a lot. 

I knew fear 

when I saw it in you. 

You re afraid of fire. 

When Beric s sword 

went up in flames  

you looked like 

a scared little girl. 

And I know why  too. 

 i I heard what  i  

 i your brother did to you.  i  

Pressed your face to the fire 

like you re a nice 

juicy mutton chop. 

That give you some ideas  

Might do. 

Go ahead  then. 

You might get away. 

Might even make it 

there on your own. 

They re just over the river. 

The closest you ve 

been to family 

since Ilyn Payne 

snipped your daddy s neck. 

Someday I m gonna put 

a sword through your eye 

and out the back of your skull. 

How are we going 

to get past the Wall  

My uncle said 

it s  feet high. 

How did you get past it  

Got in a boat and rowed 

past the Bay of Seals. 

It would take us two months 

to get to the Bay of Seals. 

Some climb straight up the ice. 

Even Hodor s not strong enough to 

climb the Wall with me on his back. 

Hodor. 

 castles guard the Wall. 

  Only three are still manned. 

  Hodor  

One of those abandoned fortresses 

will give us a way through. 

My uncle said the gates were 

sealed with ice and stone 

when the castles were deserted. 

Well  we ll have 

to open them up again. 

  Whoa  whoa  whoa  

 i   There s a rider out there.  i  

Just one  

 i   There s more.  i  

  Hodor  

Shh. Shh. 

  It s just thunder  sweet giant. 

  Hodor. 

I yield. 

   i I yield.  i  

  Wildlings. 

Where s Shaggydog and Summer  

Hunting. 

Hodor  

  Shh  quiet  Hodor. 

  Hodor  

Make him shut up. 

If they hear us... 

  Hush  Hodor. No   no more Hodoring. 

  Hodor  

  Hodor  

  Hodor  calm down. 

  You need to keep quiet. 

  They re gonna hear us. 

 i Hodor  be quiet.  i  

  Ah  Hodor  

  Hodor  calm down. 

  Hodor  Hodor  

  Hodor  be quiet  

What did you do  

Nothing. 

I don t know. 

What s that  

That s a horse dying. 

 i Bring them over here.  i  

 i That was the last of them. 

The rest are dead.  i  

 i I heard shouting up there.  i  

Thunder. 

I know the difference 

between shouting and thunder. 

Maybe it s ghosts. 

That won t help you  grandpa. 

Where you riding  

Doesn t matter now  does it  

No  it doesn t matter now. 

Cut his throat or he ll 

tell the crows we re here. 

You understand. 

Let me stand at least. 

 i Let me go  i  

 i with a bit of dignity.  i  

Make the crow kill him. 

You re one of us now. 

Prove it. 

The wolves are out there. 

I can t do it by choice. 

I don t know how. 

It happens in my dreams. 

You re a warg  Bran. 

It s in your blood. 

I can t. 

You just did with him. 

A wolf is nothing 

compared to that. 

She looks sharp. 

Do it. 

Do it. 

I told you. 

He s still one of them. 

Go on  boy. 

Go on  

He s a crow. 

 i He ll always be a crow.  i  

And here s his crow wife 

guarding him. 

He ll stab us in the back 

first chance he gets. 

Kill him. 

  He s one of them. 

  No  

Do you hear me  

You re not gonna die 

for one of them. 

Do it. 

They ll find us if you don t. 

You were right the whole time. 

Hyah  

 i When you hear a 

songbird s whistle  you come.  i  

I m a great whistler. 

The greatest in the land. 

Daario Naharis. 

 i That one was quick.  i  

  There may be others. 

  I doubt it. 

The Yunkish prefer to let their 

slaves do their fighting for them. 

That s what you call 

a few guards  

Come on  

What do you got  huh  

Lord Edmure... 

I hope I m not 

a disappointment to you. 

You re a delight 

to me  my lady. 

You may now cloak the bride 

and bring her under 

your protection. 

In the sight of the Seven  

I hereby seal these two souls  

binding them as one 

for eternity. 

 i Look upon each other  i  

 i and say the words.  i  

Father  Smith  

Warrior  Mother  

Maiden  Crone  Stranger... 

  I am hers... 

  I am his... 

   i and she is mine...  i  

   i and he is mine...  i  

 i ...from this day  i  

 i until the end of my days.  i  

  Is that safe  

  They re long gone. 

You were right. 

I can get inside Summer s 

mind whenever I want. 

Of course you can. 

North of the Wall 

there are wildlings 

who can control 

all sorts of animals. 

 i But you did a lot  i  

 i more than that.  i  

You got inside Hodor s mind. 

They can t do that 

north of the Wall  

No one can do that... 

 i anywhere.  i  

When I was looking 

through Summer s eyes  

  I saw Jon. 

  Where  

He was with the wildlings. 

They tried to kill him  

but he got away. 

 i He ll be heading back 

to Castle Black  then.  i  

That s where we should go. 

For all we know  Castle 

Black s already under attack. 

  If this many wildlings got through   

  I already told you. 

I m not going 

north of the Wall. 

Everything Jojen 

told me is true. 

You saw what I did to Hodor. 

 i I have to find  i  

 i the three eyed raven.  i  

Listen to me  little lord. 

Don t worry. 

I m not asking you 

to come with me. 

It won t be safe for Rickon. 

Me  

I m coming with you. 

No. 

You and Osha and Shaggydog 

head for the Last Hearth. 

The Umbers are our bannermen. 

They ll protect you. 

I m coming with you. 

I m your brother. 

I have to protect you. 

Right now I have 

to protect you. 

Robb s at war and I m 

going beyond the Wall. 

If something happens to us  

you re the heir to Winterfell. 

Would you know how 

to find the Last Hearth  

You southerners build your big 

castles and you never move. 

You re easy to find. 

We re not southerners. 

And I don t want to leave you. 

Shh  shh. 

Come here  little soldier. 

You and me  we re gonna 

have some adventures. 

You don t have to do 

any of this. 

Your family took me in 

and was good to me when 

they had no cause to be. 

 i Shh.  i  

We ll be fine  you and me. 

The Umbers are great warriors. 

Even I heard 

about them growing up. 

They ll teach you 

how to swing a sword. 

I know how to swing a sword. 

You re leaving now  It s 

the middle of the night. 

I learned to walk in darkness. 

Say your good byes  

little man. 

Keep this one safe. 

He means the world to me. 

We ve been waiting a long time. 

Haven t we  

I don t know  you tell me. 

How long does it take 

to sack a city  

It was just as you said. 

They did not believe 

until it was too late. 

Their slave soldiers 

threw down their spears 

and surrendered. 

And Daario Naharis  

The city is yours  my queen. 

They re good  aren t they  

They ought to be 

because they cost enough. 

Look at the crowd there. 

He complained 

about this marriage 

the entire ride from Riverrun  

 i and now look at him.  i  

 i The gods 

love to reward a fool.  i  

  Uncle. 

  What  

He s my nephew. 

I love him. 

And he s a damned fool. 

Don t you drink  Lord Bolton  

Never do  my lady. 

Dulls the senses. 

That s the point. 

Didn t you marry 

one of these Frey girls  

Aye. 

Lord Walder let me choose 

any of his granddaughters 

and promised me the girl s 

weight in silver as a dowry. 

So I have a fat young bride. 

I hope she makes you 

very happy. 

Well  she s made me very rich. 

Pardon  my lord  my lady. 

I need to find 

a tree to piss on. 

My mother s alone 

with Roose Bolton. 

I should rescue her. 

Your mother is less 

in need of rescue 

than any woman I ve ever met. 

Be kind. 

She s finally starting 

to like you. 

And I like her. 

But if she had her way  

I would be back in Volantis 

playing my harp and you 

would be sitting over there 

 i eating blackberries  i  

 i out of Roslin Frey s hand.  i  

Perhaps I ve made 

a terrible mistake. 

Striking your king 

is an act of treason. 

No  don t. 

Don t insult them. 

Your Grace. 

The septon has prayed 

his prayers  

 i some words were said   i  

and Lord Edmure 

has wrapped my daughter 

in a cloak. 

But they are not yet 

man and wife. 

A sword needs a sheath. 

And a wedding needs a bedding. 

What does my sire say  

To bed  To bed  To bed  

If you think the time 

is right  Lord Walder  

by all means  let us bed them. 

To bed  To bed  To bed  

 i Go on   i  

Oh  

Careful now  ladies. 

Once you set that monster free  

there s no caging him again. 

To bed  To bed  To bed  

Poor girl. 

Every bride suffers the same. 

I m sure you endured 

yours with grace. 

Oh  Ned forbade it. 

He said it wouldn t be right if he broke 

a man s jaw on our wedding night. 

That is a very strange custom. 

I suppose it does seem strange 

from a foreigner s perspective. 

It seems normal to you  

It s a tradition. 

Without the bedding ceremony  

there s no real proof 

the lord and lady 

consummated their marriage. 

But there are other ways 

of providing proof. 

Boy or girl  

I don t know. 

But if it s a boy  I know 

what we should name him. 

Oh  do you  

It seems to me the father should 

have some say in his son s naming. 

Eddard. 

Don t you want to teach 

little Ned Stark 

how to ride horses  

I do. 

 i Go on  line  em up   i  

Whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa. 

Where are you going  

Got salt pork for the feast. 

The feast is over. 

 i Doesn t sound 

like it s over.  i  

If I tell you 

it s over  it s over. 

Turn this cart around 

and get the hell out of here. 

Got pig s feet  too. 

Are you soft in the head  

Turn this cart around. 

Your Grace. 

 i I feel I ve been remiss  i  

in my duties. 

 i I ve given you meat  i  

 i and wine and music   i  

 i but I haven t shown you  i  

 i the hospitality you deserve.  i  

 i My king has married  i  

 i and I owe my new queen  i  

 i a wedding gift.  i  

Robb  

You ready to 

head home to Winterfell  right  

 i Feast over yet  is it   i  

Aye  it s over. 

Follow him. 

 i Aim   i  

It s too late. 

The King in the North arises. 

Lord Walder  

Lord Walder  enough  

Let it end  

Please. 

He is my son. 

 i My first son.  i  

Let him go and I swear 

that we will forget this. 

I swear it by 

the old gods and new. 

We will take no vengeance. 

You already swore me one oath 

right here in my castle. 

You swore by all the gods your 

son would marry my daughter  

 i Take me for a 

hostage  but let Robb go.  i  

Robb  get up. 

Get up and walk out. 

Please  

Please  

And why would I 

let him do that  

On my honor as a Tully  

on my honor as a Stark  

let him go 

or I will cut 

your wife s throat. 

I ll find another. 

Mother. 

The Lannisters send 

their regards. 

You will release 

every slave in Yunkai. 

Reject this gift and I shall 

show you no mercy. 

  You are mad. 

  It was just as you said. 

Their slave soldiers threw down 

their spears and surrendered. 

 i   The bitch stays.  i  

  I m taking her to King s Landing. 

Unless you kill me. 

Well  we must be on our way. 

  Please. 

  I m not killing you. 

Just making a few 

alterations. 

No  Don t  

The Nightfort s closest 

to Castle Black. 

It s got a secret 

sally port  

the Black Gate  

as old as the Wall itself. 

It leads through the Wall 

right down into the Nightfort. 

  Stop. 

  But your father   

I won t share your bed. 

Not until you want me to. 

What if I never 

want you to  

And so my watch begins. 

He s a crow. He ll stab us in 

the back first chance he gets. 

Kill him. 

The wolves are out there. 

You re a warg  Bran. 

 i Do it.  i  

I m going beyond the Wall. 

It won t be safe for Rickon. 

I m coming with you. 

You and Osha and Shaggydog 

head for the Last Hearth. 

  She s going to kill him. 

  Sacrifice him. 

 i The boy is your nephew.  i  

The usurper Robb Stark. 

 i She says there s power  i  

 i in king s blood.  i  

Got salt pork 

for the feast. 

The feast is over. 

Robb  

Mother. 

The Lannisters send their regards. 

It s too late.

Ser Eldrick Sarsfield

Ser Eldrick Sarsfield 

and Lord Desmond Crakehall. 

What are you doing  

I have a list. 

A list of people 

you mean to kill  

For laughing at me  

Do I look like 

Joffrey to you  

No  death seems 

a bit extreme. 

Fear of death  

on the other hand... 

You should learn 

to ignore them. 

My lady  people have 

been laughing at me 

far longer than they ve 

been laughing at you. 

I m the Halfman  

the Demon Monkey  

the Imp. 

You re a Lannister. 

I am the disgraced daughter 

of the traitor Ned Stark. 

The disgraced daughter 

and the Demon Monkey. 

We re perfect for each other. 

So how should 

we punish them  

Who  Whom  

Ser Eldrick Sarsfield 

and Lord Desmond Crakehall. 

Ah. 

I could speak to Lord Varys 

and learn their perversions. 

Anyone named Desmond 

Crakehall must be a pervert. 

I hear that 

you re a pervert. 

I am the Imp. 

I have certain standards 

to maintain. 

We could sheep shift 

Lord Desmond s bed. 

You cut a little hole 

in his mattress 

and you stuff 

sheep dung inside. 

Then you sew up the hole 

and make his bed again. 

His room will stink  but he won t 

know where it s coming from. 

Lady Sansa  

My sister used to do that 

when she was angry with me. 

And she was always 

angry with me. 

Why sheep  i shift   i  

That s the vulgar word 

for dung. 

My lady... 

Well  you asked me. 

Oh  

That s him  

My lord  my lady. 

Your father has called 

a meeting of the small council. 

Killed a few 

puppies today  

Show him. 

Come on  show him. 

Oh  apologies  my lord. 

Old fingers. 

 Roslin caught 

a fine fat trout. 

 i Her brothers gave her  i  

 i a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.  i  

 i Signed Walder Frey.   i  

Is that bad poetry 

or is it supposed 

to mean something  

Robb Stark is dead. 

 i And his bitch mother.  i  

Write back to Lord Frey. 

 i Thank him for his service  i  

 i and command him  i  

to send Robb Stark s head. 

I m going to serve it to Sansa 

at my wedding feast. 

Your Grace  Lady Sansa 

is your aunt by marriage. 

A joke. 

Joffrey did not mean it. 

Yes  I did. 

I m going to have it served 

to Sansa at my wedding feast. 

 i No.  i  

She is no longer 

yours to torment. 

Everyone is mine 

to torment. 

You d do well to remember that  

you little monster. 

Oh  I m a monster. 

Perhaps you should speak 

to me more softly  then. 

 i Monsters are dangerous  i  

and just now kings 

are dying like flies. 

I could have 

your tongue out 

 i for saying that.  i  

Let him make his threats. 

Hmm  He s a bitter 

little man. 

Lord Tyrion should 

apologize immediately. 

Unacceptable  

disrespectful  

 i and in very bad taste.  i  

I am the king  

I will punish you. 

Any man who must say  

 I am the king  

is no true king. 

I ll make sure 

you understand that 

when I ve won 

your war for you. 

My father won 

the real war. 

He killed Prince Rhaegar. 

He took the crown 

while you hid 

under Casterly Rock  

The king is tired. 

See him to his chambers. 

  Come along. 

  I m not tired. 

We have so much 

to celebrate. 

A wedding to plan. 

You must rest. 

Grand Maester  perhaps 

some essence of nightshade 

to help him sleep. 

I m not tired  

Come. 

Not you. 

You just sent the most 

powerful man in Westeros 

to bed without his supper. 

You re a fool if you believe he s 

the most powerful man in Westeros. 

A treasonous statement. 

Joffrey is king. 

You really think a crown 

gives you power  

No. 

I think armies 

give you power. 

  Mm hmm. 

  Robb Stark had one  

never lost a battle  

and you defeated him 

all the same. 

  Mm hmm. 

  Oh  I know. 

Walder Frey 

gets all the credit. 

Or the blame  

I suppose  

depending on 

your allegiance. 

 i Walder Frey  i  

 i is many things   i  

but a brave man  

No. 

He never would have 

risked such an action 

if he didn t have 

certain assurances. 

Which he got from me. 

Do you disapprove  

 i I m all for cheating.  i  

 i This is war.  i  

But to slaughter them 

at a wedding... 

Explain to me 

why it is more noble 

to kill   men 

in battle 

than a dozen at dinner. 

So that s why you did it  

To save lives  

To end the war. 

To protect the family. 

 i Do you want to write a song  i  

 i for the dead Starks   i  

Go ahead  write one. 

 i I m in this world  i  

 i a little while longer  i  

to defend the Lannisters  

to defend my blood. 

The northerners 

will never forget. 

Good. 

Let them remember 

what happens 

when they march 

on the south. 

All the Stark men 

are dead. 

Winterfell is a ruin. 

Roose Bolton will be named 

Warden of the North 

until your son by Sansa 

comes of age. 

I believe you still have some 

work to do on that score. 

Do you think she ll open 

her legs for me 

after I tell her how we murdered 

her mother and brother  

One way or another  

you will get that girl pregnant. 

I will not rape her. 

Shall I explain to you in one 

easy lesson how the world works  

Use small words. 

I m not as bright as you. 

The house that puts family 

first will always defeat 

the house that puts 

the whims and wishes 

 i of its sons  i  

 i and daughters first.  i  

A good man does 

everything in his power 

to better 

his family s position 

regardless of his own 

selfish desires. 

Does that amuse you  

No  it s a very 

good lesson. 

Only it s easy for you to 

preach utter devotion to family 

when you re making 

all the decisions. 

Easy for me  is it  

When have you ever done something 

that wasn t in your interest 

but solely for the benefit 

of the family  

The day 

that you were born. 

I wanted to carry you 

into the sea 

and let the waves 

wash you away. 

Instead  I let you live. 

And I brought you up 

as my son. 

Because you re a Lannister. 

Sansa. 

It s empty. 

Let s find 

a place to sleep. 

Hodor. 

Hodor. 

Don t  Hodor. 

Maybe we shouldn t 

stay here. 

You d rather 

be out there  

There are a lot of stories 

about this place. 

Horrible stories. 

I always quite liked 

the horrible stories. 

So did I. 

Once. 

You ever heard 

about the Rat Cook  

No. 

Who s he  

Just a cook 

in the Night s Watch. 

He was angry at the king 

for something  

I don t remember. 

When the king was visiting 

the Nightfort  

the cook killed 

the king s son  

cooked him 

into a big pie 

with onions  carrots  

mushrooms and bacon. 

That night he served 

the pie to the king. 

He liked the taste 

of his son so much  

he asked for 

a second slice. 

The gods turned the cook 

into a giant white rat 

 i who could only eat  i  

 i his own young.  i  

 i He s been roaming  i  

 i the Nightfort ever since   i  

 i devouring his own babies.  i  

But no matter 

what he does  

he s always hungry. 

If the gods turned 

every killer 

into a giant white rat   

It wasn t for murder 

the gods cursed the Rat Cook 

 i or for serving  i  

 i the king s son in a pie.  i  

He killed a guest 

beneath his roof. 

That s something 

the gods can t forgive. 

 The late Walder Frey   

old Tully called me 

because I didn t get my men to 

the Trident in time for battle. 

 i He thought he was witty.  i  

 i Look at us now  Tully.  i  

 i You re dead   i  

 i your daughter s dead   i  

your grandson s dead  

your son spent his wedding 

night in a dungeon 

and I m Lord 

of Riverrun. 

The Blackfish escaped. 

An old man on the run 

 i with no allies.  i  

I have Tywin Lannister 

backing me. 

  Who does he have  

  As you say. 

 i They all laughed at me   i  

all those high lords. 

They all thought 

they were better than me. 

Ned Stark  

Hoster Tully. 

People snigger 

when I marry a young girl  

but who said a word when Jon Arryn 

married the little Tully bitch  

You ll be needing 

a new young girl. 

Yeah. 

Got that 

to look forward to. 

 i And you   i  

the Warden 

of the North. 

 i No more Starks  i  

 i to bow and scrape to.  i  

Must have been torture 

following that stupid boy 

all over the country. 

He ignored my advice 

at every turn. 

If he d been a trifle 

less arrogant... 

Calling himself 

the Young Wolf. 

How s that for pomposity  

Well  here s to 

the Young Wolf  

Forever young. 

Will you move to Winterfell 

now that the war s over  

At some point perhaps. 

But Winterfell s in ruins. 

Yeah. 

What happened up there  

I heard the Greyjoy boy 

seized the place. 

I heard he killed 

all the ravens. 

And after that  nothing. 

I sent my bastard Ramsay 

to root him out. 

Robb Stark offered 

amnesty for the ironborn 

if they gave us Theon. 

Oh. And  

 i Ramsay delivered  i  

 i the terms.  i  

The ironborn turned on Theon 

as we knew they would. 

 i They handed him over  i  

 i trussed and hooded.  i  

 i But Ramsay   well...  i  

 i Ramsay has his own way  i  

 i of doing things.  i  

Well  the girls 

weren t lying. 

You had 

a good sized cock. 

What  

No. 

Pork sausage. 

You think I m some 

sort of savage  

People talk about 

phantom limbs. 

 i An amputee might have an itch  i  

 i where his foot used to be.  i  

 i So I ve always wondered...  i  

do eunuchs 

have a phantom cock  

 i Next time you think  i  

 i about naked girls   i  

would you feel an itch  

Sorry. 

I shouldn t make jokes. 

My mother taught me not 

to throw stones at cripples. 

But my father taught me 

to aim for their head. 

Kill me. 

Sorry  what  

Kill me. 

A little louder. 

Kill me  

You re no good 

to me dead. 

We need you. 

You don t look like 

a Theon Greyjoy anymore. 

That s a name 

for a lord. 

But you re not a lord  

are you  

You re just meat. 

Stinking meat. 

You reek. 

Reek  

That s a good name 

for you. 

What s your name  

Theon Greyjoy. 

What s your name  

Th   

Theon Greyjoy. 

Please. 

What is your name   

Reek. 

My name is... 

Reek. 

Hodor. 

  Don t kill me  

  Who are you  

  Sam  Sam  

  Who are you   

Gilly. 

Don t hurt us. 

Where are you going  

To Castle Black. I m a brother 

of the Night s Watch. 

  My brother  he s in the Night s   

  Shush. 

  Who s your brother  

  Doesn t matter. 

You re Jon s brother. 

 i The one who fell  i  

 i from the window.  i  

No  I m not. 

I ve been around Ghost enough to 

know a direwolf when I see one. 

And I ve heard 

all about Hodor. 

Hodor. 

I d be dead 

if it wasn t for Jon. 

If you re his brother  

you re my brother  too. 

And anything I can do 

to help you  I will. 

Take us north 

of the Wall. 

What  

Why in the world 

would you want to go   

I don t want to. 

I have to. 

How did you get 

through the Wall  

Does the well lead to an underground river  

Is that how you came here  

Come with us. 

There are steps carved into 

the south side of the Wall. 

Hodor can carry you 

to the top. 

We ll walk straight 

to Castle Black. 

Come with us. 

There s nothing north but death. 

 i If Jon is alive   i  

 i then Castle Black s  i  

 i where he ll be.  i  

It s the safest place 

for you. 

There s nowhere safe any longer. 

You know that. 

What I know 

is what I saw. 

And if you saw it  too  

you d run the other way. 

You saw the white walkers 

and the army of the dead. 

How do you know 

all that  

The Night s Watch 

can t stop them. 

The kings of Westeros and all 

their armies can t stop them. 

But you re going 

to stop them  

Please  Sam. 

 i I have to go north.  i  

I have to. 

 Balon Greyjoy  

Lord of the Iron Islands 

and invader of the North. 

I give you 

until the full moon 

to order all ironborn scum 

out of the North 

 i and back to those  i  

 i shit stained rocks  i  

 i you call a home.  i  

 i On the first night  i  

 i of the full moon   i  

 i I will hunt down  i  

 i every islander  i  

still in our lands 

and flay them living 

the way I flayed 

the  ironborn scum 

I found at Winterfell. 

 i In the box you ll find  i  

 i a special gift    i  

Theon s favorite toy. 

He cried when I took it 

away from him. 

Leave the North now 

or more boxes will follow 

with more Theon. 

Signed Ramsay Snow  

natural born son 

of Roose Bolton  

Lord of the Dreadfort 

and Warden of the North.  

Get that 

out of my sight. 

Theon disobeyed 

my orders. 

The boy is a fool. 

He cannot further 

the Greyjoy line. 

I will not give up 

the lands I have seized  

the strongholds 

I have taken. 

Get this away from me. 

He s your son. 

Son  

He s not 

a man anymore. 

He s your son. 

He s my brother. 

He s a Greyjoy. 

Watch yourself. 

I ve made 

my decision. 

And I ve made mine. 

I m going to pick the 

fastest ship in our fleet. 

 i I m going to choose  i  

 i the  best killers on the Iron Islands.  i  

Get those ropes  

 i I m going to sail  i  

 i up the Narrow Sea  i  

 i all the way  i  

 i to the Weeping Water.  i  

 i I m going to march  i  

 i on the Dreadfort.  i  

 i I m going to find  i  

 i my little brother  i  

 i and I m going  i  

 i to bring him home.  i  

What is it  

Dragonglass. 

We found them 

at the Fist. 

Someone buried them 

a long time ago. 

Someone wanted us 

to find them. 

Why  

What are they for  

Killing white walkers. 

How do you know that  

 i The walker came  i  

 i for my baby.  i  

And Sam... 

But no one s killed a white 

walker in thousands of years. 

Well  I suppose someone 

had to be the first. 

Take it  Hodor. 

And the archer. 

I got lucky 

with one of them. 

There are more. 

 i Many more.  i  

And for every one of them  

the dead men  

more than you 

could count. 

I wish you d come 

with us. 

I wish I could. 

I really do. 

How are you keeping  

Great. 

Never better. 

It was just 

a bit of blood. 

I should have known. 

Every time a highborn 

asks my name  it s trouble. 

We re not really people 

to you  are we  

Just a million different ways 

to get what you want. 

  I m not a highborn. 

  She called you Ser. 

I heard it. 

A recent state 

of affairs. 

I was born in Flea Bottom 

just like you. 

Sure  you were. 

You re my friend. 

You re here to help. 

I lived below 

the Street of Flour. 

 i How far below   i  

How close to the 

Red Keep were you  

The shit that poured 

from their privy pipes 

 i flowed down the side  i  

 i of Aegon s Hill  i  

along Tanner s Row and right 

in front of my front door 

  on Gin Alley. 

  Gin Alley. 

The Street of Steel  

with your armor and your knights  

Pfft. 

You lived in the fancy 

part of town. 

And here we are now. 

Two boys from Flea Bottom 

in the castle of a king. 

Yeah  we ve come 

a long way. 

We re all 

the same  really. 

She went to great pains 

to point that out to me. 

If you mistrust 

fancy people so much  

why were you in such a 

hurry to trust her  

You re me. 

Never been with a woman. 

 i Never talked  i  

 i to a woman  really.  i  

 i And then she  i  

 i comes at you    i  

big words  no clothes. 

What would you have done  

She does know her way around a 

man s head  I ll give her that. 

So how d you 

become a lord  

Oh  that s a long story. 

Better not  then. 

I m a bit busy. 

Many years ago 

I helped King Stannis 

out of a difficult 

situation. 

He rewarded me 

with a lordship. 

And this. 

You see  

Highborns. 

I didn t want 

to be a lord. 

I nearly didn t accept. 

Why did you  

I did it for my son. 

I didn t want him to step 

over a river of shit 

every time he stepped 

through his front door. 

I wanted him to have 

a better life. 

Does he  

He s dead. 

How d he die  

Following me. 

When did you come 

to this strange country  

When I was . 

You were only a child. 

I stopped being a child 

when I was nine. 

My mother 

made sure of that. 

You ve been 

a good influence 

on our mutual friend  

you know. 

He used to drink 

from sundown to sunup  

visit three brothels 

a night  

gamble away 

his father s money. 

Now it s just 

the drinking. 

And now 

I m his wife s servant. 

I brush her hair 

and clip her nails 

and empty 

her chamber pot. 

She is a sweet 

young thing. 

None of this 

is her fault. 

I love that girl. 

I would kill for her. 

Do you think that 

makes it easier for me  

No  I expect not. 

She s young and she s 

beautiful and highborn. 

We break bread 

with them  

but that doesn t 

make us family. 

We ve learned 

their language  

but we ll never be 

their countrymen. 

If you let yourself believe 

that a foreign girl 

with no name 

could spend her life with 

the son of Tywin Lannister   

  I have a name. 

  You have one name. 

As do I. 

Here only the family 

name matters. 

What do you want 

from me  Lord Varys  

Diamonds. 

I d tell you to beware 

carrying so much wealth  

but you know how 

to protect yourself. 

Get on one 

of those ships. 

Sail to Pentos 

or Lys or Myr. 

You can buy a house 

with these diamonds  

a very large house. 

Hire servants. 

Start a new life  

a good life  

far from here. 

The mysterious 

foreign beauty. 

You ll have suitors 

lining up. 

Why do you 

want me to leave  

Tyrion Lannister is one 

of the few people alive 

who could make this country 

a better place. 

He has the mind for it  

he has the will  

he has the right 

last name. 

And you   

you are a complication. 

I know you love him. 

And I know it s true love not 

bought by gold and silver. 

I m not asking you 

to leave him for money. 

I m asking you to leave 

because your presence 

in the capital 

endangers him. 

This will never 

be your home  my lady. 

Find a true home 

somewhere far from here... 

while there s still time. 

Lord Varys. 

If he wants me to leave  

he can tell me himself. 

Keep up. 

I don t think 

I can  my lord. 

It s not easy 

being drunk all the time. 

Everyone would do it 

if it were easy. 

Leave. 

So  enjoying 

married life  

An unhappy wife is a wine 

merchant s best friend. 

She doesn t 

deserve this. 

Deserve  

Be careful with that. 

Start trying to work out 

who deserves what 

and before long you ll spend 

the rest of your days 

weeping for each and every 

person in the world. 

There s nothing worse 

than a late blooming philosopher. 

Will you be facing 

your marriage to Ser Loras 

with the same 

philosophical spirit  

I won t be marrying 

Ser Loras. 

I seem to remember 

saying something similar 

about my own marriage. 

You re not me. 

You want to make things 

better for Sansa  

Give her a child. 

So you can tell Father 

it was you 

who finally 

talked me into it  

So she can have 

some happiness in her life. 

You have children. 

How happy would 

you say you are  

Not very. 

But if it weren t 

for my children  

I d have thrown myself from the 

highest window in the Red Keep. 

They re the reason 

I m alive. 

Even Joffrey  

Even Joffrey. 

He was all I had once. 

Before Myrcella was born. 

I used to spend hours 

looking at him. 

His wisps of hair. 

His tiny little 

hands and feet. 

He was such 

a jolly little fellow. 

You always hear the terrible 

ones were terrible babies. 

 We should have known. 

Even then we should have known.  

It s nonsense. 

Whenever he was with me  

he was happy. 

And no one can take that 

away from me  

not even Joffrey   

how it feels 

to have someone. 

Someone of your own. 

How long 

does it go on  

Until we ve dealt 

with all our enemies. 

Every time we deal 

with an enemy  

we create two more. 

Then I suppose it will go 

on for quite a long time. 

I m telling you  

that s what she did. 

 i Sounded like  i  

 i a cow in heat.  i  

  Aye  not for long. 

  That s right. 

Black Walder 

shut her up right quick. 

 i None of the Starks had much to 

say about the end of that meal.  i  

I ll tell you what  

though. 

The hardest thing was getting that 

wolf s head to stay on the body. 

  You sewed it on  

  I did. 

I bet there were   men 

claiming they were the one. 

It was me. 

And Malcolm 

and Talbott. 

Well  the thing was so heavy  

it fell off the first time. 

Took the skin 

right with it. 

 i What we ended up having to do  i  

 i was hook the needle  i  

 i right under  i  

 i the collarbone.  i  

Give it a nice 

firm mooring and   

What do you want  

  Mind if I keep warm  

  Fuck off. 

But I m hungry. 

Does fuck off mean something 

different where you re from  

I ve got money. 

What kind of coin 

is that  

It s worth a lot. 

Sorry. 

Little shit. 

 i Fool   i  

Where did you 

get the knife  

From you. 

 i Is that the first man  i  

 i you ve killed   i  

The first man. 

Next time you re going 

to do something like that  

tell me first. 

Valar morghulis. 

Ygritte  you know 

I didn t have a choice. 

You always knew who I was  

what I am. 

I have to go home now. 

I know you won t hurt me. 

You know nothing  

Jon Snow. 

I do know some things. 

I know I love you. 

 i I know you love me.  i  

But I have 

to go home now. 

I know how 

this must look. 

  What I meant was   

  I swear to you  my lord   

I m not a lord  my dear. 

Not for many  many years. 

 i Every man who joins  i  

 i the Night s Watch  i  

renounces 

all former titles. 

Among other things. 

What is your name  

Gilly. 

Ah  for the gillyflower. 

Lovely. 

Yes  my   

Maester. 

Master. 

Maester. 

And the child  

She hasn t chosen 

a name yet. 

His name is Sam. 

Tarly... 

do you remember 

the oath you swore 

when you joined 

this order  

He s not my child  

Maester Aemon. 

She s one 

of Craster s wives. 

I remember every word 

of the oath. 

Night gathers 

and my watch begins. 

 i I am the shield that guards  i  

 i the realms of men.  i  

The realms of men. 

That means her 

as well as us. 

We didn t build 

 miles of ice walls 

 feet high 

to keep out men. 

The night is gathering  

Maester Aemon. 

I ve seen it. 

It s coming 

for all of us. 

Gilly  you and your son 

will be our guests 

for the time being. 

We certainly cannot 

send you back 

beyond the Wall. 

Thank you... 

Maester. 

I can cook and clean 

and I can   

Good. 

Samwell  fetch a quill 

and inkwell. 

I hope your penmanship is 

better than your swordplay. 

Miles better. 

We had  ravens 

at last count. 

Make sure 

they re all fed. 

Every one of them 

flies tonight. 

 To His Grace 

King Stannis Baratheon. 

Invaded   inv   

invit   invited 

to the name day 

celebration 

for Rylene Florent 

on the first nigit    

Night. 

 First night 

of the full moon.  

Why is there 

a G in night  

I don t know. 

There just is. 

Well  your father s 

not going to go to that. 

My books are better 

than these boring scrolls. 

You could read about 

Balerion the Dread. 

They say you can still see his skull 

in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. 

I d like to see 

that someday. 

I ve been trying to stay out of 

those dungeons my whole life. 

 His fangs were as long 

as bastard swords.  

Aye  old Balerion s 

definitely better 

than anything your cousin 

Rylene s got on offer. 

But now that I m your 

father s Hand again  

I have to keep 

him informed. 

The king does not have 

time for this drudgery. 

 To all the lords 

and knobble men of Westeros.  

  Noblemen. 

   i  Noblemen of Westeros   i  

the Nig   

the Night s Watch... 

implores...  

What is it  

Why are they 

ringing the bells  

 i Are we being attacked   i  

Stay here. 

Bar the door. 

The usurper 

Robb Stark is dead. 

Betrayed by his bannerman. 

And you take credit because you 

dropped a leech into the fire  

I take no credit. 

 i I have faith and my faith  i  

 i has been rewarded.  i  

Your Grace  the world 

has got so far bent. 

I ve seen things 

crawl out of nightmares  

but my eyes were open. 

I don t know if Robb Stark died 

because of the Red Woman s sorcery 

or because at war 

men die all the time  

but I do know that uniting 

the Seven Kingdoms 

with blood magic is wrong. 

It is evil. 

And you are not 

an evil man. 

Do you know who had this table 

carved and painted  Ser Davos  

Aegon Targaryen. 

And do you know how Aegon 

Targaryen conquered Westeros  

On the back of his dragon 

Balerion the Dread. 

He had a smaller fleet 

than the kings he faced 

and a smaller army  

but he had three dragons. 

Dragons are magic  

Ser Davos. 

My enemies have made 

my kingdom bleed. 

 i I will not forget that.  i  

I will not forgive that. 

I will punish them 

with any arms 

at my disposal. 

You do not need 

to burn the boy. 

 i If what you say is true   i  

a drop of his blood 

killed Robb Stark   

And our king is still 

no closer to the Iron Throne. 

A great gift requires 

a great sacrifice. 

His name is Gendry. 

He s a good lad. 

A poor lad 

from Flea Bottom 

who happens 

to be your nephew. 

What is the life of one bastard 

boy against a kingdom  

Everything. 

The boy must die. 

  What are you doing  

  You re leaving. 

Is this some kind 

of trick  

Yes  but not on you. 

Aim for that star. 

Don t stop. 

There s bread and water. 

Go slow with it. 

If you finish it off  

no matter how 

thirsty you get  

don t drink seawater. 

I know not 

to drink seawater. 

Row for a full day and night 

and you ll reach Rook s Rest. 

You ll want to stop there. 

Don t. She ll find you. 

Where should I go  

You must keep the coast 

on your left side 

until you reach 

King s Landing. 

The gold cloaks 

are looking for me. 

They were looking 

for me for  years. 

  Do they know your face  

  No. 

I d worry more 

about the Red Woman. 

The other way. 

You ever been 

in a boat before  

No. 

You know how to swim  

No. 

Don t fall out. 

Go on. 

Why are you doing this  

 i Because it s right.  i  

And because 

I m a slow learner. 

When you get to Flea Bottom  

have a bowl of brown for me. 

 i Horse approaching   i  

Halt  Halt  

Jon  Jon  

 i Jon  it s us.  i  

I don t think 

he can see us. 

Pyp  

Sam  

Hush  now. 

You re home. 

Carry him inside. 

Gently. 

Out of the way. 

Step aside  

country boy. 

People working here. 

Cersei. 

You don t deny it  

No. 

I let him go. 

Your mercy 

saved the boy s life. 

You feel good 

about that  

Aye  I do. 

 i You saved one innocent.  i  

How many tens of thousands 

have you doomed  

There has got 

to be another way. 

What other way   

Tell us about 

this other way. 

I don t know  

Your Grace. 

I can t see the future 

in the fire. 

Very well  

Ser Davos Seaworth. 

I  Stannis 

of the House Baratheon  

First of My Name  Rightful King 

of the Andals and the First Men  

  sentence you to die. 

  I understand. 

But since you haven t yet 

unnamed me Hand of the King  

it is my duty 

to advise you against it. 

  You re gonna need me. 

  Take him away. 

Why am I gonna need you  

My king. 

 i It s from Maester Aemon  i  

 i of the Night s Watch.  i  

 i Their Lord Commander  i  

 i is dead.  i  

 i Took a ranging party north  i  

 i and never made it back.  i  

One lad did  though. 

What he saw 

beyond the Wall   

it s coming 

for all of us. 

When did you 

learn to read  

Matthos taught me 

before he died 

so I could be 

of better service to you. 

This War of Five Kings 

means nothing. 

 i The true war lies  i  

 i to the north  my king.  i  

Death marches on the Wall. 

Only you can stop him. 

You can t stop him alone. 

You need someone to rebuild 

your army for you  

someone to convince this lord 

and that lord to fight for you  

to bring sellswords 

and pirates to your side. 

I ve made my decision. 

He s right. 

You need him. 

He has a part to play 

in the war to come. 

You see  Ser Davos  

You ve been saved 

by that fire god you like to mock. 

You re in his army now. 

They will come  

Your Grace. 

When they re ready. 

Perhaps they didn t 

want to be conquered. 

You didn t conquer them. 

You liberated them. 

People learn to love 

their chains. 

No. 

  Mhysa  

  Mhysa  

Mhysa  Mhysa  

Mhysa  Mhysa  Mhysa  

What does it mean  

It is old Ghiscari  

khaleesi. 

It means  mother.  

It s all right. 

These people 

won t hurt me. 

Mhysa  Mhysa  

Mhysa. 

Mhysa  Mhysa  Mhysa  

Clegane  look into the flames. 

What do you see  

A wall of ice. 

The Wall. 

The only thing standing 

between us 

and the army of the dead 

is the Wall  

and the Wall hasn t been 

properly manned in centuries. 

Last time we saw The Night King  

it was at Hardhome. 

Closest castle to Hardhome 

is Eastwatch by the sea. 

And that s where I ll go. 

Looks like we re 

the Nightswatch now. 

This suits you  Lady Stark. 

  Jon left you in charge  

  He did. 

  Lord Tarly. 

  I believe you know my son. 

Do you fight with us... 

or with the foreign savages 

and eunuchs  

What do you think I should do  

If you use them to melt castles 

and burn cities  

you re not different. 

You re just more of the same. 

Listen. 

You could ve killed me. 

The fuck were you doing 

back there  

Ending the war. 

Killing her. 

You saw the dragon 

between you and her  

And  

Listen to me  cunt. 

Till I get what I m owed  

a dragon doesn t 

get to kill you  

you don t get to kill you  

only I get to kill you. 

That was only one of them. 

She has two more. 

If she decides to use them  

to really use them... 

  You re fucked. 

  Don t you mean we re fucked  

No  I do not. 

Dragons are where 

our partnership ends. 

I m not gonna be around 

when those things 

start spitting fire 

on King s Landing. 

I have to tell Cersei. 

May as well jump 

back in that river. 

I know what Cersei has told you. 

That I ve come 

to destroy your cities  

burn down your homes  

murder you  

and orphan your children. 

That s Cersei Lannister  not me. 

I m not here to murder  

and all I want to destroy 

is the wheel that has 

rolled over rich and poor 

to the benefit of no one but the 

Cersei Lannisters of the world. 

I offer you a choice   

bend the knee and join me. 

Together  we will leave the world 

a better place than we found it. 

Or refuse... 

and die. 

Step forward  my lord. 

You will not kneel  

I already have a queen. 

My sister. 

She wasn t your queen 

until recently  though  was she  

When she murdered 

your rightful queen 

and destroyed House Tyrell 

for all time. 

So it appears your allegiances 

are somewhat flexible. 

There are 

no easy choices in war. 

Say what you will 

about your sister  

she was born in Westeros. 

She s lived here all her life. 

You  on the other hand  

murdered your own father 

and chose to support 

a foreign invader. 

One with no ties to this land... 

with an army of savages 

at her back. 

You will not trade 

your honor for your life. 

I respect that. 

Perhaps he could take 

the Black  Your Grace. 

Whatever else he is  

he is a true soldier. 

He d be invaluable at the Wall. 

You cannot send me to the Wall. 

You are not my queen. 

You will have to kill me  too. 

Step back and shut your mouth. 

Who are you  

A stupid boy. 

I am Dickon Tarly  

son of Randyll Tarly. 

You are the future 

of your house. 

This war has already wiped one 

great house from the world. 

Don t let it happen again. 

Bend the knee. 

I will not. 

Your Grace  nothing scrubs 

bold notions from a man s head 

like a few weeks in a dark cell. 

I meant what I said. 

I m not here 

to put men in chains. 

If that becomes an option  

many will take it. 

I gave them a choice. 

They made it. 

Your Grace  if you start 

beheading entire families   

I m not beheading anyone. 

Your Grace. 

Lord Randyll 

Tarly  Dickon Tarly  

I  Daenerys of House 

Targaryen  First of My Name  

Breaker of Chains  

and Mother of Dragons  

sentence you to die. 

Dracarys. 

My   my lord... 

How many men did we lose  

We haven t done 

a full accounting. 

It s not only armies 

that win wars. 

We have the Tyrell gold  we 

have the Iron Bank behind us. 

We can buy mercenaries. 

Not the same as our men  

but they ll fight 

if they re well paid  

which they will be. 

I just saw the Dothraki fight. 

They ll beat any mercenary army. 

They ll beat any army 

I ve ever seen. 

Killing our men wasn t war 

for them  it was sport. 

Her dragon burnt 

a thousand wagons. 

Qyburn s scorpion fired 

bolts bigger than you. 

They couldn t stop it. 

And she has three of them. 

This isn t a war we can win. 

So  what do we do  

Sue for peace  

I sit on her father s throne  

the father you betrayed 

and murdered. 

And in her mind  she s winning. 

What sort of offer 

do you think she d make  

Maybe we can count on Tyrion 

to intercede on our behalf 

by way of apology for 

murdering our father and son. 

He didn t. 

You saw the crossbow  

you saw his body. 

I m not talking about Father. 

Tyrion didn t kill Joffrey. 

He had nothing to do with it. 

  After all this time  it still amazes me that you   

  It was Olenna. 

She confessed before she died. 

And this was before or after 

she drank the poison 

you so kindly provided her  

After. 

And you believed her  

If you were Olenna  

would you rather have seen 

your granddaughter married 

to Joffrey or Tommen  

Which one would Margaery have 

been better able to control  

Which one would have made Olenna 

the true ruler 

of the Seven Kingdoms  

She was telling the truth. 

I shouldn t have 

listened to you. 

She should have died screaming. 

She s dead  like her son  

her grandchildren  

her whole house. 

And if we don t find a way out 

of this war  we ll follow them. 

So we fight and die 

or we submit and die. 

I know my choice. 

A soldier should know his. 

They re beautiful  aren t they  

It wasn t the word 

I was thinking of  but... 

but  yes  they are. 

Gorgeous beasts. 

They re not beasts to me. 

No matter how big they get 

or how terrifying 

to everyone else  

they re my children. 

You weren t gone long. 

No. 

And  

And I have fewer enemies 

today than I did yesterday. 

You re not sure 

how you feel about that. 

No  I m not. 

How many men did your army kill 

taking Winterfell back 

from the Boltons  

Thousands. 

We both want to help people. 

We can only help them 

from a position of strength. 

Sometimes strength is terrible. 

When you first came here  

Ser Davos said you took a knife 

in the heart for your people. 

Ser Davos gets carried away. 

So  it was a figure of speech  

Your Grace. 

Jon Snow  this is 

Ser Jorah Mormont  

an old friend. 

I served with your father. 

He was a great man. 

You look strong. 

You found a cure  

I wouldn t be here if I hadn t. 

I return to your 

service  my queen  

if you ll have me. 

It would be my honor. 

Ravens. 

We need to send ravens. 

I put very little stock 

in it myself. 

Prophecies of doom 

are never in short supply  

especially when winter comes. 

I remember Wolkan. 

A little timid  

but a sharp mind. 

Eh  the North has dulled 

many good maesters  wits. 

Hard to say whether 

it s the cold  the drink  

or the company. 

A crippled boy 

claims to have seen 

dead men on the march 

beyond the Wall  

thanks to the magical help 

of a raven with three eyes  

Yes  it is a bit much. 

  Still  we ought to write back   

  Brandon Stark. 

  The crippled boy. 

  Do you know him  

I led him through 

the Wall years ago. 

I saw him go beyond the Wall. 

And  

Somehow  a crippled boy 

survived for years beyond the 

Wall when no one else could. 

Not the Night s Watch  

not the wildlings  no one. 

Perhaps we ought to listen 

to what he has to say. 

Perhaps you need more scribing 

work to discipline your mind. 

I sense a more detailed 

proposal is forthcoming  

Everyone in Westeros 

trusts and respects you. 

If you tell people the threat 

is real  they ll believe it. 

If you advise all the lords 

to send their men north 

to hold the Wall  they ll do it. 

And if you tell every 

maester in the Citadel 

to search every word 

of every faded scroll 

about the Long Night  

they may find something 

that lets us defeat 

the Army of the Dead for good. 

It could be done. 

And this news 

could be authentic. 

It s possible. 

It s also possible 

that this message 

is part of a ploy 

by the Dragon Queen 

to lure southern armies away from the 

lands they are currently defending 

to open those lands 

to easy conquest. 

That does seem far more likely 

than magic birds 

talking to cripples. 

Archmaester  please. 

It s real. 

I ve seen it. 

We will write to Maester Wolkan 

at Winterfell for clarification. 

I promise you we will get to the 

truth of it one way or another. 

  Archmaester  please   

  That will be all  Tarly. 

It brings to mind the 

work of Jenny of Oldstones  

the charlatan who claimed descent 

from the children of the forest. 

Don t forget the prophet Lodos  

who promised that the Drowned God would 

rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror. 

Ah  Lodos. 

Is he the one whose father and 

brother were just burnt alive  

I m afraid so. 

Horrible business. 

I haven t had the heart 

to tell him yet. 

He s a good lad. 

Right. 

The ravenry was falling apart 

the last time I checked. 

All rulers demand 

that people bend the knee. 

That s why they re rulers. 

She gave Tarly a choice  

a man who had taken up 

arms against her. 

What else could she do  

Not burn him alive 

alongside his son  

I am her Hand  not her head. 

I can t make 

her decisions for her. 

That s what I used to tell 

myself about her father. 

I found the traitors  but I wasn t 

the one burning them alive. 

I was only a purveyor 

of information. 

It s what I told myself when I 

watched them beg for mercy   

I m not the one doing it. 

When the pitch of their 

screams rose higher   

I m not the one doing it. 

When their hair caught fire 

and the smell of their burning 

flesh filled the throne room   

I m not the one doing it. 

Daenerys is not her father. 

And she never will be 

with the right counsel. 

You need to find a way 

to make her listen. 

  Who s that for  

  Jon Snow. 

Did you read it  

It s a sealed scroll 

for the King in the North. 

What s it say  

Nothing good. 

I thought Arya was dead. 

I thought Bran was dead. 

I m happy for you. 

You don t look happy. 

Bran saw the Night King 

and his army 

marching towards Eastwatch. 

If they make it past the Wall... 

The Wall has kept them out for 

thousands of years  presumably. 

I need to go home. 

You said you don t 

have enough men. 

We ll fight 

with the men we have. 

Unless you ll join us. 

And give the country to Cersei  

As soon as I march away  

she marches in. 

Perhaps not. 

Cersei thinks the Army of the 

Dead is nothing but a story 

made up by wet nurses 

to frighten children. 

What if we prove her wrong  

I don t think she ll come see 

the dead at my invitation. 

So bring the dead to her. 

I thought that was what 

we were trying to avoid. 

We don t have to 

bring the whole army. 

Only one soldier. 

Is that possible  

The first wight I ever saw 

was brought into Castle 

Black from beyond the Wall. 

Bring one of these things 

down to King s Landing 

and show her the truth. 

Anything you bring back 

will be useless 

unless Cersei 

grants us an audience 

and is somehow convinced 

not to murder us 

the moment we set foot 

in the capital. 

The only person 

she listens to is Jaime. 

He might listen to me. 

And how would you get 

into King s Landing  

I can smuggle you in  

but if the gold cloaks 

were to recognize you  

I m warning you  

I m not a fighter. 

Well  it will all be for nothing 

if we don t have 

one of these dead men. 

Fair point. 

How do you propose to find one  

With the queen s permission  

I ll go north and take one. 

You asked me to find a 

cure so I could serve you. 

Allow me to serve you. 

The Free Folk will help us. 

They know the real north 

better than anyone. 

They won t follow Ser Jorah. 

They won t have to. 

You can t lead a raid 

beyond the Wall. 

You re not in the Night s Watch 

anymore  you re King in the North. 

I m the only one here 

who s fought them. 

I m the only one here 

who knows them. 

I haven t given you 

permission to leave. 

With respect  Your Grace  

I don t need your permission. 

I am a king. 

And I came here 

knowing that you could 

have your men behead me 

or your dragons burn me alive. 

I put my trust 

in you  a stranger  

because I knew it was the 

best chance for my people  

for all our people. 

Now I m asking you 

to trust in a stranger... 

because it s our best chance. 

The King in the North 

should stay in the North. 

We did not choose you 

to rule us  my lady. 

But perhaps we should have. 

The Knights of the Vale came 

here for you  Lady Stark. 

Aye. 

You are very kind  my lords. 

But Jon is our king. 

He is doing what 

he thinks is best. 

I warned Jon this would happen. 

That he couldn t leave the North 

and expect it to just sit 

and wait for him like Ghost. 

He didn t. He trusted 

you to hold it for him. 

Well  he s not making it easy. 

The Northern lords are proud. 

These are Mother 

and Father s chambers. 

And  

Nothing. 

Don t do that. 

  What  

  Say what you mean. 

You always liked nice things. 

They made you feel 

better than everyone. 

Are you angry with me  

They were insulting Jon  

and you sat there and listened. 

I listened to their complaints  

which is my responsibility 

as Lady of Winterfell. 

Their opinions 

are important to you. 

Glover has  men  

Royce has  . 

Offend them 

and Jon loses his army. 

Not if they lose 

their heads first. 

Winterfell didn t just 

fall into our hands. 

We took it back  

and the Mormonts 

and the Hornwoods 

and the wildlings and the Vale. 

All of us  working together. 

Now  I m sure cutting off 

heads is very satisfying  

but that s not the way you 

get people to work together. 

And if Jon doesn t come back  

you ll need their support... 

so you can work together 

to give you 

what you really want. 

How can you even think 

such a horrible thing  

You re thinking it right now. 

You don t want to be  

but the thought 

just won t go away. 

I have work to do. 

My lady. 

Last time I was here  I killed 

my father with a crossbow. 

Last time I was here  you 

killed my son with wildfire. 

There s a path to the left 

that hugs the cliff. 

The guards 

hardly ever patrol it. 

Too many steps. 

You re not staying here  

I ve got my own business 

in Flea Bottom. 

What if someone takes the boat  

Then we re fucked. 

Best hurry. 

We don t have time for this. 

We should be preparing 

the city for a siege. 

The Dothraki are coming. 

All the more reason 

for you to train. 

Unless you plan on fighting 

Dothraki  year olds. 

Well  I seem to recall them giving 

you a bit of trouble as well. 

And here I am  ready to train. 

Why down here  

I don t think 

you want people to see 

how you look swinging 

that thing yet. 

Today might be the day 

I kill you by accident. 

Oh  you won t be 

swinging it at me. 

I ll leave you to it. 

I needed to see you. 

And I knew you d 

never agree to meet. 

You made me look 

like a complete fool. 

I thought I d surprise you 

by hitting Casterly Rock  

but you were 

three steps ahead of me. 

Abandoned the family home  

completely unsentimental. 

Father would have been proud. 

  Don t talk about Father. 

  Listen to me   

I once told Bronn 

that if I ever saw you 

again  I d cut you in half. 

It ll take you a while 

with a sparring sword. 

He was going to execute me. 

He knew I was innocent. 

He didn t hate me 

because of anything I did  

he hated me 

because of what I am. 

A little monster 

sent to punish him. 

Did he   

did he think   

did he think I wanted 

to be born this way  

  Did he think I chose it   

  What do you want   

Daenerys will win this war. 

You re a military man. 

You must know there s 

no way around that. 

Daenerys is not her father. 

She s even willing 

to suspend the hostilities 

if Cersei agrees 

to certain terms. 

If you want Cersei 

to bend the knee  

you can ask her yourself. 

I   I don t. 

And Daenerys doesn t. 

Not right now  anyway. 

She has a more 

important request. 

I wasn t sure I d find you. 

Thought you might 

still be rowing. 

I looked in shops  

taverns  brothels. 

Should have known to come 

straight to the Street of Steel. 

Aren t you worried 

about the gold cloaks  

Haven t been here in years. 

Why should they recognize me  

Sometimes I hardly do. 

Nothing fucks you 

harder than time. 

Anybody give you any trouble  

Here I am  arming Lannisters  

and I never get a second look. 

But you were right. 

Safest place for me was 

right under the queen s nose. 

Don t be so sure. 

Safety is never a permanent 

state of affairs. 

Bad things are coming. 

You came to get me. 

You want me to come with you. 

Well  the thing you need to 

understand is   

I m ready. 

  You   

  Let s go. 

You should know 

what you re heading into. 

What do you think 

I ve been thinking about 

with every swing of the hammer  

How happy I am making weapons 

for the family 

that killed my father  

The family that 

tried to kill me  

I ve been getting ready. 

I never knew what for  

but I ve always known 

I d know it when it comes. 

You might want to bring 

one of those swords. 

I don t know much 

about swinging swords. 

But this... 

this I know. 

Keep your father s name 

to yourself. 

Situation s complicated 

enough already. 

Well  who should I say I am  

I told you  Clovis  if we 

don t get out of here soon  

  someone s going to   

  You there  

No weapons  friends. 

I promise. 

What can I do for you  

  Is that your boat  

  It is. 

  The docks are that way. 

  That they are. 

I try to stay away from them 

to avoid good men 

such as yourselves. 

  Still five gold dragons  

  Are you joking  

You must be even older 

than you look. 

  . 

Apiece. 

I can t say it was a pleasure 

doing business with you. 

What s in the boat  

Not more gold. 

  Wine  

  Mm. 

  I like wine. 

  Or hams. 

Come have a look. 

  Fermented crab. 

  What  

Fermented crab. 

One bucket of this triples a 

brothel s earnings for the week. 

A man thinks he s done. 

He s ready to go back 

to his loving family. 

But before he gets 

his breeches up  

his lady of the hour pops a tiny 

spoon of that into his mouth. 

Five minutes later  

he s back in the race. 

Here  have a taste. 

I d hurry to your 

favorite establishment  

or you ll put a hole 

in that chainmail. 

Oi  dwarf  

I really wouldn t try any more 

until you see how 

the first bite hits you. 

That dwarf... 

Where d you get that scar  

Fish hook. Some men 

you just can t teach. 

We was looking for a dwarf with 

a scar like that a while back. 

Perhaps there s 

some arrangement  

Arrangement  

You gonna arrange to pay us 

more than Queen Cersei   

This is Gendry. 

He ll do. 

Go  go  go. 

I could give you something. 

That won t be necessary. 

Ser Jaime. 

Why was Qyburn here  

He s the Hand of the Queen. 

Why are you here  

I met with Tyrion. 

What did our brother 

have to say  

Daenerys wants to meet. 

To discuss her surrender  

To discuss an armistice. 

She s just won a great victory. 

Why would she want a truce now  

Because an army of dead men 

is marching 

on the Seven Kingdoms. 

Tyrion claims he ll have proof. 

  Are you going to punish him  

  Tyrion  

Bronn. 

He betrayed you. 

He set up a meeting without 

your knowledge or consent. 

Do you think 

anything of importance 

happens in this city 

without me knowing  

You let it happen. 

Why  

I ve come to believe that 

an accommodation 

with the Dragon Queen 

could be in our 

immediate interest. 

She has the numbers. If we want to 

beat her  we have to be clever. 

We have to fight her 

like Father would have. 

Dead men  dragons  

and Dragon Queens... 

Whatever stands in our way  

we will defeat it. 

For ourselves  for our house  

for this. 

Who will you say is the father  

You. 

People won t like that. 

Do you remember what Father 

used to say about people  

The lion does not concern himself 

with the opinions of the sheep. 

Never betray me again. 

We re leaving today. 

  The king s got a lot on his mind. 

  I understand. 

He doesn t need to be thinking about 

harboring the bastard of a dead king. 

  You don t have to worry. 

  You re just Clovis  

a smith who s come 

to pay his respects 

before he heads off to work 

at the Winterfell forges. 

Understood. 

Begging your pardon  Your Grace. 

You survived King s Landing. 

Yet again. Your 

Grace  this is Clo   

Name s Gendry  Your Grace. 

I m Robert Baratheon s son. 

Bastard son. 

He was meant 

to keep that to himself. 

Our fathers trusted each other. 

Why shouldn t we  

I saw your father once 

at Winterfell. 

I met yours in my shop. 

  You re a lot leaner. 

  And you re a lot shorter. 

I grew up on stories about them. 

All I ever knew is that 

they fought together and won. 

Ser Davos told me where you re 

going  Your Grace  and why. 

Let me come with you. 

Don t be a fool. 

You re not a soldier. 

No  but I m a fighter. 

And he won t be needing a 

smith with a sword like that. 

You know how to use one  

Well  that s a problem. 

I prefer a hammer. 

He can handle himself. 

We could use the help. 

As my father used to say  

 It s better to be 

a coward for a minute  

than dead for 

the rest of your life.  

I owe you my life. 

Twice over. 

But if what you said is true 

about what s up there  

I can t wait out this war. 

Yeah  nobody mind me. 

All I ve ever done 

is live to a ripe old age. 

All right  come on. 

You may not believe it  

but I ve missed you  Mormont. 

Nobody glowers quite like you. 

Not even Grey Worm. 

This is the coin 

the slaver gave me 

when I suggested he free us 

and pay us  remember  

It was supposed to last us 

the rest of our lives. 

Take it with you. 

But bring it back. 

Our queen needs you. 

We should be better 

at saying farewell by now. 

Your Grace  I... 

If I don t return  at least 

you won t have to deal 

with the King 

in the North anymore. 

I ve grown used to him. 

I wish you good fortune in the 

wars to come  Your Grace. 

Heave  

Do you know how many 

steps there are in the Citadel  

No. 

 . 

Guess how many windows are 

in the Great Sept of Baelor. 

None anymore. 

That s true. 

This High Septon Maynard  

he recorded everything. 

He even recorded 

his own bowel movements. 

What does  annulment  mean  

It s when a man 

sets aside his lawful wife. 

Maynard says here that he issued 

an annulment for a Prince  Ragger  

and remarried him to someone 

else at the same time 

in a secret ceremony in Dorne. 

Is that a common thing 

in the south or    

These maesters... 

they set me to the task of preserving 

that man s window counting 

and annulments and bowel 

movements for all eternity  

while the secret to 

defeating the Night King s 

probably sitting on some dusty shelf 

somewhere  completely ignored. 

But that s all right  isn t it  

We can all become slavering  murderous 

imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate 

as long as we can have access 

to the full records 

of High Septon Maynard s 

  shits  

Steps. 

That number was the steps. 

Are you sure 

you want to do this  

You always wanted 

to be a maester. 

I m tired of reading about 

the achievements of better men. 

I found it  my lord. 

It  uh  took some searching. 

Maester Luwin s archives 

are very thorough. 

You re sure this is the 

only copy in Winterfell  

Uh  yes  my lord. 

Lady Stark thanks you 

for your service. 

Isn t it your 

job to talk him out 

of stupid fucking 

ideas like this  

I ve been failing 

at that job of late. 

How many queens are there now  

Two. 

And you need to convince 

the one with the dragons 

or the one who 

fucks her brother  

Both. 

How many men did you bring  

Not enough. 

The big woman  

We were hoping some of 

your men could help. 

  Hmm. 

  I ll be staying behind. 

I m a liability out there  

as you well know. 

You are. 

You really want to go out there  

Again  

You re not the only ones. 

My scouts found them 

a mile south of the Wall. 

Said they were 

on their way here. 

You re the Hound. 

I saw you once at Winterfell. 

They want to go 

beyond the Wall  too. 

We don t want to go beyond 

the Wall  we have to. 

Our Lord told us that 

the Great War is coming   

Don t trust him. 

Don t trust any of them. 

They re the Brotherhood. 

And the last thing 

their lord told them to do 

was sell me to a red witch 

to be murdered. 

Thoros  

I hardly recognized you. 

Ser Jorah Mormont. 

They won t give me anything 

to drink down here. 

I haven t been feeling 

like myself. 

You re a fucking Mormont  

Like the last Lord Commander  

He was my father. 

He hunted us like animals. 

You returned the favor  

as I recall. 

Here we all are 

at the edge of the world 

at the same moment  

heading in the same direction 

for the same reason. 

Our reasons aren t your reasons. 

It doesn t matter 

what we think our reasons are. 

There s a greater 

purpose at work. 

And we serve it together  

whether we know it or not. 

We may take the steps  

but the Lord of Light   

For fuck s sake  

will you shut your hole  

Are we coming with you or not  

Don t you want to know 

what we re doing  

Is it worse than sitting in a 

freezing cell  waiting to die  

He s right. 

We re all on the same side. 

How can we be  

We re all breathing. 

Jon  You alright  

Tormund  Haven t been North before  

Gendry  Never seen snow before. 

..Beautiful  eh  

I can breathe again. 

Tormund  Down south the air smells like pig shit. 

Jon  You ve never been down south. 

Tormund  I ve been to Winterfell. 

Jon  That s the North. 

Gendry  How do you live up here  

...How d you keep your balls 

from freezing off  

Tormund  You ve got to keep moving  

that s the secret. 

...Walking s good  

fighting s better  

..fucking s best. 

Jon  There s not a living woman 

within  miles from here. 

Tormund  We ve got to make due with what we ve got. 

Tormund  This one is maybe not so smart. 

Jon  Davos says he s a strong fighter. 

Tormund  Good. 

...That s more important than being smart. 

...Smart people don t come here 

looking for the dead. 

Tormund  So  you ve met this Dragon queen  huh  

And  

Jon  She will only fight beside us 

if I bend the knee. 

Tormund You spent too much time with the Free Folk. 

Now you don t like kneeling. 

...Mance Rayder was a great man. 

Proud man. 

The King Beyond the Wall and everything. 

How many of his people died 

for his pride  

Thoros  You still mad at us  boy  

Gendry  You sold me to a witch. 

Thoros  A priestess. 

..I ll admit it  it is a subtle distinction. 

Beric  We re fighting a great war. 

..Wars cost money. 

Gendry  I wanted to be one of you. 

..I wanted to join the Brotherhood 

but you sold me off. 

Like a slave. 

You know what she did to me  

She struck me down on the bed  

she stripped me naked... 

Hound  Sounds alright so far... 

Gendry  And put leeches on me  

Hound  Was she naked too  

Thoros  She needed your blood. 

Gendry to Thoros   Yes  thank you  I know that. 

Hound  Could ve been worse. 

Gendry to Hound   She wanted to kill me. 

  And would have killed me if it weren t for... 

Hound  But they didn t  did they  

..So what you winging about  

Gendry  I m not winging. 

Your lips are moving and you complain 

about something. That s winging. 

This one has been killed six times and 

you don t hear him bitching about it. 

Good lad. 

The first time I went north of the Wall  

was with your father. 

He was a good man. 

He deserved a better son. 

Were you with him at the end  

I was a prisoner of the wildlings. 

But we avenged him. 

I want you to know that  

every mutineer found justice. 

Can t think of a worse way for him to go. 

The Night s Watch was his life. He would 

have died to protect every one of those men. 

And they butchered him. 

I hate that he died that way. 

And my father was the most honorable man 

I have ever met. 

He was good  all the way through. 

And he died on the executioner s block. 

Your father wanted to execute me  

you know. 

I heard. 

It was in the right  of course. 

Didn t make me hate him any less. 

I m glad he didn t catch you. 

Your father gave me this sword. 

Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf. 

But it s still Longclaw. 

Lord Commander Mormont thought 

you d never come back to Westeros. 

But you are back. 

And it s been in your family for centuries. 

It s not right for me to have it. 

He gave it to you. 

I m not his son. 

I brought shame onto my house. 

I broke my father s heart. 

I forfeited the right to claim his sword. 

It s yours. 

May it serve you well. 

And your children after you. 

Father used to watch us from up here. 

He wouldn t say much. 

You probably don t remember  

you were inside knitting all the time. 

I remember. 

One times the boys were 

shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick  

I came out here after 

and Bran had left his bow behind  

just lying on the ground. 

Ser Rodrick would have 

cuffed him if he saw. 

There was one arrow in the target 

and with no one around  just like now. 

No one to stop me. 

So I started shooting. 

And every shot I had to go up there and get my 

one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. 

I wasn t very good. 

Finally  I ve hit the bull s eye. 

Could ve been the  shot. Or the . 

I don t remember. 

But I hit the bull s eye. 

And I heard this. clapping sound  

I looked up. 

And he was standing right here  

smiling down on me. 

I knew what I was doing 

was against the rules 

but he was smiling  so I 

knew it wasn t wrong. 

The rules were wrong. 

I was doing what I was meant 

to be doing and he knew it. 

Now he s dead. 

Killed by the Lannisters. 

With your help. 

What  

That s your pretty handwriting. 

Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles 

cause I couldn t write as well as you. 

Robb  

I write to you today with heavy heart. 

Our good King Robert is dead. 

  Killed from wounds he took in a bull... 

  You don t have to read it. 

  I remember. 

  Father has been charged with treason. 

He conspired with Robert s brothers 

against my beloved Joffrey 

and tried to steal his throne. 

The Lannisters are treating me well 

and providing me with every comfort. 

I beg you  come to King s Landing  

swear fealty to King Joffrey 

and prevent any strife between the 

great houses of Lannister and Stark 

Your faithful sister  Sansa. 

  They forced me to do it. 

  Did they  

With a knife at your throat  

Did they put you in a rack and stretched 

you till your bones started to crack  

You should have known what it was like. 

I was a child. 

So was I. 

I would have let them kill me 

before I betrayed my family. 

They told me it was the 

only way to save father. 

And you were stupid enough to believe them. 

I remember you  standing on that platform 

with Joffrey and Cersei when they 

dragged father to the block. 

I remember the pretty dress you were 

wearing  the fancy way you did your hair. 

  You were there. 

  I was there. 

Standing in the crown near Baelor s statue. 

And what did you do  Did you 

come running to the rescue  

Did you fight with the 

Lannisters and save father  

  I wanted to. 

  But you didn t. 

  Just like me. 

  I didn t betray him. I didn t betray Robb. 

I didn t betray my entire family 

for my beloved Joffrey. 

You should be on your knees thanking me. 

We re standing in Winterfell 

again because of me. 

You didn t win it back  Jon didn t win it 

back  he lost the Battle of the Bastards. 

The Knights of the Vale won the battle 

and they rode north for me. 

While you were off where  Travelling the world  

  I was training. 

  Training  

Well  while you were training  I 

suffered things you can never imagine. 

Oh  I didn t know that and 

I can imagine quite a lot. 

You never would have 

survived what I survived. 

I guess we ll never know. 

What are you going to do with that letter  

I don t know yet. 

Who did you show it to  

Where did you find it  

You re scared  aren t you  

What are you scared of  

You didn t commit any crimes. 

No one s gonna hang you. 

You re scared I ll show it to Jon 

  Arya  

  and he ll be angry. 

Not  that s not Jon. 

He ll understand  

you were just a scared little girl. 

All alone with the wicked Lannisters. 

Do you know how happy Cersei would 

be right now if she saw us fighting  

This is exactly what she 

wants  what she always wanted. 

You are scared the Northern 

lords will read it. 

They wouldn t think much of Lady Sansa 

if they knew how she did Cersei s bidding. 

What would little Lyanna Mormont say  

She s younger than you 

were when you wrote this. 

Are you going to say  But 

I was just a child   

You re angry. 

Sometimes anger makes people 

do unfortunate things. 

Sometimes fear makes them 

do unfortunate things. 

I ll go with anger. 

You re the one they call the dog. 

Fuck off. 

They told me you were mean. 

Were your born mean or 

you just hate wildlings  

I don t give two shits about wildlings. 

Gingers  I hate. 

Gingers are beautiful. 

Kissed by fire. 

Just like you. 

Don t point your fucking finger at me. 

Did you trip into the fire 

when you were a baby  

I didn t trip  I was pushed. 

Ever since  you ve been mean. 

Fuck off. 

I don t think you re truly mean. 

You have sad eyes. 

You want to suck my dick  is that it  

  Dick  

  Cock. 

Ah  dick. 

I like it. 

Bet you do. 

Nop  it s pussy for me. 

I have a beauty waiting for 

me back in Winterfell. 

If I ever get back there. 

Yellow hair  

blue eyes. 

Tallest woman you ve ever seen. 

Almost as tall as you. 

Brienne of Tarth  

  You know her  

  You re with Brienne of fucking Tarth  

Well  not with her yet. 

But I see the way she looks at me. 

How does she look at you  

Like she wants to carve you 

up and eat your liver  

You do know her. 

We ve met. 

I want to make babies with her. 

Think of them. 

Great big monsters. 

They conquer the world. 

How did a mad fucker like you 

live this long  

I m good at killing people. 

  You don t look much like him. 

  Who s that  

Your father. 

I suppose you favor your mother. 

You knew him  

Of course I did. 

When he was Hand. 

He sent me off hunting for the Mountain. 

Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman 

brought you back. 

Thoros has brought me back 

six times. 

We both serve the same lord. 

I serve the North. 

The North did not raise you from the dead. 

The Lord of Light never spoke to me. 

I don t know anything about him. I 

don t know what he wants from me. 

He wants you alive. 

  Why  

  I don t know. 

That s all anyone can tell me. 

I don t know. 

So what s the point of serving a god  

none of us knows what he wants  

I think about that all the time. 

I don t think it s our purpose to understand. 

Except one thing. 

We re soldiers. 

We have to know what we re fighting for. 

I m not fighting so some man or woman I barely 

know can sit in a throne made of swords. 

So what are you fighting for  

Life. 

Death is the enemy. 

The first enemy. 

And the last. 

But we all die. 

The enemy always wins. 

And we still need to fight him. 

That s all I know. 

You and I won t find much 

joy while we re here. 

But we can keep up the life. 

We can defend those who 

can t defend themselves. 

 I am the shield that 

guards the realms of men.  

Maybe we don t need to 

understand anymore than that. 

Maybe that s enough. 

Aye. 

Maybe that s enough. 

That s what I saw in the fire. 

A mountain like an arrow head. 

Are you sure  

We re getting close. 

Do you know what I like about you  

  I honestly don t. 

  You re not a hero. 

Oh. 

I ve been heroic on occasion. 

I once charged through the Mud Gate 

of King s Landing. 

I don t want you to be a hero. 

Heroes do stupid things and they die. 

Drogo  Jorah  Daario  

even this... 

Jon Snow. 

They all try to outdo each other. 

You can do the stupidest bravest thing... 

It s interesting  these heroes you name... 

Drogo  Jorah  

Daarios  even this... 

Jon Snow... 

They all fell in love with you. 

Jon Snow is not in love with me. 

Oh  my mistake. 

I suppose he stares at you longingly because 

he s hopeful for a successful military alliance. 

He s too little for me. 

I didn t mean... 

Sure     he is quite little. 

I know you re brave. 

I wouldn t have chosen a coward as my Hand. 

So... 

if all goes well  I ll finally 

get to meet your sister. 

From everything you ve told me about her 

she d rather murder me than speak. 

Oh... 

first she d torture you in some 

horrible way  then she d murder you. 

Nobody trusts my sister less than I do  

believe me. 

But if we go to the capital  

we ll go with two armies  

we ll go with three dragons  

and anyone touches you  

King s Landing burns down 

to the foundation stone. 

And right now she s thinking 

of how to set a trap. 

Of course she is. 

And she s wondering what 

trap you re laying for her. 

Are we  

Laying any traps  

If we want to create a 

new and better world  

I m not sure deceit and mass murder 

are the best ways to start. 

Which war was won without deceit and mass murder  

Yes  you ll need to be ruthless if 

you re going to win the throne. 

You need to inspire a degree of fear. 

But fear is all Cersei has. 

It s all my father had... 

And Joffrey. 

It makes their power brittle. 

Because everyone beneath 

them longs to see them dead. 

Aegon Targaryen got quite 

a long way on fear. 

He did. 

But you once spoke to me 

of breaking the wheel. 

Aegon built the wheel. 

If that s the kind of queen you want to be  

how are you different from all the 

other tyrants that came before you  

So we walk into the lion s den  

My brother promised me he d keep 

a grip on the Lannister forces. 

Forgive me  but I don t care 

about any Lannister promises. 

Except yours. 

And I promised him 

I d keep you from doing anything impulsive. 

Impulsive  

This will be a difficult negotiation. 

We re sitting down with people who 

want to see us both headless. 

My sister is likely to say 

something provocative. 

And  

And you ve been known to lose 

your temper from time to time. 

  As all our great leaders do... 

  When have I lost my temper  

Burning the Tarlys for instance. 

That was not impulsive. 

That was necessary. 

  Perhaps. 

  Perhaps. 

Perhaps the father needed 

to die and not the son. 

Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate 

the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. 

We had no time to discuss the possibility 

before you ended their possibilities. 

One can be forgiven for thinking you re 

taking your family s side in this debate. 

I am taking their side. 

You need to take your enemy s side  

if you re going to see the things they do. 

And you need to see things the way they do 

if you re going to anticipate their actions  

respond effectively and beat them. 

Which I want you to do very much. 

Because I believe in you 

and the world you want to build. 

But the world you want to build 

doesn t get build all at once. 

Probably not in a single lifetime. 

How do we ensure your vision endures  

After you break the wheel  how 

do we make sure it stays broken  

You want to know who sits on the 

Iron Throne after I m dead  

You say you can t have children. 

But there are other ways 

of choosing a successor. 

The Night s Watch has one method  

The Iron born folk  

among their many flaws... 

We will discuss the succession 

after I wear the crown. 

Your Grace  I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards 

you when you fought on Blackwater Rush  

and I saw hundred of arrows miss. 

But any one of them could have 

found your heart and end... 

You ve been thinking about my 

death quite a bit  haven t you  

Is this one of the items you ve discussed 

with your brother in King s Landing  

I m trying to serve you by 

planning on the long term. 

Perhaps if you d planned 

for the short term  

we wouldn t have lost Dorne and Highgarden. 

We will discuss the succession 

after I wear the crown. 

A bear. 

We can fuck her 

The bears have blue eyes. 

We have to get him back to Eastwatch. 

flask 

Go on. 

Alright. 

I just got bit by a dead bear. 

Aye. 

You did. 

Funny old life. 

Alright then. 

  Where did she get it  

  I don t know. 

She seems very resourceful. 

You re worried. 

We re asking   men to fight with us 

in the worst winter any 

of them had ever seen. 

The weather will be the 

least of their problems. 

Many of them will be happy to 

find a good reason to go home. 

You question their loyalty  

Their loyalty is to Jon. 

Jon is not here. I haven t 

heard from him in weeks. 

You re the Lady of Winterfell. 

The King chose you to rule in his absence. 

And rule you have. 

Wisely. 

Ably. 

They say that  they respect you. 

Some may even prefer you. 

Yes  they turned their backs on Jon 

when it was time to retake Winterfell 

and then they named him their king and now 

they re ready to turn their backs on him again. 

How far would you trust men like that  

bloody wind vanes 

If they found out I wrote that letter... 

a woman who s already married not 

one but two enemies of her House... 

By the time Jon comes back  

he ll have no army left. 

Arya is not like them. 

She s your sister. 

You may have disagreements  

but she would never betray her family. 

She would if she thought 

I was going to betray Jon. 

Is that what she thinks  

I don t know what she thinks. 

I don t know her anymore. 

Perhaps Lady Brienne can help. 

She s sworn to protect both 

of Catelyn Stark girls. 

Did she not  

She is. 

And if one of you were planning 

to harm the other in any way  

wouldn t she be      

She would. 

Something I ve always wanted to know. 

Alright. 

How drunk were you when you charged 

through the bridge on Pyke  

For being honest  I don t remember 

charging through the bridge. 

Some of the lads told me 

about it the next morning. 

Some damn good scrap. 

Alright. 

It was a proper scrap. 

The Ironborn thought you were 

some kind of god. 

You were waving that flaming sword. 

I thought you were the bravest man 

I ever saw. 

Just the drunkest. 

Where s the rest of them  

If we wait long enough 

we will find out. 

Go back to Eastwatch. 

Get a raven to Daenerys  

tell her what s happened. 

  I m not leaving you. 

  You re the fastest. 

Go  Now  

You re faster without the hammer. 

Give it  

Give it  

Stop  

Go  

What happened  

Where are the others  

Raven. 

We need to send the raven. 

Get the maester  Now  

Thoros  

Thoros  

I d say it s one of the better ways to go. 

Lord of Light  

show us the way. 

Come to us in our darkness and 

lead your servant into the light. 

We have to burn this body. 

And all the clothes behind him. 

Unless the Lord of Light is kind 

enough to send us a bit of fire. 

Come to us in our darkness. 

For the night is dark and full of terrors. 

We ll all freeze soon. 

I saw the water. 

When you killed the white walker  

almost all the dead that followed him     . 

Why  

Maybe he was the one who turned them. 

We can go for the walkers. 

  Maybe we ll stand a chance. 

  No. 

We need to take that thing back with us. 

There s a raven flying for Dragonstone now. 

Daenerys is our only chance. 

No. 

There s another. 

Kill him. 

He turned them all. 

You don t understand. 

The Lord brought you back... 

he brought me back... 

No one else  just us. 

Did he do it to watch us freeze to death  

Careful  Beric  you ve lost your priest. 

This is your last life. 

I ve been waiting for the end for a long time. 

Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it. 

Every Lord I ve ever met it s been a cunt. 

Can t see why the Lord of Light 

should be any different. 

Milady. 

Milady. 

It s an invitation. 

To King s Landing. 

  Milady  you are the Lady of Winterfell. 

  I am. 

And you will represent my interest 

at this gathering as you see them. 

They invited you  they want you there. 

I will not set foot in King s Landing while 

Cersei Lannister is queen. 

They want another Stark prisoner  

they can come and take me. 

Until then  I ll remain where I belong. 

I have work to do here. 

It s not safe. 

Ser Jaime will be there. 

You said he treated you honourably before. 

I m not worried about me. 

It s not safe leaving 

you with Littlefinger. 

I have many guards who d happily 

imprison him or behead him 

whether or not you re here. 

And you trust their loyalty  

You trust he hasn t been speaking 

to them all behind your back  

Let me at least leave Podrick 

behind to watch over you. 

He has become a competent swordsman. 

I do not need to be watched 

over or minded or cared for. 

I m not a child  I am the Lady 

of Winterfell and I am home. 

This is the safest place for me. 

Milady. 

I sworn an oath to protect 

you and your sister. 

If I abandon you... 

The trip to King s Landing 

is long  Lady Brienne  

and you won t be travelling 

on summer roads. 

The sooner you leave  the better 

your chances of making it on time. 

Yes  Milady. 

You can t  

The most important person in the world can t 

fly off to the most dangerous place in the world. 

  Who else can  

  No one. 

They knew the risk when they left. 

You can t win the throne if you re dead. 

You can t break the wheel if you re dead. 

  So what would you have me do  

  Nothing. 

Sometimes nothing is the 

hardest thing to do. 

If you die 

we re all lost. 

Everyone  everything... 

You told me to do nothing before 

and I ve listened to you. 

I m not doing nothing again. 

Dumb cunt. 

Oh  fuck. 

Fall back  

Fall back  

Come on  

Help me  

Jon  

Go  

Go now  Leave  

Uncle Benjen  

Come with me. 

It s not time. 

Go  

We ll meet again  Clegane. 

Fucking hope not. 

It s time to go  Your Grace. 

A bit longer. 

Not what you re looking for  

I have hundreds of men here at 

Winterfell  all loyal to me. 

They re not here now. 

  What are these  

  My faces. 

  Where did you get them  

  In Braavos  

while I was training to be a faceless man. 

What does that mean  

Back in Braavos  before 

I got my first face  

there was I game I used to play. 

The game of faces. 

It s simple  I ask you a 

question about yourself 

and you try to make a lie 

sound like the truth. 

If you fool me  you win. 

If I catch a lie  you lose. 

Let s play. 

I don t want to play. 

How do you feel about Jon being king  

Is there someone else you think should 

rule the North instead of him  

Those faces  what are they  

Is that what you should be asking  

Are you sure  

The game of faces didn t turn out so well 

for the last person who asked me questions. 

Tell me what they are  

We both wanted to be other people when 

we were younger. 

You wanted to be a queen. 

To sit next to a handsome young king 

on the Iron Throne. 

I wanted to be a knight 

To pick up a sword like 

father and go off to battle. 

Neither of us got to be the other person  

did we  

The world doesn t just let girls 

decide what they are going to be. 

But I can now. 

With the faces I can choose. 

I can become someone else. 

Speak in their voice  live in their skin. 

I can even become you. 

I wonder what it would feel like 

to wear those pretty dresses. 

To be the Lady of Winterfell. 

All I d need to find out 

is your face. 

I m sorry. 

I m so sorry. 

I wish I could take it back. 

I wish we d never gone. 

I don t. 

If we hadn t gone I wouldn t have seen. 

You have to see it to know. 

Now I know. 

The dragons are my children. 

They re the only children I ll ever have. 

We are going to destroy the Night King 

and his army. 

And we ll do it together. 

You have my word. 

Thank you  Dany. 

Dany... 

Who was the last person who called me that  

I m not sure  is it my brother  

Not the company you want to keep. 

Alright. 

Not Dany. 

How about  My Queen   

I d... 

bend the knee but... 

What about those who 

swore allegiance to you  

They ll all come to see 

you for what you are. 

I hope I deserve it. 

You do. 

You should get some rest. 

This march is a distraction. 

My grandfather s funeral 

is not a distraction. 

  Are we riding to battle at Riverrun  

  No. 

Then it s a distraction. 

  They re growing fast. 

  Not fast enough. 

I need an army. 

 i We ll be in Astapor  i  

 i by nightfall.  i  

 i Some say the Unsullied are the  i  

 i greatest soldiers in the world.  i  

 i The greatest slave soldiers  i  

 i in the world.  i  

 i   Who are you   i  

  Thoros of Myr. 

  Who do you fight for  

   i The Brotherhood without Banners.  i  

The lords of Westeros 

want to burn the countryside. 

We re trying to save it. 

  Your sister sent me. 

  Yara  

I ll come for you tonight 

when the castle sleeps. 

I have been searching 

for you  Daenerys Stormborn  

to ask your forgiveness. 

I am Barristan Selmy  

Kingsguard to your father. 

I will not fail you again. 

 i   What s wrong with him   i  

 i   He s a warg.  i  

 i He can enter the mind of animals   i  

 i see through their eyes.  i  

He s scouting for us. 

Orell  where were you 

this time  

The Fist of the First Men. 

  What did you see  

  Dead crows. 

Get up  Tarly. 

I forbid you to die. 

You re responsible for him. 

 i Make sure he gets back alive.  i  

So good to see you 

again  Clegane. 

Girl. 

What in seven hells 

are you doing 

with the Stark bitch  

Get up. 

Ah  

Let us go and my father will pay 

you whatever you want. 

Enough to buy me a new head  

 i If I may  nephew   i  

I encountered a situation 

with one of my lieutenants 

at the Stone Mill 

which may have some bearing   

Why don t you shut your mouth 

about that damned mill  

And don t call him  nephew.  

He is your king. 

Robb knows 

I meant him no disr   

You re lucky I m not your king. 

I wouldn t let you wave 

your blunders around 

like a victory flag. 

My blunder sent Tywin s mad dog 

scurrying back to Casterly Rock with 

his tail between his legs. 

I think King Robb understands 

we re not gonna win this war 

if he s the only one 

winning any battles. 

No  there s glory enough 

to go around. 

It s not about glory. 

Your instructions were to wait 

for him to come to you. 

I seized an opportunity. 

What value was the mill  

The Mountain was garrisoned 

across the river from it. 

 i Is he there now   i  

Of course not. 

We took the fight to him. 

He could not withstand us. 

I wanted to draw 

the Mountain into the west  

into our country where 

we could surround him and kill him. 

I wanted him to chase us  

which he would have done 

because he is a mad dog 

without a strategic thought 

in his head. 

I could have that head 

on a spike by now. 

Instead  I have a mill. 

 i We took hostages.  i  

Willem Lannister. 

Martyn Lannister. 

Willem and Martyn Lannister 

are  years old. 

Martyn is   I believe. 

Tywin Lannister has my sisters. 

Have I sued for peace  

No. 

Do you think 

he ll sue for peace 

because we have his father s 

brother s 

great grandsons  

No. 

How many men did you lose  

. 

But for every man we lost  

the Lannisters   

We need our men more 

than Tywin needs his  

I m sorry. 

  I didn t know. 

  You would have. 

Right here today at this gathering 

if you had been patient. 

We seem to be running 

short of patience here. 

You know who isn t  

Tywin Lannister. 

Intimate. 

Lovely table. 

 i Better chairs than the old  i  

 i small council chamber.  i  

Conveniently close 

to your own quarters. I like it. 

What news of Jaime  

  unwashed Northerners 

have known about 

his escape for weeks. 

 i Collectively  you control  i  

 i more spies and informants  i  

than the rest 

of the world combined. 

Do you mean to tell me 

that none of you 

has any notion of where he is  

  We are trying  my lord. 

  Try harder. 

 i What do we have  then   i  

Robb Stark and most of his 

bannermen are in Riverrun 

for the funeral of his grandfather 

Lord Hoster Tully. 

In Stark s absence  

Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal  

which would seem to make 

him Lord of Harrenhal  

  in practice if not in name. 

   i Well  let him have it.  i  

The name suits our purposes 

far more than that 

useless pile of rubble. 

The Lord of Harrenhal will make a 

worthy suitor for the widow Arryn. 

For which I am extremely 

grateful to you  my lord. 

 i Lady Arryn and I have known  i  

 i each other since we were children.  i  

She has always been... 

positively predisposed 

toward me. 

A successful courtship 

would make Lord Baelish 

acting Lord of the Vale. 

Titles do seem to breed titles. 

You ll leave for the Eyrie 

as soon as possible 

and bring Lysa Arryn 

into the fold. 

Then the young wolf can add 

his own aunt to the list 

of people who have 

taken up arms against him. 

Far be it from me 

to hinder true love  

 i but Lord Baelish s absence  i  

 i would present certain problems.  i  

The royal wedding may end up 

being the most expensive 

event in living memory. 

 i Summer has ended   i  

 i hard days lie ahead.  i  

Not a good time to leave the 

crown s finances unattended. 

 i Fully agreed.  i  

Which is why I m naming you 

new Master of Coin. 

Master of Coin  

It would appear to be a position 

that best suits your talents. 

I m quite good 

at spending money  

but a lifetime 

of outrageous wealth 

hasn t taught me much 

about managing it. 

I have no doubt you will 

prove equal to this challenge. 

Hear  hear. 

 i     He lifted her  i  

 i high in the air      i  

    He sniffed and roared 

and smelled her there     

    She kicked and wailed  

a maid so fair     

    But he licked the honey 

from her hair     

    From there to here  

from here to there     

    All black and brown 

and covered with hair     

    He smelled that girl 

in the summer air     

    The bear  the bear 

and the maiden fair...     

I hope you re pleased. 

If you had armed me  

they never would have taken us. 

You were armed 

when we were taken. 

I was in chains if you recall. 

Our little match would 

have ended quite quick 

if my hands weren t bound. 

All my life I ve been 

hearing   Jaime Lannister  

what a brilliant swordsman.  

You were slower 

than I expected. 

And more predictable. 

I ve been sitting 

in a muddy pen 

wrapped in chains 

for the past year. 

And I m a woman. 

I was still beating you. 

You were not beating me. 

Maybe you were as good 

as people said... 

once. 

Or maybe people just love 

to overpraise a famous name. 

When we make camp tonight  

you ll be raped. 

More than once. 

None of these fellows have 

ever been with a noblewoman. 

You d be wise not to resist. 

  Would I  

  They ll knock your teeth out. 

You think I care 

about my teeth  

No  I don t think you 

care about your teeth. 

If you fight them  

they will kill you. 

Do you understand  

I m the prisoner 

of value  not you. 

Let them have what they want. 

What does it matter  

  What does it matter  

  Close your eyes. 

Pretend they re Renly. 

If you were a woman  

you wouldn t resist  

You d let them 

do what they wanted  

If I was a woman  

I d make them kill me. 

But I m not  thank the gods. 

If I had a proper forge  

I could make it good as new. 

Doesn t have to look pretty. 

It just has to keep 

the arrows out of my heart. 

Why are you helping him  

He takes us prisoner 

and now he s our friend  

 i You re not our prisoner   i  

 i little lady.  i  

  What am I  

  Our guest. 

No one s put any chains on you. 

So I can walk away  then  

These woods aren t safe 

for Ned Stark s daughter. 

You re lucky we found you. 

You think you re good with 

that bow  you little twat  

Better than anyone 

you ve ever met. 

 i A coward s weapon.  i  

 i I like to fight up close.  i  

I like to see a man s face 

when I put the steel in him. 

Why  

So you can kiss him  

You remember the last time 

you were here  

Looks like every other 

shit inn on the road. 

Now  apologies  

but you re one ugly fucker 

and I d rather not 

see you no more. 

Watch your head. 

Off we go. 

 i Walk up   i  

What are you doing  

We re about to leave. 

I m staying. 

You re what  

I baked some brown bread 

for the innkeep 

and she said 

she never had better. 

Told Thoros she s keeping me 

as a payment 

for all the free meals 

she s given him. 

Anyway  it s not me 

the Brotherhood wants. 

My brother ain t no king. 

I m not a Stark of Winterhell. 

Winterfell. 

  You sure  

  I m sure. 

Well  I made you something. 

What is it  

It s a wolf. 

Yes  it is. 

That s the tail  

Yeah. 

Well  be safe. 

Yeah  you  too. 

Don t get stabbed. 

You don t... 

burn your fingers. 

Good bye  Hot Pie. 

Good bye  Arry. 

Up you go  little lady. 

 i Hey  Hot Pie.  i  

It s really good. 

A person could 

almost be forgiven 

for forgetting we re at war. 

It often comforts me to think 

that even in war s darkest days  

in most places in the world 

absolutely nothing 

is happening. 

I ve missed you  Uncle. 

Father missed you  too  

from the day you left. 

Maybe he never said it 

in so many words   

Maybe  

Your father 

was a stubborn old ox. 

I was surprised when he died. 

Didn t think death 

had the patience. 

I m glad you were with him. 

I wish to the gods I had been. 

Did you make peace in the end  

After  years of fighting  

I don t think he remembered 

what started it. 

He asked me to stop 

calling myself Blackfish. 

He said it was an old joke 

and it was never funny 

to begin with. 

I told him people had been 

calling me Blackfish 

for so long  they don t 

remember my real name. 

Every time he would leave 

for the capital 

or fight in a campaign  

I d see him off. 

 Wait for me  

little Cat   he d say. 

 Wait for me 

and I ll come back 

to you.  

And I would sit at this window 

every day when the sun 

came up  waiting. 

I wonder 

how many times 

did Bran or Rickon 

stare across the moors 

of Winterfell 

waiting for me to return. 

 i I will never see them again.  i  

You mustn t think it. 

We don t know the truth. 

They could be in hiding. 

Robb believes they re alive. 

And he must go on believing. 

He s got to remain strong 

if he s to prevail. 

And you must remain 

strong for him. 

You re Robb Stark s wife. 

Hold still. 

Is it true 

what they say about him  

I don t know. 

What do they say about him  

That he can turn 

into a wolf at night. 

True. 

And he eats the flesh 

of his enemies. 

True. 

You re a Lannister  aren t you  

Martyn Lannister. 

Martyn Lannister. 

You ve nothing to fear. 

My husband 

doesn t eat children. 

Unless it s a full moon. 

It s not a full moon 

tonight  is it  

See  

Nothing to fear. 

Always the artists. 

It s only horses. 

No men. 

You said there was dead crows. 

There was. 

How many men were here  

About . 

And you know 

what those men are now  

We re all the same to them   

meat for their army. 

Do you think anyone got away  

 i It s not impossible.  i  

 i You don t go far  i  

 i betting against Mormont.  i  

But dead or alive  

he took a big gamble 

coming north. 

 i And he lost.  i  

His best fighting men are dead. 

And whether he s Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch 

or a blue eyed corpse  

he s a long way from home. 

Tormund. 

Climb the Wall. 

Take Orell and  good men. 

And take this one. 

He knows Castle Black s 

defenses better than any of us. 

And if he s useful  good. 

If not... 

throw him off the Wall. 

See if crows can fly. 

We re finally going to war  

old friend  

Hide near Castle Black. 

When I give the signal  

hit them in the night. 

They ve got a big old wall 

to hide behind  

but it only guards one side. 

  We ll meet again. 

  Aye. 

  If you do your job. 

  Ah. 

How will we see your signal  

Send your eagle above 

the Wall every night. 

When it s time  I m going 

to light the biggest fire 

the North has ever seen. 

Ghost  

What have we here  

Frozen crows  

We ve come a long way. 

 i Smaller flock  i  

 i than you went north with.  i  

We can talk inside. 

Oh  can we  

 i They need some water.  i  

 i Tether it and I ll be inside.  i  

 i Keep your eyes  i  

 i where they belong.  i  

They re not for you. 

Bet you feed that pig 

better than you feed us. 

Aye  pig s got value to me. 

You should all be kissing 

my feet for letting you in. 

I d have turned you all away 

if I wasn t a godly man. 

You are a godly man  

I am. 

I got no fear of what s out there. 

 i When the white cold comes   i  

 i your swords and cloaks  i  

 i and bloody fires won t help you.  i  

The only ones left will be 

those who are right with the gods. 

The real gods. 

Go tell her she can 

bite down on a rag 

or she can bite down 

on my fist. 

Women. 

That sow right there gave birth 

 i to a litter of eight.  i  

Barely a grunt. 

And she s almost as fat 

as this one here. 

Now why don t you dine on him  

Carve off what you need 

as you go. 

Well  look at him. 

He s a walking feast. 

 i Here we are.  i  

 i Sharpen these for me  would ya   i  

 i I see the head.  i  

 i Push.  i  

That s it. 

 i You re nearly there.  i  

One more push should do it. 

What is it  

What is it  

Keep quiet. 

If you can t ride  

we don t stand a chance. 

I can ride. 

You re sure  

Ride east. 

Follow the rising sun. 

 i Your sister s waiting for you.  i  

I ll make you a Lord 

of the Iron Islands for this. 

We re not in the Iron Islands. 

  Go. 

  Come on. 

Come on. 

Come on. 

Come on. Come on. 

 i Come on back.  i  

 i You refuse to tell me  i  

 i where you re going   i  

 i I don t know yet.  i  

 i The fires will show me.  i  

  How long will you be gone  

  I don t know. 

You re abandoning me. 

I will never abandon you. 

You are the Son of Fire. 

  I am sworn to serve you. 

  Then serve me. 

When I return  

you will understand. 

My enemies think 

they ve destroyed me. 

They re laughing at me 

the way Renly laughed at me. 

I want Joffrey dead. 

I want Robb Stark dead. 

Make me another son. 

I cannot. 

Why  

You don t have the strength. 

It would kill you. 

I m not so easily killed. 

Men have been trying for years. 

I want you. 

Your fires burn low  my king. 

There is another way. 

A better way. 

You told me your magic 

requires a king s blood. 

  Yes. 

  I m the one true king. 

You are. 

But there are others 

with your blood in their veins. 

You will sit 

on the Iron Throne  

but first there must 

be sacrifices. 

The Lord of Light demands it. 

The Walk of Punishment 

is a warning  Your Grace. 

  To whom  

  To any slave who contemplates doing 

whatever these slaves did. 

Give me your water. 

Khaleesi  this man 

has been sentenced to death. 

Here  drink. 

 i Leave this place  Your Grace.  i  

Leave tonight  I beg you. 

And what is she 

to do for soldiers  

 i We can find sellswords  i  

 i in Pentos and Myr.  i  

Is it  we  already  

Ser Barristan  

If you want to sit on the throne your 

ancestors built  you must win it. 

That will mean blood on your 

hands before the thing is done. 

The blood of my enemies  

not the blood of innocents. 

How many wars have you 

fought in  Ser Barristan  

  Three. 

  Have you ever seen a war 

where innocents didn t die 

by the thousands  

I was in King s Landing 

after the sack  khaleesi. 

You know what I saw  

Butchery. 

Babies  children  old men. 

More women raped 

than you can count. 

There s a beast in every man 

and it stirs when you put 

a sword in his hand. 

But the Unsullied are not men. 

They do not rape. 

They do not put cities to the sword 

unless they re ordered to do so. 

If you buy them  the only men they ll 

kill are those you want dead. 

Do you disagree  Ser Barristan  

When your brother Rhaegar led 

his army into battle at the Trident  

men died for him 

because they believed in him  

because they loved him  

not because they d been bought 

at a slaver s auction. 

I fought beside the last dragon 

on that day  Your Grace. 

I bled beside him. 

Rhaegar fought valiantly  

Rhaegar fought nobly  

and Rhaegar died. 

Did you know him well  

Ser Barristan  

I did  Your Grace. 

Finest man I ever met. 

I wish I had known him. 

But he was not the last dragon. 

All  

Did this one s ears 

mishear  Your Grace  

They did not. 

I want to buy them all. 

There are   Unsullied 

in Astapor. 

Is this what you mean by all  

Yes.  . 

 i And the ones  i  

 i still in training as well.  i  

Master Greizhen says they 

cannot sell half trained boys. 

 i If they fail  i  

 i on the battlefield   i  

they will bring shame 

upon all of Astapor. 

I will have them all 

or take none. 

Many will fall in battle. 

I ll need the boys to pick 

up the swords they drop. 

Master Kraznys says 

you cannot afford this. 

Your ship will buy you 

 Unsullied. 

Because Master Kraznys is generous. 

 i The gold you have left  i  

 i is worth .  i  

But good Master Kraznys 

will give you . 

The Dothraki 

you have with you   

The Dothraki you have are not 

worth what they cost to feed  

 i but Master Kraznys will give  i  

 i you three Unsullied  i  

 i for all of them.  i  

Master Kraznys asks 

how you propose to pay 

for the remaining 

  Unsullied. 

I have dragons. 

I ll give you one. 

You will win the throne 

with dragons  not slaves  Your Grace. 

Khaleesi  please. 

Three dragons. 

  One. 

  Two. 

One. 

 i They want the biggest one.  i  

  Done. 

  Done. 

I ll take you as well  now. 

You ll be Master 

Kraznys  gift to me. 

A token of a bargain 

well struck. 

Khaleesi  a dragon is worth 

more than any army. 

Aegon Targaryen proved that. 

You re both here to advise me. 

I value your advice  

but if you ever question me 

in front of strangers again  

you ll be advising 

someone else. 

Is that understood  

 i Do you have a name   i  

This one s name 

is Missandei  Your Grace. 

Do you have a family  

A mother and a father 

you d return to 

if you had the choice  

No  Your Grace. 

No family living. 

You belong to me now. 

It is your duty to tell me the truth. 

Yes  Your Grace. 

Lying is a great offense. 

Many of those on the Walk of Punishment 

were taken there for less. 

I offered water to one of the slaves 

dying on the Walk of Punishment. 

Do you know what he said to me  

 Let me die.  

There are no masters 

in the grave  Your Grace. 

Is it true what 

Master Kraznys told me 

about the Unsullied  

About their obedience  

All questions have been 

taken from them. 

They obey  that is all. 

 i Once they are yours   i  

 i they are yours.  i  

They will fall on their swords 

if you command it. 

And what about you  

You know that I m taking you to war. 

 i You may go hungry.  i  

 i You may fall sick.  i  

You may be killed. 

 i Valar morghulis.  i  

Yes  all men must die. 

But we are not men. 

 i A surprising place to keep  i  

 i the royal ledgers.  i  

 i I m surprised you re surprised.  i  

This is the safest place 

in the city. 

Not for bastards. 

That s all of them  my lord. 

 i Thank you  my dear.  i  

 i Pod.  i  

Pod. 

Take them outside. 

  I ll be there in a moment. 

  Yes  my lord. 

I hear you owe that boy 

a significant debt. 

Only my life. 

Not all that significant  

I m afraid. 

You should have him knighted. 

If only the Master of Coin 

had such power. 

If only. 

I owe you a significant debt. 

Our redheaded friend. 

You secured her release 

when the queen detained her. 

Oh  that. 

Of course. 

A simple misunderstanding. 

Apparently  Her Grace believed 

that you two had some sort 

of special relationship. 

We don t. 

I did fuck her once. 

  I know. 

  But we don t. 

I know. 

But how would the queen 

get that idea  

Why don t you ask her  

Any advice for me 

on my new position  

Keep a low profile. 

If I had a gold dragon 

for every time I heard 

that joke  I d be richer than you are. 

Well  you are richer than I am. 

Good point. 

They re only numbers. 

Numbers on paper. 

Once you understand that  

it s easy to make them behave. 

Trivial even. 

You want a real challenge  

Try whores. 

I ve tried quite a few. 

Well  lots of work to do. 

Enjoy the Eyrie. 

Come on  I m here later. 

Come on. 

Tonight  then. 

Looks like dull reading. 

You think all reading 

is dull reading. 

It s an opinion I share with 

some of the finest men I know. 

The secret history of the Seven 

Kingdoms is written in these pages. 

Unless Lord Twatbeard 

made up a bunch of numbers 

to hide what he s really up to. 

Unless he made it all up  yes. 

  Podrick  do keep up. 

  Yes  my lord. 

  Podrick. 

  Yes  my lord  

After a long consultation 

with my colleague Ser Bronn  

I finally found 

a suitable reward 

for the services you ve 

provided over and above 

 i what might be  i  

 i considered reasonable.  i  

Tell me  Pod  

have you ever been 

with a woman  

  No  my lord. 

  Wonderful. 

Genna specializes 

in first timers. 

She s not bad with 

second timers  either. 

Uh  my lord... 

A fair enough repayment 

for putting your spear 

through my would be killer s face  

wouldn t you say  

Now  as it happens  

Marei... 

is quite the spear 

handler herself. 

She s here to thank you 

for staying by my side 

as the battle raged 

all around me. 

He s handsome. 

You didn t tell me 

he was handsome. 

Kayla is famous 

from here to Volantis 

in certain circles. 

 i One of four women in the world  i  

who can perform a proper 

Meereenese Knot. 

My lord  I don t even... 

 i She s here to thank you  i  

 i for being a thoroughly  i  

 i respectful fellow  i  

who s never once failed 

to address me as  my lord.  

Be back in time for my supper. 

Pace yourself  lad. 

For years I ve heard 

that Littlefinger 

is a magician. 

Whenever the crown needs money  

he rubs his hands together 

and  poof  mountains of gold. 

Let me guess. 

He s not a magician. 

No. 

  He s stealing it  

  Worse  he s borrowing it. 

What s wrong with that  

We can t afford to pay it back  

that s what s wrong with it. 

The crown owes millions 

to my father. 

Seeing as it s his grandson s 

ass on the throne  

I imagine he ll forgive 

that debt. 

Forgive a debt  my father  

For a man of the world  

you re strangely naive. 

I ve never borrowed 

money before. 

I m not clear on the rules. 

Well... 

 i Ahem   i  

The basic principle is 

I lend you money  

and after an agreed upon 

period of time  

you return it with interest. 

And what if I don t  

Well  you have to. 

But what if I don t  

This is why 

I don t lend you money. 

Anyway  it s not my father 

I m worried about. 

It s the Iron Bank of Braavos. 

We owe them tens of millions. 

If we fail to repay these loans  

the bank will fund our enemies. 

One way or another  

they always get their gold back. 

Ah  the return 

of the conquering hero. 

Does he have a little 

jaunt in his step  

The lad s practically skipping. 

You were gone a long time. 

I trust you got 

your money s worth. 

Or should I say 

my money s worth  

Oh  it was a gift  Podrick. 

This is more than 

I give you in a year. 

He s a squire. 

You don t pay him. 

Oh  then it s much more 

than I give you in a year. 

They wouldn t take it  my lord. 

Maybe they re trying 

to curry some favor 

 i with the new Master of Coin.  i  

Have you ever known a whore 

to turn down gold  

They were happy enough 

to take it when I gave it to them. 

What did you tell them  

I didn t tell them anything. 

  What did you do to them  

  Lots of things. 

And they seemed 

to like these things  

Yes  my lord. 

 i Of course  i  

 i they seemed to like it.  i  

They re paid 

to seem to like it. 

Only they weren t paid. 

What are you saying  

These ladies enjoyed him so much  

they gave him 

the time for free  

Is that what you re telling us  

Sit down  Podrick. 

We re going to need details. 

Copious details. 

Come on  

Come on  

Come on  

Come on. 

Ha  Ha  

You know how we deal 

with runaways here  do you  

Take off his pants. 

No  No  

No  no  no  

I m gonna fuck you 

into the dirt. 

No  please  

No  no  no  

No  don t  

 i No  please   i  

 i No  No   i  

You little bastard. 

Come  my lord. 

You re a long way from home 

and winter is coming. 

I ll take the big bitch first. 

When she s good and wet  

you lot can finish her off. 

 i My lord  I am Brienne of Tarth.  i  

Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me 

to deliver Ser Jaime 

to King s Landing. 

Catelyn Stark s 

a treasonous cunt. 

 i Orders were to take  i  

 i the Kingslayer alive.  i  

Nobody said shit about you. 

You re only making it worse. 

 i Take her over there  i  

 i where it s dark.  i  

I d like a little privacy. 

Come on  

You know who she is  don t you  

A big dumb bitch 

from who cares where. 

Never been with 

a woman that big. 

 i She s Brienne of Tarth.  i  

Her father 

is Lord Selwyn Tarth. 

Heard of Tarth  

 i I m gonna cut your throat   i  

They call it the Sapphire Isle. 

Do you know why  

Every sapphire in Westeros 

was mined on Tarth. 

 i Sapphires are gemstones.  i  

   i The blue ones.  i  

  I know what they are. 

Lord Selwyn would pay 

his daughter s weight 

in sapphires 

if she s returned to him. 

 i But only if she s alive   i  

her honor unbesmirched. 

Bring her back here. 

 i Yes  my lord.  i  

   i Get up.  i  

 i   Come on.  i  

 i Come on  on your feet.  i  

 i Unbesmirched.  i  

Not defiled. 

Fancy word for a fancy man. 

I hated to read as a child  

 i but my father forced me  i  

 i to study the books every morning  i  

 i before I could practice  i  

 i with sword or horse.  i  

Two hours every day holed up in 

the maester s chambers. 

I learned a lot of fancy words. 

I bet you did. 

Your father  

he d pay your weight 

in gold to get you back  

You ll be a rich man 

till the end of your days. 

 i And your sons will be rich men  i  

 i and their sons after them.  i  

Lands  titles   

you ll have them all. 

The North can t win this war. 

You re a smart man. 

You understand that. 

We have the numbers. 

We have the gold. 

Aye  you have both. 

Fighting bravely 

for a losing cause 

is admirable. 

Fighting for a winning cause 

is far more rewarding. 

Hard to argue with that. 

Now that we re speaking 

together man to man  

I wonder if you need 

to keep me chained to this tree. 

I m not asking to be freed 

from my constraints  

but if I could sleep 

lying down  

my back would thank you for it. 

I m not as young 

and resilient as I was once. 

None of us are. 

 i Unchain Ser Jaime  i  

 i from the tree.  i  

 i Come on  men.  i  

Suppose you ll be wanting 

something to eat. 

I m famished  actually. 

 i I think we ve got a spare  i  

 i partridge on the fire.  i  

Well  I do like partridge. 

Bring the bird over here 

and the carving knife. 

Will this work 

as a table  my lord  

Oh  yes. 

Yes  this will do nic   

ah  

On the stump. 

You think you re 

the smartest man there is. 

That everyone alive 

has to bow and scrape 

and lick your boots. 

  My father   

  And if you get in any trouble  

all you ve got to do 

is say  my father  

and that s it  

all your troubles are gone. 

  Don t. 

  Have you got something to say  

Careful. You don t want to say 

the wrong thing. 

You re nothing 

without your daddy  

and your daddy ain t here. 

Never forget that. 

Here  this should 

help you remember. 

 i     All black and brown  i  

 i and covered with hair      i  

 i     Three boys  a goat   i  

 i and a dancing bear      i  

 i     They danced and spun  i  

 i right to the fair      i  

 i     How sweet she was   i  

 i so pure and fair      i  

 i     The maid with honey  i  

 i up in her hair      i  

 i     He smelled her all  i  

 i in the summer air      i  

 i     The maid with honey  i  

 i up in her hair      i  

 i     From there to here   i  

 i from here to there      i  

 i     All black and brown  i  

 i and covered in hair      i  

 i     He smelled that girl  i  

 i in the summer air      i  

   i     The bear  the bear      i  

   i     The maiden fair      i  

 i     Oh  I m a maid  i  

 i and I m pure and fair      i  

 i     I ll never dance  i  

 i with a hairy bear      i  

 i     I called a knight   i  

 i but you re a bear      i  

 i     All black and brown  i  

 i and covered in hair      i  

 i     From there to here   i  

 i from here to there      i  

 i     All black and brown  i  

 i and covered in hair      i  

 i     He smelled that girl  i  

 i in the summer air      i  

   i     The bear  the bear      i  

   i     The maiden fair.      i  

 i You ve seen  i  

 i better days  My Lord.  i  

Another visit  

It seems 

you re my last friend. 

No no  

many still love you. 

Sansa came to court 

this morning 

to plead for your life. 

On her knees  

begging for me  hmmm. 

Did you laugh 

with the others  

You do me wrong  My Lord. 

Your blood is 

the last thing I want. 

I don t know 

what you want. 

I ve given up 

trying to guess. 

When I was still a boy   

before they cut my balls off 

with a hot knife   

I traveled with a group 

of actors through the free cities. 

They taught me that 

each man has a role to play. 

The same is true 

at court. 

I am the master 

of whisperers. 

My role is to be sly  obsequious 

and without scruples. 

I m a good actor  

My Lord. 

Huh. 

Can you free me from this pit  

I could. 

But will I  

No. 

As I said  

I m no hero. 

What do you want  

Tell me. 

No riddles  no stories   

tell me  what do you want  

Peace. 

Did you know that 

your son is marching south 

with an army of Northmen  

Loyal lad   

fighting for 

his father s freedom. 

Robb  

He s just a boy. 

Boys have been 

conquerors before. 

But the man giving Cersei 

sleepless nights 

is the King s   

the late King s brother. 

Lord Stannis has the best 

claim to the Throne  

he is a proven battle commander 

and he is utterly without mercy. 

Stannis Baratheon 

is Robert s true heir. 

The Throne 

is his by rights. 

Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded 

so sweetly for your life  

it would be a shame 

to throw it away. 

Cersei is no fool. 

She knows a tame wolf is more 

use to her than a dead one. 

You want me to serve the 

woman who murdered my King  

who butchered my men  

who crippled my son  

I want you 

to serve the realm  

Tell the Queen you will confess 

your vile treason  

tell your son 

to lay down his sword 

and proclaim Joffrey 

as the true heir. 

Cersei knows you 

as a man of honor. 

If you give her 

the peace she needs 

and promise to carry 

her secret to your grave  

I believe she will allow you to take 

the Black and live out your days 

on the Wall with your brother 

and your bastard son. 

You think my life is 

some precious thing to me  

That I would trade my honor 

for a few more years of... 

Of what  

You grew up with actors. 

You learned their craft 

and you learned it well. 

But I grew up 

with soldiers. 

I learned how to die 

a long time ago. 

Pity. 

 i Such a pity.  i  

What of your 

daughter s life  My Lord  

 i Is that a precious  i  

 i thing to you   i  

It s a birthday message 

to his grand niece Walda. 

Or so Walder Frey 

would have you think. 

Keep shooting them down. 

We can t risk Lord Walder 

sending word of your movements 

to the Lannisters. 

He s grandfather s bannerman. 

We can t expect his support  

Expect nothing of Walder Frey 

and you ll never be surprised. 

Look. 

 i Father rots  i  

 i in a dungeon.  i  

How long before 

they take his head  

We need to cross the Trident 

and we need to do it now. 

Just march up to his gates 

and tell him you re crossing. 

We ve got five times his numbers. 

You can take the Twins if you have to. 

Not in time. Tywin Lannister 

marches north as we speak. 

The Freys have held 

the crossing for  years  

and for  years they have never 

failed to exact their toll. 

Have my horse 

saddled and ready. 

Enter the Twins alone 

and he ll sell you to the Lannis. 

Or throw you in a dungeon. 

Or slit your throat. 

My father would do whatever 

it took to secure our crossing. 

Whatever it took. 

If I m going 

to lead this army  

I can t have other men 

doing my bargaining for me. 

I agree. 

  I ll go. 

  Theon   i You can t   i  

I have known Lord Walder 

since I was a girl. 

He would never 

harm me. 

 i Unless there was  i  

 i a profit in it.  i  

What do you want  

It is a great pleasure to see you 

again after so many years  My Lord. 

Oh spare me. 

Your boy s too proud 

to come before me himself. 

What am I supposed 

to do with you  

Father  you forget yourself. 

Lady Stark is here   

Who asked you  

You re not Lord Frey yet  

not until I die. 

Do I look dead to you  

Father  please   

I need lessons in courtesy 

from you  bastard  

Your mother would still 

be a milkmaid 

if I hadn t squirted you 

into her belly. 

All right  

you come forward. 

There. Now that I ve observed 

the courtesies  

 i perhaps my sons will do me the honor  i  

 i of shutting their mouths.  i  

Is there somewhere 

we can talk  

We re talking 

right now. 

Fine. 

Out  All of you  

You too. 

You see that  

 she is. 

A little flower. 

And her honey s all mine. 

I m sure she will 

give you many sons. 

Huh. Your father didn t 

come to the wedding. 

He is quite ill  My Lord. 

Didn t come to 

the last one either. 

Or the one before that. 

Your family has always 

pissed on me. 

  My Lord  I   

  Don t deny it. You know it s true. 

The fine Lord Tully 

would never marry any 

of his children to mine. 

I m sure there 

were reasons why   

I didn t need reasons. 

I needed to get rid 

of sons and daughters. 

You see how they pile up  

Why are you here  

To ask you 

to open your gates  

My Lord  

so my son and his bannermen may cross 

the Trident and be on their way. 

Why should I let him  

If you could climb 

your own battlements  

you would see that he has 

  men outside your walls. 

They ll be   corpses 

when Tywin Lannister gets here. 

Don t try and frighten me  

Lady Stark. 

Your husband s in a cell 

beneath the Red Keep 

and your son s got no fur 

to keep his balls warm. 

You swore an oath 

to my father. 

Oh yes  I said some words... 

And I swore oaths to the crown too  

if I remember right. 

Joffrey s King now  

which makes your boy 

and his corpses to be nothing 

but rebels  it seems to me. 

If I had the sense 

the Gods gave a fish  

I d hand you both 

over to the Lannisters. 

  Why don t you  

  Stark  Tully  

Lannister  Baratheon  

give me one good reason 

why I should waste 

a single thought on any of you  

 i And... engage. 

When does Aemon think you ll 

be able to use that hand  

  Soon  he says. 

  Good. 

You ll be ready 

for this then. 

I thought a wolf was 

more appropriate for you 

than a bear... 

So I had a new pommel made. 

It s called Longclaw. 

Works as well for a wolf 

as a bear  I think. 

This is Valyrian steel. 

It was my father s sword  

his father before him. 

The Mormonts have carried it 

for five centuries. 

It was meant 

for my son Jorah. 

He brought dishonor 

to our House  

but he had the grace 

to leave the sword 

before he fled 

from Westeros. 

My Lord  you honor me  

but I can t   

Oh  you can 

and you will. 

I wouldn t be standing here if it 

wasn t for you and your beast. 

A bloody dead man 

tried to kill me... 

So you ll take it. 

I ll hear no more about it. 

  Is that understood  

  Yes  My Lord. 

Right. 

Now don t think this means 

I approve 

of this nonsense 

with you 

and Alliser Thorne. 

That s a man s sword  

it ll take 

a man to wield it. 

I ll apologize 

to Ser Alliser tonight. 

No you won t  

I sent him to King s Landing 

yesterday. 

The hand that your wolf 

tore off 

that thing s wrist   

I ve ordered Thorne to lay it 

at the feet of this... 

Boy King. 

That should get young 

Joffrey s attention. 

And it puts 

a thousand leagues 

between you and Thorne. 

Now go and put your sword 

somewhere safe 

and bring me 

my supper. 

Yes  My Lord. 

  Well done. 

  Well done. 

You earned that  Snow. 

Well done. 

Go on  

let s have a look. 

  At what  

  Grenn  The sword  Show us the sword. 

Sword  Sword  

Sword  Sword  

  Let s have a look. 

  Piss off. 

Get off of it. 

Piss off. 

Come on  I want to have 

a look at it in the light. 

Give it here  

What is it  

  I   

  Look at its eyes. 

  Give it. 

  I can t. 

You can t what  

I   I m really not 

supposed to say. 

And yet you really 

want to say. 

You want to say 

that...  

There was a raven. 

I read the message 

to Maester Aemon. 

It s your brother Robb. 

What  

What about him  

He s heading south. 

To war. 

All his bannermen have rallied 

to his side. They ll keep him safe. 

I should be there. 

I should be with him. 

...If we do that  they ll never 

get back across. 

Well  

What did he say  

Lord Walder has granted 

your crossing. 

  His men are yours as well   

  Greatjon  Huh. 

  Less the  he will keep here 

to hold the crossing 

against any who would 

pursue you. 

And what does 

he want in return  

You will be taking on his son 

Olyvar as your personal squire. 

  He expects a knighthood in good time. 

  Fine fine. 

And  

And Arya 

will marry his son Waldron 

   i when they both come of age.  i  

  She won t be happy about that. 

Hmmm. 

And  

And 

when the fighting 

is done... 

You will marry 

one of his daughters. 

 i Whichever you prefer.  i  

He has a number he thinks 

will be... suitable. 

I see. 

Did you get a look at his daughters  

 i I did.  i  

And  

One was... 

Do you consent  

Can I refuse  

Not if you want to cross. 

Then I consent. 

Sam said you wanted 

to see me  

I did indeed. 

Perhaps you would be 

kind enough to assist me. 

Tell me  

did you ever wonder 

why the men 

of The Night s Watch 

take no wives 

and father no children  

No. 

So they will not love. 

 i Love is the death  i  

 i of duty.  i  

If the day should ever come when 

your lord father was forced to choose 

between honor 

on the one hand 

and those he loves 

on the other  

what would he do  

He would do whatever was right. 

No matter what. 

Then Lord Stark 

is one man in  . 

Most of us are not 

so strong. 

What is honor 

compared 

to a woman s love  

 i And what is duty  i  

 i against the feel of a newborn son  i  

 i in your arms   i  

Or a brother s smile  

Sam told you. 

We re all human. 

Oh  we all do our duty when 

there s no cost to it. 

Honor comes easy then. 

Yet sooner or later 

in every man s life 

there comes a day 

when it is not easy  

a day when 

he must choose. 

And this is my day  

Is that what 

you re saying  

Oh  it hurts  boy. 

Oh yes. 

  I know. 

  You do not know  

No one knows. 

I may be a bastard  

but he is my father 

and Robb is my brother. 

The Gods were cruel when they 

saw fit to test my vows. 

They waited till I was old. 

What could I do when the ravens 

brought the news from the South   

the ruin of my House  

the death of my family  

I was helpless  

blind  frail. 

But when I heard 

they had killed 

my brother s son  

and his poor son... 

And the children  

Even the little children. 

Who are you  

My father was Maekar  

the first of his name. 

My brother Aegon 

reigned after him 

when I had refused 

the Throne. 

And he was followed 

by his son Aerys  

whom they called 

the Mad King. 

You re Aemon Targaryen. 

I m a Maester 

of the Citadel  

bound in service to Castle Black 

and The Night s Watch. 

I will not tell you 

to stay or go. 

You must make 

that choice yourself  

and live with it 

for the rest of your days. 

As I have. 

Drogo. 

 i Sajo anni.  i  

Hyah hyah. 

 i Our scouts tell us  i  

 i the Stark host has moved  i  

 i south from the Twins  i  

with Lord Frey s levies 

in tow. 

They re a day s 

march north. 

The boy may lack 

experience and sense  

 i but he does have  i  

 i a certain mindless  i  

  provincial courage. 

  Ah. 

Oh  do continue. 

Didn t mean to interrupt. 

I do hope your savages 

are going to be of some use  

otherwise we ve wasted 

good steel on them. 

The great hairy one insisted he 

must have two battle axes   

heavy black steel  

double sided. 

Shagga likes axes. 

When the battle commences  

you and your wildlings 

 i will be in the vanguard.  i  

  The vanguard  

   i Mm hmm.  i  

Me and the tribesmen 

on the front lines  

 i They do seem  i  

 i rather ferocious.  i  

Ferocious  

Last night 

a Moon brother stabbed 

a Stone Crow over a sausage. 

 i Three Stone Crows seized the Moon  i  

 i brother and opened his throat.  i  

Bronn managed to keep Shagga from 

chopping off the dead man s cock  

which was fortunate  

but even still 

Ulf is demanding 

blood money  

which Shagga and Gunthor 

refuse to pay. 

When soldiers lack discipline  

the fault lies with their commander. 

Surely there are ways 

to have me killed 

that would be less detrimental 

to the war effort. 

There ll be no more 

discussion on the matter. 

It appears I m not 

hungry after all. 

Excuse me  My Lords. 

Where did you find one 

so pretty at this hour  

  I took her. 

  Took her  

  From whom  

  From  uh... 

Ser   what s his name  

I don t know. 

Ginger cunt three tents down. 

 i And he didn t have anything  i  

 i to say about it   i  

He said something. 

Well  the odds of me 

living long enough 

for him to retaliate 

just dropped drastically. 

We ll be at 

the vanguard tomorrow. 

Oh well. 

I... think I ll go 

and find myself one. 

Who are you  

Who would you like me to be  

What did your mother 

call you  

Shae. 

What did your 

mother call you  

My mother died 

giving birth to me. 

Is that why I m here  

So we can talk about our mothers  

  What sort of accent is that  

  Foreign. 

For   

What do you want 

from me  

What do I want from you  

I want you to share my tent. 

I want you to pour my wine  

laugh at my jokes  

rub my legs when they re 

sore after a day s ride. 

I want you to take 

no other man to bed 

for as long 

as we re together. 

And I want you to fuck me 

like it s my last night in this world   

which it may well be. 

And what do I get  

Safety. 

No one will hurt you 

for as long as you re mine. 

The pleasure 

of my company  

which I have heard 

is spectacular. 

Who told you this  

Women you paid  

And three  More gold 

 i than you can spend if you  i  

 i lived a thousand years.  i  

Do you accept my proposal  

Let s start with your last night 

in this world. 

Doth   Dothrae... 

Ki ha   hammi... 

Ish nokitta... 

Qana th... 

 i Khaleesi.  i  

Come. 

He s very strong. 

No one understands 

how strong he is. 

  He will die tonight  Khaleesi. 

  He can t. 

He can t. 

I won t let him. 

Even a Queen doesn t 

have that power. 

We must go quickly. I ve heard 

there s a good port in Asshai   

  I won t leave him. 

  He s already gone  Khaleesi. 

Doth   

Even if   

  Even if he dies  

why would  i I  i  run  

 i I am Khaleesi  i  

and my   my son will be 

Khal after Drogo. 

This isn t Westeros 

where men honor blood. 

Here they only honor strength. 

There will be fighting 

 i after Drogo dies.  i  

Whoever wins that fight 

will be the new Khal. 

He won t want any rivals. 

Your boy will be plucked 

from your breast 

 i and given to the dogs.  i  

I won t leave him. 

The wound 

has festered. 

I think you should wear 

your armor tonight  Ser. 

I think you re right. 

You ve saved me 

once more. 

And now you  i must  i  

save him. 

He s beyond 

the healer s skills. 

All I can do is 

ease his path. 

Save him and I will free you. 

I swear it. 

You must know a way... 

Some... 

Some magic. 

There is a spell. 

Some would say death 

is cleaner. 

Do it. 

Save him. 

There is a price. 

You ll have gold   

whatever you want. 

It s not a matter of gold. 

This is Bloodmagic. 

Only death pays for life. 

My death  

No. 

Not your death  Khaleesi. 

Bring me his horse. 

Khaleesi  

do not do this thing. 

   i Let me kill this witch.  i  

  Kill her and you kill your Khal. 

This is Bloodmagic. 

It is forbidden. 

I am your Khaleesi. 

I tell you what is forbidden. 

Go now  

  Take her and leave. 

  Huh uh. 

Take her  

Irriya  

You must go also  lady. 

 i Once I begin to sing   i  

 i no one must enter the tent.  i  

The dead will 

dance here tonight. 

No one will enter. 

Bring him back to me. 

What have you done  

I have to save him. 

We could have been  miles away from 

here by now on the way to Asshai. 

You would have been safe. 

 i J  ni th vos eo.  i  

Mra qothoon vosaan   

Khaleesi  

Are you hurt  

  The baby... 

  Hmm  

...Is coming. 

  Fetch the midwives. 

  They will not come. 

They say 

she is cursed. 

They ll come or I ll 

have their heads. 

The witch   

she can bring baby. 

I hear her say so. 

Are you in agony  

my lion  

  No. 

  You look like you re in agony. 

The fire is burning 

your pretty soft skin. 

Ahhh. 

Damn you  woman. 

Are you immune to pain  

  Just used to it. 

  Drink. 

Let s play a new game. 

There s a Braavosi knife game 

I could teach you   

Does it involve the potential 

for losing fingers  

  Not if you win. 

  No  

No more fire games  

no knife games. 

Let s do something 

I m good at. 

What are you good at  

I happen to be a great 

judge of character. 

  This sounds like a boring game. 

   i It s not.  i  

 i Here s how it works   i  

 i I make a statement  i  

about your past. 

If I m right  

you drink. 

If I m wrong  I drink. 

And no lying. 

I ll know if you re lying. 

I don t want to play 

this game. 

Fine. 

Bronn first. 

Your father beat you. 

But my mother 

hit harder. 

You killed your first man 

before you were . 

It was a woman. 

She swung 

an axe at me. 

You ve been 

North of the Wall. 

What brought you 

up there  

Work. 

And... 

You once loved a woman 

many years ago  

but it turned out badly so you ve 

never let yourself love again. 

Oh wait  that s me. 

Your turn  my mysterious 

foreign beauty. 

I don t want to play. 

It s fun  

Look at the fun we re having. 

Your mother 

was a whore. 

Drink. 

All right. 

Your father left the family when 

you were very young  

  never to return. 

  Drink. 

And we ve established 

the rules about lying  

Drink  

Mmmm. 

You wanted 

a different life. 

You came from somewhere 

and you wanted to be elsewhere. 

The whole shit stained world 

could drink off that one. 

So specifics   

you wanted to be elsewhere  

but how would you get there  

I don t believe the life 

of the silent sisters is for you. 

So what s 

a lowborn girl to do  

Drink. 

  Are you sure   

  drink  

And don t talk about 

my mother and father ever 

or I will carve your eyes 

from your head. 

My dear lady  if I have 

offended you  I apologize. 

My turn. 

Fine fine. 

Ask away. 

Try to penetrate 

the enigma that is me. 

  Who were you in love with  

  That s not how the game works. 

I don t care the way 

the game works. 

Our Lord here 

used to be married. 

  Married  

  How did you hear that  

You hear lots of things playing 

dice with Lannister soldiers. 

Another night  

perhaps. 

Not another night. 

This night. 

It s not 

a pleasant story. 

  Or maybe I will cry. 

  I m guessing the lady and I 

can tell more unpleasant stories 

than your Lordship. 

So... 

I was . My brother Jaime 

and I were riding 

when we heard a scream. 

She ran out onto the road  

clothes half torn off 

with two men on her heels. 

Jaime scared away the men easily 

enough  while I wrapped her in my cloak. 

She was too scared to send off 

on her own  

so while Jaime 

hunted down the rapers 

I took her to the nearest 

inn and fed her. 

Her name was Tysha. 

She was 

a wheelwright s orphan. 

And she was hungry   

together we finished off 

three chickens and a flagon of wine. 

Impossible as it seems  there was a 

time when I was unaccustomed to wine. 

I forgot how afraid 

I was around girls  

how I was always waiting 

for them to laugh at me 

or look away embarrassed 

or ask me about my tall 

handsome brother. 

I forgot about 

everything but Tysha. 

And somehow I found 

myself in her bed. 

For three chickens  

I should hope so. 

It didn t last long. I didn t know 

what the hell I was doing. 

But she was good to me. 

She kissed me afterwards 

and sang me a song. 

And by morning I was deep enough 

in love to ask for her hand. 

A few lies  a few gold coins  

one drunken Septon 

and there you have it   

man and wife. 

For a fortnight anyway  

until the Septon sobered up 

and told my father. 

I imagine that was 

the end of all that. 

Not quite. 

First  my father had 

Jaime tell me the truth. 

The girl was a whore  

you see. 

Jaime had arranged 

the whole thing  

the road  the rapers   

all of it. 

He thought it was time 

I had a woman. 

 i After my brother confessed   i  

my father brought in my wife 

and gave her 

to his guards. 

 i He paid her well    i  

 i a silver for each man.  i  

How many whores command 

that kind of price  

He brought me into the barracks 

and made me watch. 

By the end  

she had so much silver 

that the coins were 

slipping through her fingers 

and rolling 

onto the floor. 

I would have killed the man 

who did that to me. 

You should have known 

she was a whore. 

Really  

I was   drunk 

and in love   

A girl who 

was almost raped 

doesn t invite another man 

into her bed two hours later. 

As I said  I was 

young and stupid. 

You are still 

young and stupid. 

Hyah  

What is it  

What do you want  

You re sleeping 

through the war. 

  What  

  They stole a night s march on us. 

They re a mile north. 

   i Get my squire   i  

  You don t have a squire. 

If I die  weep for me. 

You ll be dead. 

How will you know  

I ll know. 

Watch out  

Move  

Out of the way  

  Move aside  

    Neighs 

stay low. 

Stay low  

If you re lucky  

no one will notice you. 

I was born lucky. 

Tribesmen of the Vale  

gather round  

Stone Crows  

Black Ears  

Burned Men  

  Moon brothers  

  Man   i And painted dogs   i  

And painted dogs  

Your dominion over 

the Vale begins now  

Onward to claim 

what is yours  

Half man  Half man  

Half man  

Half man  

Half man  Half man  

To battle. 

 i You re a shit warrior.  i  

I m alive  

You re alive. 

Did we win  

We wouldn t be having 

this conversation if we didn t. 

How did our 

tribesmen do  

Yeah  good. 

 i It s nice to see them  i  

 i getting along.  i  

 i You re wounded.  i  

Good of you to notice. 

I hear we won. 

Hmph. 

The scouts were wrong. 

There were   

Stark bannermen  not  . 

Did we get the Stark boy  

at least  

He wasn t here. 

Where was he  

With his other   men. 

And where are they  

  We should go  My Lady. 

  No  

My Lady  

Hyah hyah  

By the time they knew what was 

happening  it had already happened. 

Lady Stark. 

I d offer you my sword  

but I seem 

to have lost it. 

It s not your sword I want. 

Give me my daughters back. 

Give me my husband. 

I ve lost them too  

I m afraid. 

 i Kill him  Robb.  i  

 i Send his head to his father.  i  

He cut down  of our men   

you saw him. 

He s more use 

to us alive than dead. 

Take him away 

and put him in irons. 

We could end this war 

right now  boy  

save thousands of lives. 

You fight for the Starks  

I fight for the Lannisters. 

Swords or lances  teeth  nails   

choose your weapons 

and let s end this 

here and now. 

If we do it your way  

Kingslayer  

you d win. 

We re not doing it 

your way. 

Come on  pretty man. 

I sent   men 

to their graves today. 

The bards will sing songs 

of their sacrifice. 

Aye. But the dead 

won t hear them. 

One victory does not 

make us conquerors. 

Did we free my father  

Did we rescue my sisters 

from the Queen  

Did we free the North from those 

who want us on our knees  

This war is far from over. 

Could I have one  

A lemon one   

or any of them. 

Three coppers. 

How about 

a nice fat pigeon  

Piss off now. 

Go on. 

Do you have any stale ones 

from yesterday  

  Or any burnt ones  

  Piss off  

Hey  where s everyone going  

What s happening  

They re taking him 

to the Sept of Baelor. 

Who  

The Hand of the King. 

  Traitor  

  Coward  

Baelor. 

Baelor  

Traitor  

Traitor  

I am Eddard Stark  

Lord of Winterfell 

and Hand of the King. 

I come before you 

to confess my treason 

 i in the sight of Gods  i  

 i and men.  i  

 i I betrayed the faith  i  

 i of my King  i  

and the trust 

of my friend Robert. 

I swore to protect 

and defend his children  

but before his blood 

was cold 

 i I plotted  i  

 i to murder his son...  i  

And seize the Throne 

for myself. 

Traitor  

Let the high Septon 

and Baelor the blessed 

bear witness to what I say  

Joffrey Baratheon 

is the one true heir 

to the Iron Throne  

 i by the Grace  i  

 i of all the gods   i  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms 

and Protector 

of the Realm. 

As we sin  

so do we suffer. 

This man has 

confessed his crimes 

in sight 

of Gods and men. 

The Gods are just 

but beloved Baelor 

taught us 

they can also be 

merciful. 

What is to be done 

with this traitor  

Your Grace  

My mother wishes me to let 

Lord Eddard join The Night s Watch. 

Stripped of all titles 

and powers  

he would serve the realm 

in permanent exile. 

And My Lady Sansa 

 i has begged mercy  i  

 i for her father.  i  

But they have 

the soft hearts of women. 

So long as I am your King  

 i treason shall never  i  

 i go unpunished.  i  

Ser Ilyn  

bring me his head  

No  Stop  

Daddy  

Someone stop him  

My son  this is madness. 

 i Put him down   i  

  Don t look  

  Let me go. 

  Let me go  

  Shut your mouth. Look at me. 

  Look at me  

  Stop  Daddy  

  Stop  No no  

  Crowd  Traitor  

 i Stop   i  

Stop him  stop  

Clegane  look into the flames. 

What do you see  

A wall of ice. 

The Wall. 

The only thing standing 

between us 

and the army of the dead 

is the Wall  

and the Wall hasn t been 

properly manned in centuries. 

Last time we saw The Night King  

it was at Hardhome. 

Closest castle to Hardhome 

is Eastwatch by the sea. 

And that s where I ll go. 

Looks like we re 

the Nightswatch now. 

This suits you  Lady Stark. 

  Jon left you in charge  

  He did. 

  Lord Tarly. 

  I believe you know my son. 

Do you fight with us... 

or with the foreign savages 

and eunuchs  

What do you think I should do  

If you use them to melt castles 

and burn cities  

you re not different. 

You re just more of the same. 

Listen. 

You could ve killed me. 

The fuck were you doing 

back there  

Ending the war. 

Killing her. 

You saw the dragon 

between you and her  

And  

Listen to me  cunt. 

Till I get what I m owed  

a dragon doesn t 

get to kill you  

you don t get to kill you  

only I get to kill you. 

That was only one of them. 

She has two more. 

If she decides to use them  

to really use them... 

  You re fucked. 

  Don t you mean we re fucked  

No  I do not. 

Dragons are where 

our partnership ends. 

I m not gonna be around 

when those things 

start spitting fire 

on King s Landing. 

I have to tell Cersei. 

May as well jump 

back in that river. 

I know what Cersei has told you. 

That I ve come 

to destroy your cities  

burn down your homes  

murder you  

and orphan your children. 

That s Cersei Lannister  not me. 

I m not here to murder  

and all I want to destroy 

is the wheel that has 

rolled over rich and poor 

to the benefit of no one but the 

Cersei Lannisters of the world. 

I offer you a choice   

bend the knee and join me. 

Together  we will leave the world 

a better place than we found it. 

Or refuse... 

and die. 

Step forward  my lord. 

You will not kneel  

I already have a queen. 

My sister. 

She wasn t your queen 

until recently  though  was she  

When she murdered 

your rightful queen 

and destroyed House Tyrell 

for all time. 

So it appears your allegiances 

are somewhat flexible. 

There are 

no easy choices in war. 

Say what you will 

about your sister  

she was born in Westeros. 

She s lived here all her life. 

You  on the other hand  

murdered your own father 

and chose to support 

a foreign invader. 

One with no ties to this land... 

with an army of savages 

at her back. 

You will not trade 

your honor for your life. 

I respect that. 

Perhaps he could take 

the Black  Your Grace. 

Whatever else he is  

he is a true soldier. 

He d be invaluable at the Wall. 

You cannot send me to the Wall. 

You are not my queen. 

You will have to kill me  too. 

Step back and shut your mouth. 

Who are you  

A stupid boy. 

I am Dickon Tarly  

son of Randyll Tarly. 

You are the future 

of your house. 

This war has already wiped one 

great house from the world. 

Don t let it happen again. 

Bend the knee. 

I will not. 

Your Grace  nothing scrubs 

bold notions from a man s head 

like a few weeks in a dark cell. 

I meant what I said. 

I m not here 

to put men in chains. 

If that becomes an option  

many will take it. 

I gave them a choice. 

They made it. 

Your Grace  if you start 

beheading entire families   

I m not beheading anyone. 

Your Grace. 

Lord Randyll 

Tarly  Dickon Tarly  

I  Daenerys of House 

Targaryen  First of My Name  

Breaker of Chains  

and Mother of Dragons  

sentence you to die. 

Dracarys. 

My   my lord... 

How many men did we lose  

We haven t done 

a full accounting. 

It s not only armies 

that win wars. 

We have the Tyrell gold  we 

have the Iron Bank behind us. 

We can buy mercenaries. 

Not the same as our men  

but they ll fight 

if they re well paid  

which they will be. 

I just saw the Dothraki fight. 

They ll beat any mercenary army. 

They ll beat any army 

I ve ever seen. 

Killing our men wasn t war 

for them  it was sport. 

Her dragon burnt 

a thousand wagons. 

Qyburn s scorpion fired 

bolts bigger than you. 

They couldn t stop it. 

And she has three of them. 

This isn t a war we can win. 

So  what do we do  

Sue for peace  

I sit on her father s throne  

the father you betrayed 

and murdered. 

And in her mind  she s winning. 

What sort of offer 

do you think she d make  

Maybe we can count on Tyrion 

to intercede on our behalf 

by way of apology for 

murdering our father and son. 

He didn t. 

You saw the crossbow  

you saw his body. 

I m not talking about Father. 

Tyrion didn t kill Joffrey. 

He had nothing to do with it. 

  After all this time  it still amazes me that you   

  It was Olenna. 

She confessed before she died. 

And this was before or after 

she drank the poison 

you so kindly provided her  

After. 

And you believed her  

If you were Olenna  

would you rather have seen 

your granddaughter married 

to Joffrey or Tommen  

Which one would Margaery have 

been better able to control  

Which one would have made Olenna 

the true ruler 

of the Seven Kingdoms  

She was telling the truth. 

I shouldn t have 

listened to you. 

She should have died screaming. 

She s dead  like her son  

her grandchildren  

her whole house. 

And if we don t find a way out 

of this war  we ll follow them. 

So we fight and die 

or we submit and die. 

I know my choice. 

A soldier should know his. 

They re beautiful  aren t they  

It wasn t the word 

I was thinking of  but... 

but  yes  they are. 

Gorgeous beasts. 

They re not beasts to me. 

No matter how big they get 

or how terrifying 

to everyone else  

they re my children. 

You weren t gone long. 

No. 

And  

And I have fewer enemies 

today than I did yesterday. 

You re not sure 

how you feel about that. 

No  I m not. 

How many men did your army kill 

taking Winterfell back 

from the Boltons  

Thousands. 

We both want to help people. 

We can only help them 

from a position of strength. 

Sometimes strength is terrible. 

When you first came here  

Ser Davos said you took a knife 

in the heart for your people. 

Ser Davos gets carried away. 

So  it was a figure of speech  

Your Grace. 

Jon Snow  this is 

Ser Jorah Mormont  

an old friend. 

I served with your father. 

He was a great man. 

You look strong. 

You found a cure  

I wouldn t be here if I hadn t. 

I return to your 

service  my queen  

if you ll have me. 

It would be my honor. 

Ravens. 

We need to send ravens. 

I put very little stock 

in it myself. 

Prophecies of doom 

are never in short supply  

especially when winter comes. 

I remember Wolkan. 

A little timid  

but a sharp mind. 

Eh  the North has dulled 

many good maesters  wits. 

Hard to say whether 

it s the cold  the drink  

or the company. 

A crippled boy 

claims to have seen 

dead men on the march 

beyond the Wall  

thanks to the magical help 

of a raven with three eyes  

Yes  it is a bit much. 

  Still  we ought to write back   

  Brandon Stark. 

  The crippled boy. 

  Do you know him  

I led him through 

the Wall years ago. 

I saw him go beyond the Wall. 

And  

Somehow  a crippled boy 

survived for years beyond the 

Wall when no one else could. 

Not the Night s Watch  

not the wildlings  no one. 

Perhaps we ought to listen 

to what he has to say. 

Perhaps you need more scribing 

work to discipline your mind. 

I sense a more detailed 

proposal is forthcoming  

Everyone in Westeros 

trusts and respects you. 

If you tell people the threat 

is real  they ll believe it. 

If you advise all the lords 

to send their men north 

to hold the Wall  they ll do it. 

And if you tell every 

maester in the Citadel 

to search every word 

of every faded scroll 

about the Long Night  

they may find something 

that lets us defeat 

the Army of the Dead for good. 

It could be done. 

And this news 

could be authentic. 

It s possible. 

It s also possible 

that this message 

is part of a ploy 

by the Dragon Queen 

to lure southern armies away from the 

lands they are currently defending 

to open those lands 

to easy conquest. 

That does seem far more likely 

than magic birds 

talking to cripples. 

Archmaester  please. 

It s real. 

I ve seen it. 

We will write to Maester Wolkan 

at Winterfell for clarification. 

I promise you we will get to the 

truth of it one way or another. 

  Archmaester  please   

  That will be all  Tarly. 

It brings to mind the 

work of Jenny of Oldstones  

the charlatan who claimed descent 

from the children of the forest. 

Don t forget the prophet Lodos  

who promised that the Drowned God would 

rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror. 

Ah  Lodos. 

Is he the one whose father and 

brother were just burnt alive  

I m afraid so. 

Horrible business. 

I haven t had the heart 

to tell him yet. 

He s a good lad. 

Right. 

The ravenry was falling apart 

the last time I checked. 

All rulers demand 

that people bend the knee. 

That s why they re rulers. 

She gave Tarly a choice  

a man who had taken up 

arms against her. 

What else could she do  

Not burn him alive 

alongside his son  

I am her Hand  not her head. 

I can t make 

her decisions for her. 

That s what I used to tell 

myself about her father. 

I found the traitors  but I wasn t 

the one burning them alive. 

I was only a purveyor 

of information. 

It s what I told myself when I 

watched them beg for mercy   

I m not the one doing it. 

When the pitch of their 

screams rose higher   

I m not the one doing it. 

When their hair caught fire 

and the smell of their burning 

flesh filled the throne room   

I m not the one doing it. 

Daenerys is not her father. 

And she never will be 

with the right counsel. 

You need to find a way 

to make her listen. 

  Who s that for  

  Jon Snow. 

Did you read it  

It s a sealed scroll 

for the King in the North. 

What s it say  

Nothing good. 

I thought Arya was dead. 

I thought Bran was dead. 

I m happy for you. 

You don t look happy. 

Bran saw the Night King 

and his army 

marching towards Eastwatch. 

If they make it past the Wall... 

The Wall has kept them out for 

thousands of years  presumably. 

I need to go home. 

You said you don t 

have enough men. 

We ll fight 

with the men we have. 

Unless you ll join us. 

And give the country to Cersei  

As soon as I march away  

she marches in. 

Perhaps not. 

Cersei thinks the Army of the 

Dead is nothing but a story 

made up by wet nurses 

to frighten children. 

What if we prove her wrong  

I don t think she ll come see 

the dead at my invitation. 

So bring the dead to her. 

I thought that was what 

we were trying to avoid. 

We don t have to 

bring the whole army. 

Only one soldier. 

Is that possible  

The first wight I ever saw 

was brought into Castle 

Black from beyond the Wall. 

Bring one of these things 

down to King s Landing 

and show her the truth. 

Anything you bring back 

will be useless 

unless Cersei 

grants us an audience 

and is somehow convinced 

not to murder us 

the moment we set foot 

in the capital. 

The only person 

she listens to is Jaime. 

He might listen to me. 

And how would you get 

into King s Landing  

I can smuggle you in  

but if the gold cloaks 

were to recognize you  

I m warning you  

I m not a fighter. 

Well  it will all be for nothing 

if we don t have 

one of these dead men. 

Fair point. 

How do you propose to find one  

With the queen s permission  

I ll go north and take one. 

You asked me to find a 

cure so I could serve you. 

Allow me to serve you. 

The Free Folk will help us. 

They know the real north 

better than anyone. 

They won t follow Ser Jorah. 

They won t have to. 

You can t lead a raid 

beyond the Wall. 

You re not in the Night s Watch 

anymore  you re King in the North. 

I m the only one here 

who s fought them. 

I m the only one here 

who knows them. 

I haven t given you 

permission to leave. 

With respect  Your Grace  

I don t need your permission. 

I am a king. 

And I came here 

knowing that you could 

have your men behead me 

or your dragons burn me alive. 

I put my trust 

in you  a stranger  

because I knew it was the 

best chance for my people  

for all our people. 

Now I m asking you 

to trust in a stranger... 

because it s our best chance. 

The King in the North 

should stay in the North. 

We did not choose you 

to rule us  my lady. 

But perhaps we should have. 

The Knights of the Vale came 

here for you  Lady Stark. 

Aye. 

You are very kind  my lords. 

But Jon is our king. 

He is doing what 

he thinks is best. 

I warned Jon this would happen. 

That he couldn t leave the North 

and expect it to just sit 

and wait for him like Ghost. 

He didn t. He trusted 

you to hold it for him. 

Well  he s not making it easy. 

The Northern lords are proud. 

These are Mother 

and Father s chambers. 

And  

Nothing. 

Don t do that. 

  What  

  Say what you mean. 

You always liked nice things. 

They made you feel 

better than everyone. 

Are you angry with me  

They were insulting Jon  

and you sat there and listened. 

I listened to their complaints  

which is my responsibility 

as Lady of Winterfell. 

Their opinions 

are important to you. 

Glover has  men  

Royce has  . 

Offend them 

and Jon loses his army. 

Not if they lose 

their heads first. 

Winterfell didn t just 

fall into our hands. 

We took it back  

and the Mormonts 

and the Hornwoods 

and the wildlings and the Vale. 

All of us  working together. 

Now  I m sure cutting off 

heads is very satisfying  

but that s not the way you 

get people to work together. 

And if Jon doesn t come back  

you ll need their support... 

so you can work together 

to give you 

what you really want. 

How can you even think 

such a horrible thing  

You re thinking it right now. 

You don t want to be  

but the thought 

just won t go away. 

I have work to do. 

My lady. 

Last time I was here  I killed 

my father with a crossbow. 

Last time I was here  you 

killed my son with wildfire. 

There s a path to the left 

that hugs the cliff. 

The guards 

hardly ever patrol it. 

Too many steps. 

You re not staying here  

I ve got my own business 

in Flea Bottom. 

What if someone takes the boat  

Then we re fucked. 

Best hurry. 

We don t have time for this. 

We should be preparing 

the city for a siege. 

The Dothraki are coming. 

All the more reason 

for you to train. 

Unless you plan on fighting 

Dothraki  year olds. 

Well  I seem to recall them giving 

you a bit of trouble as well. 

And here I am  ready to train. 

Why down here  

I don t think 

you want people to see 

how you look swinging 

that thing yet. 

Today might be the day 

I kill you by accident. 

Oh  you won t be 

swinging it at me. 

I ll leave you to it. 

I needed to see you. 

And I knew you d 

never agree to meet. 

You made me look 

like a complete fool. 

I thought I d surprise you 

by hitting Casterly Rock  

but you were 

three steps ahead of me. 

Abandoned the family home  

completely unsentimental. 

Father would have been proud. 

  Don t talk about Father. 

  Listen to me   

I once told Bronn 

that if I ever saw you 

again  I d cut you in half. 

It ll take you a while 

with a sparring sword. 

He was going to execute me. 

He knew I was innocent. 

He didn t hate me 

because of anything I did  

he hated me 

because of what I am. 

A little monster 

sent to punish him. 

Did he   

did he think   

did he think I wanted 

to be born this way  

  Did he think I chose it   

  What do you want   

Daenerys will win this war. 

You re a military man. 

You must know there s 

no way around that. 

Daenerys is not her father. 

She s even willing 

to suspend the hostilities 

if Cersei agrees 

to certain terms. 

If you want Cersei 

to bend the knee  

you can ask her yourself. 

I   I don t. 

And Daenerys doesn t. 

Not right now  anyway. 

She has a more 

important request. 

I wasn t sure I d find you. 

Thought you might 

still be rowing. 

I looked in shops  

taverns  brothels. 

Should have known to come 

straight to the Street of Steel. 

Aren t you worried 

about the gold cloaks  

Haven t been here in years. 

Why should they recognize me  

Sometimes I hardly do. 

Nothing fucks you 

harder than time. 

Anybody give you any trouble  

Here I am  arming Lannisters  

and I never get a second look. 

But you were right. 

Safest place for me was 

right under the queen s nose. 

Don t be so sure. 

Safety is never a permanent 

state of affairs. 

Bad things are coming. 

You came to get me. 

You want me to come with you. 

Well  the thing you need to 

understand is   

I m ready. 

  You   

  Let s go. 

You should know 

what you re heading into. 

What do you think 

I ve been thinking about 

with every swing of the hammer  

How happy I am making weapons 

for the family 

that killed my father  

The family that 

tried to kill me  

I ve been getting ready. 

I never knew what for  

but I ve always known 

I d know it when it comes. 

You might want to bring 

one of those swords. 

I don t know much 

about swinging swords. 

But this... 

this I know. 

Keep your father s name 

to yourself. 

Situation s complicated 

enough already. 

Well  who should I say I am  

I told you  Clovis  if we 

don t get out of here soon  

  someone s going to   

  You there  

No weapons  friends. 

I promise. 

What can I do for you  

  Is that your boat  

  It is. 

  The docks are that way. 

  That they are. 

I try to stay away from them 

to avoid good men 

such as yourselves. 

  Still five gold dragons  

  Are you joking  

You must be even older 

than you look. 

  . 

Apiece. 

I can t say it was a pleasure 

doing business with you. 

What s in the boat  

Not more gold. 

  Wine  

  Mm. 

  I like wine. 

  Or hams. 

Come have a look. 

  Fermented crab. 

  What  

Fermented crab. 

One bucket of this triples a 

brothel s earnings for the week. 

A man thinks he s done. 

He s ready to go back 

to his loving family. 

But before he gets 

his breeches up  

his lady of the hour pops a tiny 

spoon of that into his mouth. 

Five minutes later  

he s back in the race. 

Here  have a taste. 

I d hurry to your 

favorite establishment  

or you ll put a hole 

in that chainmail. 

Oi  dwarf  

I really wouldn t try any more 

until you see how 

the first bite hits you. 

That dwarf... 

Where d you get that scar  

Fish hook. Some men 

you just can t teach. 

We was looking for a dwarf with 

a scar like that a while back. 

Perhaps there s 

some arrangement  

Arrangement  

You gonna arrange to pay us 

more than Queen Cersei   

This is Gendry. 

He ll do. 

Go  go  go. 

I could give you something. 

That won t be necessary. 

Ser Jaime. 

Why was Qyburn here  

He s the Hand of the Queen. 

Why are you here  

I met with Tyrion. 

What did our brother 

have to say  

Daenerys wants to meet. 

To discuss her surrender  

To discuss an armistice. 

She s just won a great victory. 

Why would she want a truce now  

Because an army of dead men 

is marching 

on the Seven Kingdoms. 

Tyrion claims he ll have proof. 

  Are you going to punish him  

  Tyrion  

Bronn. 

He betrayed you. 

He set up a meeting without 

your knowledge or consent. 

Do you think 

anything of importance 

happens in this city 

without me knowing  

You let it happen. 

Why  

I ve come to believe that 

an accommodation 

with the Dragon Queen 

could be in our 

immediate interest. 

She has the numbers. If we want to 

beat her  we have to be clever. 

We have to fight her 

like Father would have. 

Dead men  dragons  

and Dragon Queens... 

Whatever stands in our way  

we will defeat it. 

For ourselves  for our house  

for this. 

Who will you say is the father  

You. 

People won t like that. 

Do you remember what Father 

used to say about people  

The lion does not concern himself 

with the opinions of the sheep. 

Never betray me again. 

We re leaving today. 

  The king s got a lot on his mind. 

  I understand. 

He doesn t need to be thinking about 

harboring the bastard of a dead king. 

  You don t have to worry. 

  You re just Clovis  

a smith who s come 

to pay his respects 

before he heads off to work 

at the Winterfell forges. 

Understood. 

Begging your pardon  Your Grace. 

You survived King s Landing. 

Yet again. Your 

Grace  this is Clo   

Name s Gendry  Your Grace. 

I m Robert Baratheon s son. 

Bastard son. 

He was meant 

to keep that to himself. 

Our fathers trusted each other. 

Why shouldn t we  

I saw your father once 

at Winterfell. 

I met yours in my shop. 

  You re a lot leaner. 

  And you re a lot shorter. 

I grew up on stories about them. 

All I ever knew is that 

they fought together and won. 

Ser Davos told me where you re 

going  Your Grace  and why. 

Let me come with you. 

Don t be a fool. 

You re not a soldier. 

No  but I m a fighter. 

And he won t be needing a 

smith with a sword like that. 

You know how to use one  

Well  that s a problem. 

I prefer a hammer. 

He can handle himself. 

We could use the help. 

As my father used to say  

 It s better to be 

a coward for a minute  

than dead for 

the rest of your life.  

I owe you my life. 

Twice over. 

But if what you said is true 

about what s up there  

I can t wait out this war. 

Yeah  nobody mind me. 

All I ve ever done 

is live to a ripe old age. 

All right  come on. 

You may not believe it  

but I ve missed you  Mormont. 

Nobody glowers quite like you. 

Not even Grey Worm. 

This is the coin 

the slaver gave me 

when I suggested he free us 

and pay us  remember  

It was supposed to last us 

the rest of our lives. 

Take it with you. 

But bring it back. 

Our queen needs you. 

We should be better 

at saying farewell by now. 

Your Grace  I... 

If I don t return  at least 

you won t have to deal 

with the King 

in the North anymore. 

I ve grown used to him. 

I wish you good fortune in the 

wars to come  Your Grace. 

Heave  

Do you know how many 

steps there are in the Citadel  

No. 

 . 

Guess how many windows are 

in the Great Sept of Baelor. 

None anymore. 

That s true. 

This High Septon Maynard  

he recorded everything. 

He even recorded 

his own bowel movements. 

What does  annulment  mean  

It s when a man 

sets aside his lawful wife. 

Maynard says here that he issued 

an annulment for a Prince  Ragger  

and remarried him to someone 

else at the same time 

in a secret ceremony in Dorne. 

Is that a common thing 

in the south or    

These maesters... 

they set me to the task of preserving 

that man s window counting 

and annulments and bowel 

movements for all eternity  

while the secret to 

defeating the Night King s 

probably sitting on some dusty shelf 

somewhere  completely ignored. 

But that s all right  isn t it  

We can all become slavering  murderous 

imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate 

as long as we can have access 

to the full records 

of High Septon Maynard s 

  shits  

Steps. 

That number was the steps. 

Are you sure 

you want to do this  

You always wanted 

to be a maester. 

I m tired of reading about 

the achievements of better men. 

I found it  my lord. 

It  uh  took some searching. 

Maester Luwin s archives 

are very thorough. 

You re sure this is the 

only copy in Winterfell  

Uh  yes  my lord. 

Lady Stark thanks you 

for your service. 

Isn t it your 

job to talk him out 

of stupid fucking 

ideas like this  

I ve been failing 

at that job of late. 

How many queens are there now  

Two. 

And you need to convince 

the one with the dragons 

or the one who 

fucks her brother  

Both. 

How many men did you bring  

Not enough. 

The big woman  

We were hoping some of 

your men could help. 

  Hmm. 

  I ll be staying behind. 

I m a liability out there  

as you well know. 

You are. 

You really want to go out there  

Again  

You re not the only ones. 

My scouts found them 

a mile south of the Wall. 

Said they were 

on their way here. 

You re the Hound. 

I saw you once at Winterfell. 

They want to go 

beyond the Wall  too. 

We don t want to go beyond 

the Wall  we have to. 

Our Lord told us that 

the Great War is coming   

Don t trust him. 

Don t trust any of them. 

They re the Brotherhood. 

And the last thing 

their lord told them to do 

was sell me to a red witch 

to be murdered. 

Thoros  

I hardly recognized you. 

Ser Jorah Mormont. 

They won t give me anything 

to drink down here. 

I haven t been feeling 

like myself. 

You re a fucking Mormont  

Like the last Lord Commander  

He was my father. 

He hunted us like animals. 

You returned the favor  

as I recall. 

Here we all are 

at the edge of the world 

at the same moment  

heading in the same direction 

for the same reason. 

Our reasons aren t your reasons. 

It doesn t matter 

what we think our reasons are. 

There s a greater 

purpose at work. 

And we serve it together  

whether we know it or not. 

We may take the steps  

but the Lord of Light   

For fuck s sake  

will you shut your hole  

Are we coming with you or not  

Don t you want to know 

what we re doing  

Is it worse than sitting in a 

freezing cell  waiting to die  

He s right. 

We re all on the same side. 

How can we be  

We re all breathing. 

Your pardon  Your Grace. 

I would rise  but... 

 i Do you know what  i  

 i your wife has done   i  

She did nothing 

I did not command. 

Who d have thought 

she had it in her  

By what right dare you lay 

hands on my blood  

I am the King s Hand  charged 

with keeping the peace... 

You  i were  i  the King s Hand. 

You shall now be held 

accountable. 

Oh  will both of you 

shut your mouths   

Catelyn will release Tyrion and 

you ll make your peace with Jaime. 

He butchered my men   

Lord Stark was 

returning drunk 

from a brothel 

when his men attacked Jaime. 

  Quiet  woman. 

   i Jaime has fled the city.  i  

Give me leave to bring him 

back to justice. 

I took you for a King. 

  Hold your tongue. 

   i He s attacked  i  

one of my brothers 

and abducted the other. 

I should wear the armor 

and you the gown. 

I shall wear this 

like a badge of honor. 

Wear it in silence 

or I ll honor you again. 

See what she does to me  

My loving wife. 

I should not have 

hit her. 

That was not... 

That was not Kingly. 

If we don t act  

there will be a war. 

So tell your wife to return 

that little shit of an Imp 

to King s Landing. 

She s had her fun  

now put an end to it. 

You hear me  

Send a raven and put an end to it. 

And what about 

Jaime Lannister  

  What about Jaime  

  I m half a Kingdom in debt 

to his bloody father. 

I don t know what happened between 

you and those yellow haired shits. 

I don t want to know. 

This is what matters   

I can t rule the Kingdoms 

if the Starks and the Lannisters 

are at each other s throats. 

So enough. 

As you command  

Your Grace. 

With your leave  

I will return to Winterfell 

and set matters straight. 

Piss on that. 

Send a raven. 

I want you to stay. 

I m the King. 

I get what I want. 

I never loved my brothers. 

A sad thing for a man 

to admit  but it s true. 

You were the brother 

I chose. 

We ll talk when I return 

from the hunt. 

The hunt  

Killing things 

clears my head. 

You ll have to sit on the 

throne while I m away. 

You ll hate it more than I do. 

The Targaryen girl   

seven hells  

don t start with her again. 

The girl will die 

and I ll hear no more of it. 

Put on the badge. 

And if you ever take it off again  

I swear to the mother I ll pin the 

damned thing on Jaime Lannister. 

Khaleesi  

Oh  Khaleesi  

You re hurt. 

  Not too fast. 

  Come on  Dancer. 

When are you gonna 

tell him  

Not now. 

  Blood for blood. 

  Bran  Come on  

You need to make the Lannisters 

pay for Jory and the others. 

  Robb   i You re talking about war.  i  

   i I m talking about justice.  i  

Only the Lord of Winterfell 

can call in the bannermen 

and raise an army. 

A Lannister put his spear 

through your father s leg. 

The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock 

where no one can touch him   

you want me to march 

on Casterly Rock  

  You re not a boy anymore. 

  Bran   i Come on.  i  

They attacked your father. 

They ve already started the war. 

It s your duty to represent your 

House when your father can t. 

And it s not your duty  

because it s not your House. 

Where s Bran  

I don t know. 

It s not my House. 

Robb  

All alone in the deep  

dark woods. 

I m not alone. 

My brother is with me. 

I don t see him. 

Got him hidden 

under your cloak  

Ooh  that s a pretty pin. 

  Silver. 

  We ll take the pin 

and the horse. 

Get down. 

Be quick about it. 

I can t. 

The saddle   

the straps. 

What s wrong with you  

You some kind of cripple  

I m Brandon Stark 

of Winterfell. 

If you don t let me be  

I ll have you all killed  

Cut his little cock off 

and stuff it in his mouth. 

The boy s 

worth nothing dead. 

Benjen Stark s 

own blood  

 i Think what Mance  i  

 i would give us.  i  

Piss on Mance Rayder 

and piss on the North. 

We re going as far South 

as South goes. 

There ain t no White Walkers 

down in Dorne. 

Drop the knife  

Let him go and I ll let you live. 

Robb. 

  Robb. 

  Shut up. 

Drop the blade  

  No  don t. 

  Do it. 

Are you all right  

Yes. 

It doesn t hurt. 

Tough little lad. 

 i In the Iron Islands  you re not a man  i  

 i until you ve killed your first enemy.  i  

Well done. 

Have you lost your mind  

What if you d missed  

He would have killed you 

and cut Bran s throat. 

  You don t have the right   

  To what  to save your brother s life  

It was the only thing 

to do  so I did it. 

What about her  

Give me my life  

My Lord  and I m yours. 

We ll keep her alive. 

Mord  

Turnkey  

Mord  

Mord  

Dwarf man 

making noise  

How would you like 

to be rich  

Dwarf man still 

making noise. 

My family is rich. 

We have gold  

lots of gold. 

I m prepared to give you 

lots of gold in   

No gold  

Well  I don t 

have it here. 

No gold. 

Fuck off. 

I don t want 

to practice today. 

No  

They killed Jory. 

My father is hurt. 

I don t care about 

stupid wooden swords. 

You are troubled. 

  Yes. 

   i Good   i  

Trouble is the perfect 

time for training. 

When you are dancing in the meadow 

with your dolls and kittens  

this is not 

when fighting happens. 

I don t like 

dolls and k   

 i You re not here.  i  

 i You re with  i  

 i your trouble.  i  

If you are with your trouble 

when fighting happens   

  More trouble for you. 

 i Just so.  i  

How can you be 

quick as a snake... 

...Or as quiet 

as a shadow... 

...When you are 

somewhere else  

You are fearing 

for your father  hmm  

That is right. 

  Do you pray to the gods  

  The old and the new. 

There is only one God 

and his name is Death. 

And there is only one thing 

we say to Death  

 Not today.

Tell me what she s saying. 

 The prince is riding. 

I have heard the thunder 

of his hooves. 

Swift as the wind he rides. 

His enemies 

will cower before him... 

And their wives will 

weep tears of blood.  

She s going 

to have a boy. 

He won t be 

a real Targaryen. 

He won t be 

a true Dragon.

The stallion is 

the Khal of Khals. 

He shall unite the people

Rhaego... 

They love her. 

Rhaego  Rhaego  

Rhaego  

Rhaego... 

She truly is 

a queen today. 

Don t let them see you 

carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. 

You know the law. 

It s not my law. 

They don t belong to you. 

Whatever is hers 

is also mine. 

Once  perhaps. 

If I sell one egg  

I ll have enough to buy a ship. 

Two eggs   a ship 

and an army. 

  And you have all three. 

  I need a large army. 

I m the last hope 

of a dynasty  Mormont. 

The greatest dynasty 

this world has ever seen 

on my shoulders since 

I was five years old   

and no one has ever given me 

what they gave to her in that tent. 

Never. 

Not a piece of it. 

How can I carry 

what I need to carry without it  

Hmm  

Who can rule without wealth 

or fear or love  

Oh  you stand there  

all nobility and honor. 

You don t think I see you looking 

at my little sister  hmm  

Don t think I know 

what you want  

I don t care. 

You can have her. 

She can be Queen 

of the savages and dine 

on the finest 

bloody horseparts  

and you can dine on whichever 

parts of her you like. 

But let me go. 

You can go. 

You can t have the eggs. 

You swore 

an oath to me. 

Does loyalty 

mean nothing to you  

It means everything to me. 

And yet here you stand. 

And yet here I stand. 

Mord  

Mord  

Mord  

Mord  

Mord. 

Noise again  

  About the gold... 

  No gold  

  No gold. 

  Listen to me  

Listen to me. 

Sometimes possession 

is an abstract concept   

When they captured me  

they took my purse  

but the gold 

is still mine. 

Where  

Where  

I don t know where  

but when they free me   

You want free  

Go be free. 

Have you ever 

heard the phrase 

 rich as a Lannister   

 i Of course you have   i  

You re a smart man. 

You know who 

the Lannisters are. 

I am a Lannister. 

Tyrion  son of Tywin  

And of course  

you have also heard the phrase  

 a Lannister always 

pays his debts.  

If you deliver 

a message from me... 

to Lady Arryn  

I will be in your debt. 

I will owe you gold. 

If you deliver 

the message 

and I live  which I very much 

intend to do. 

What message  

Tell her I wish 

to confess my crimes. 

You wish to confess 

your crimes  

Yes  My Lady. 

I do  My Lady. 

The sky cells 

always break them. 

Speak  Imp. 

Meet your gods 

as an honest man. 

Where do I begin  

my lords and ladies  

I m a vile man  

I confess it. 

My crimes and sins 

are beyond counting. 

 i I have lied  i  

 i and cheated...  i  

 i gambled and whored.  i  

 i I m not particularly  i  

 i good at violence   i  

but I m good at convincing 

others to do violence for me. 

You want specifics  

I suppose. 

When I was seven 

I saw a servant girl 

bathing in the river. 

I stole her robe. 

She was forced to return 

to the castle 

naked and in tears. 

If I close my eyes  

I can still see her tits bouncing. 

When I was  I stuffed 

my Uncle s boots with goatshit. 

 i When confronted  i  

 i with my crime   i  

I blamed a squire. 

Poor boy was flogged 

and I escaped justice. 

 i When I was   i  

I milked my eel 

into a pot of turtle stew. 

I flogged the one eyed snake. 

I skinned my sausage. 

I made the bald man cry 

 i into the turtle stew   i  

which I do believe 

my sister ate. 

 i At least I hope she did.  i  

Once I brought a jackass 

and a honeycomb 

  into a brothel   

  Silence  

What happened next  

What do you think 

you re doing  

Confessing my crimes. 

Lord Tyrion  

you are accused 

of hiring a man to slay 

my son Bran in his bed  

 i and of conspiring to murder  i  

 i my sister s husband  i  

Lord Jon Arryn  

the Hand of the King. 

Oh  I m very sorry. 

I don t know anything 

about all that. 

You ve had 

your little joke. 

I trust you enjoyed it. 

Mord  take him back 

to the dungeon. 

But this time find 

a smaller cell... 

With a steeper floor. 

Is this how justice 

is done in the Vale  

 i You accuse me  i  

 i of crimes   i  

I deny them  

so you throw me into a cell 

 i to freeze and starve   i  

Where is 

the King s Justice  

I am accused 

and demand a trial  

If you re tried 

and found guilty  

then by the King s own laws 

you will pay with your life. 

I understand the law. 

We have no executioner 

in the Eyrie. 

Life is more elegant here. 

Open the moon door. 

 i You want a trial   i  

 i My Lord Lannister.  i  

Very well. 

My son will listen 

to whatever you have to say  

and you will hear 

his judgment. 

Then you will leave... 

By one door 

or the other. 

No need to bother 

Lord Robin. 

I demand a trial by combat. 

You have that right. 

My Lady  I beg the honor. 

Let me be your champion. 

The honor should be mine. 

For the love I bore 

your Lord husband  

let me avenge his death. 

   i I ll fight for you  My Lady.  i  

  It ll be my honor. 

  The honor should be mine. 

  Make the bad man fly  

Ser Vardis... 

You re quiet. 

Don t you want 

to avenge my husband  

With all my heart  

My Lady. 

But the Imp 

is half my size. 

It would be shameful to slaughter 

such a man and call it justice. 

Agreed. 

You demanded 

a trial by combat. 

Now I demand a champion. 

I have that right  same as you. 

My Lady  

I will gladly fight 

the Imp s champion for you. 

I wouldn t be 

too glad  Ser. 

I name my brother 

Jaime Lannister. 

 i The Kingslayer  i  

is hundreds of miles 

from here. 

Send a raven for him. 

I m happy to wait. 

The trial will be today. 

Do I have a volunteer  

Anyone  

Anyone  

I think we can assume 

that no one is willing   

I ll stand 

for the dwarf. 

More wine  Your Grace  

  What was I saying  

  Renly  Simpler time. 

It was  It was. 

You re too young to remember. 

Wasn t it simpler  Selmy  

  It was  Your Grace. 

  The enemy was right  in the open  

vicious as you like  all but 

sending you a bloody invitation. 

Nothing like today. 

  It sounds exhilarating. 

  Exhilarating  yes. 

Not as exhilarating 

as those balls 

and masquerades 

you like to throw. 

You ever fuck 

a Riverlands girl  

Once. 

I think. 

You think  

I think you d remember. 

Back in our day  

you weren t a real man 

until you d fucked one girl 

from each of the Seven Kingdoms 

and the Riverlands. 

  We used to call it  making the eight.  

  Those were some  i lucky  i  girls. 

You ever make 

the eight  Barristan  

I don t believe so  

Your Grace. 

Those were the days. 

Which days  exactly  

The ones where half of Westeros 

fought the other half and millions died  

Or before that  when the Mad King 

slaughtered women and babies 

because the voices in his head 

told him they deserved it  

Or way before that  when dragons 

burned whole cities to the ground  

Easy  boy. 

You might be my brother  

but you re speaking to the King. 

I suppose it was all 

rather heroic... 

If you were drunk enough 

and had some poor Riverlands whore 

to shove your prick inside 

and make the eight. 

More wine  Your Grace  

 i They burned most everything  i  

 i in the Riverlands   i  

 i Our fields   i  

 i Our granaries   i  

our homes. 

 i They took our women   i  

 i then they took  em again.  i  

When they was done  

they butchered them 

as if they was animals. 

They covered our children 

in pitch 

and lit them on fire. 

Brigands  most likely. 

They weren t thieves. 

They didn t steal 

nothing. 

They even left something behind  

Your Grace. 

It s the King s Hand 

you re addressing  not the King. 

The King is hunting. 

Fish. 

The Sigil of House Tully. 

Isn t that your wife s house   

Tully  My Lord Hand  

These men  

were they flying a Sigil  

  A banner  

  None  your   

Hand. 

 i The one who was  i  

 i leading them...  i  

Taller by a foot 

than any man I ve ever met  

saw him cut 

the blacksmith in two  

saw him take the head 

off a horse 

with a single swing 

of his sword. 

That sounds like 

someone we know. 

The Mountain. 

You re describing 

Ser Gregor Clegane. 

Why should Ser Gregor 

turn brigand  

The man is 

an anointed knight. 

I ve heard him called 

Tywin Lannister s mad dog. 

I m sure you have 

as well. 

Can you think 

of any reason 

the Lannisters 

might possibly have 

for being angry 

with your wife  

Maester Pycelle  

 i If the Lannisters  i  

were to order attacks 

on villages 

under the King s 

protection  

  it would be   

  That would be almost as brazen 

as attacking the Hand of the King 

in the streets of the capital. 

Well... 

I cannot give you 

back your homes 

 i or restore  i  

 i your dead to life   i  

but perhaps I can 

give you justice 

 i in the name of our King   i  

 i Robert.  i  

Lord Beric Dondarrion. 

You shall have the command. 

Assemble  men 

  and ride to Ser Gregor s keep. 

  As you command. 

In the name of Robert 

of the House Baratheon  

the first of his name  

King of the Andals and the first men  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms 

and protector of the realm  

I charge you to bring 

the King s Justice 

to the false knight 

Gregor Clegane 

and all those 

who shared in his crimes. 

I denounce him 

and attaint him. 

I strip him of all 

ranks and titles  

 i of all lands and holdings   i  

  and sentence him to death. 

  My Lord... 

This   this is 

a drastic action. 

It would be better to wait 

for King Robert s return. 

  Grand Maester Pycelle. 

  My Lord. 

Send a raven 

to Casterly Rock. 

Inform Tywin Lannister that 

he has been summoned to court 

 i to answer for the crimes  i  

 i of his bannermen.  i  

He will arrive within the fortnight 

or be branded an enemy of the crown 

and a traitor 

to the realm. 

A bold move  My Lord  

and admirable. 

But is it wise 

to yank the lion s tail  

Tywin Lannister is the richest man 

in all the Seven Kingdoms. 

Gold wins wars  

not soldiers. 

Then how come 

Robert is King 

and not Tywin Lannister  

 i Hold   i  

 i   Attack attack   i  

 i   Come on  Ser Vardis   i  

 i Attack   i  

Stand and fight  coward  

Yes  

Enough  Ser Vardis  Finish him. 

 i What are you doing   i  

 i Get up   i  

 i Get up  get up   i  

 i get up   i  

 i Raise your sword.  i  

 i Raise it   i  

Get up  man  

   i On your feet   i  

   i Get up   i  

 i Get up and fight   i  

 i Ser Vardis   i  

 i No  Have mercy   i  

Is it over  

You don t fight 

with honor  

No. 

He did. 

Can I make 

the little man fly now  

Not this little man. 

This little man 

is going home. 

I believe you have 

something of mine. 

A Lannister always 

pays his debts. 

You wear your hair like 

a real southern lady now. 

Well  why shouldn t I  

We re in the South. 

It s important to remember where 

you come from. 

I m not sure your mother would 

like these new styles. 

My mother isn t 

 i from  i  the North. 

I m aware of that. 

Why do you care  

Do you even have hair 

under there  

Yes. 

I have hair. 

I ve never seen it. 

Would you like to  

No. 

Where are you from anyway  

The North or the South  

I come from a very 

small village in   

Oh  wait. 

I just realized 

I don t care. 

  Sansa   

  Septa. 

Now you are being rude. 

My prince. 

My prince. 

My Lady. 

I fear I have 

behaved monstrously 

the past few weeks. 

With your permission  

It s beautiful  

like the one 

your mother wears. 

You ll be queen someday. 

It s only fitting 

you should look the part. 

Will you forgive me 

for my rudeness  

There s nothing to forgive. 

You re My Lady. 

One day we ll be married 

in the throne room. 

Lords and ladies from all over 

the Seven Kingdoms will come  

from the last hearth 

in the North 

to the Salt Shore 

in the South  

and you will be Queen 

over all of them. 

 i I ll never  i  

 i disrespect you again.  i  

I ll never be cruel 

to you again. 

Do you understand me  

You re My Lady now  

from this day 

until my last day. 

Stop. 

  Stop  

  Whoa. 

  What are you doing  

  Going to King s Landing. 

In a turnip cart  

I ll find a ship heading 

south in White Harbor. 

And you can afford that  

Some of my friends are more 

generous than others. 

There s a thousand 

girls like you in King s Landing. 

So I ll have 

lots of company. 

Yes  you ll be 

very popular... 

Until some fat lord 

comes to visit 

with a big belly 

and a little prick 

and he can t get it up 

so he knocks all your teeth out. 

And what will happen 

to me if I stay here  

Will I become 

Lady Greyjoy  

  mistress of the Iron Islands  

  Don t be a fool. 

I hear Jaime Lannister 

attacked Lord Stark 

in the streets 

of King s Landing. 

Every man for a hundred miles will be 

marching off to war soon 

and most of them 

will never come back. 

There s nothing left 

for me here. 

Let s go  Stefon. 

 i Giddyup.  i  

Let me see it 

one more time  

See what  

I m going to miss you. 

I know. 

I m sending you both 

back to Winterfell. 

  What   

  Listen   

  What about Joffrey  

  Are you dying because of your leg  

 i Is that why  i  

 i you re sending us home   i  

What  No. 

Please  father. 

Please don t. 

You can t. 

I ve got my lessons with Syrio. 

I m finally 

getting good. 

This isn t 

a punishment. 

I want you back in Winterfell 

for your own safety. 

Can we take Syrio 

back with us  

Who cares about your 

stupid dancing teacher  

I can t go. 

I m supposed to marry 

Prince Joffrey. 

I love him and I m meant 

to be his Queen 

  and have his babies. 

  Seven hells. 

When you re old enough  

I ll make you a match 

with someone who s worthy of you  

someone who s brave 

and gentle and strong   

I don t want someone brave 

and gentle and strong. I want him  

He ll be the greatest 

King that ever was  a golden lion  

and I ll give him 

sons with beautiful blond hair. 

 i The lion sot  i  

 i s Sigil  idiot.  i  

He s a stag  

like his father. 

He is not. 

He s nothing like that old drunk King. 

Go on  girls. Get your Septa and start 

packing your things. 

  Wait  

  Come on. 

But it s not fair  

 Lord Orys Baratheon

Stop him.

Back there. 

That is no place 

for a King. 

You are no King. 

Keep away from me  

Viserys  please. 

There she is. 

Put the sword down. 

They ll kill us all. 

They can t kill us. 

They can t shed blood 

in their sacred city. 

But I can. 

I want what I came for. 

I want the crown 

he promised me. 

He bought you. 

But he never 

paid for you. 

Tell him I want what was bargained 

for or I m taking you back. 

He can keep the baby. 

I ll cut it out 

and leave it for him.

That was all I wanted. 

What what was promised.

Long may he reign.

He sits the throne

Yes. He wasn t 

though  was he 

No  he wasn t.

You still mourn for Joffrey 

He was my husband.

My king.

He would have been

your nightmare.

Your Grace  I feel   

You knew exactly what he was.

I did  too.

You never love

anything in the world

the way you love

your first child.

Doesn t matter what they do.

And what he did  it shocked me.

Do you think I m easily shocked 

No.

The things he did shocked me.

He s only a boy.

A good boy.

A decent boy.

He always has been.

 i Who was the last  i 

 i decent king  I wonder   i 

He could be the first man

who sits on that throne

in  years

to actually deserve it.

It would be some

consolation  wouldn t it 

For all the horror

that put him there.

He will need help...

if he s going to rule well.

He has you.

A mother is not enough.

You re still interested

in being queen  I take it 

Oh.

After all

that s happened   

it sounds strange 

I know  but I am   

I haven t even given

any thought to it 

what comes next.

It would be a great

honor  of course.

But I will have to speak

to my father about it.

Yes  speak to your father.

I ll speak to mine.

We may be faced with an alarming

number of weddings soon.

 chuckles 

I won t even know

what to call you.

Sister 

Or Mother 

Hmm.

King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

Murdered at his own wedding.

Barristan  i  And we have taken the

Meereenese navy  Your Grace.  i 

The Second Sons took

the Meereenese navy.

Who told you to take the navy 

No one.

So why did you do it 

I heard you liked ships.

How many ships 

  Your Grace.

How many men can they carry 

   not counting sailors.

Would that be enough

to take King s Landing 

The Lannisters have more.

Joffrey s wars for years.  i 

They re tired  dispersed.

 i And now their king is dead.  i 

  Unsullied

It s hard to say.

It could be enough.

But we re not fighting to make

you queen of King s Landing.

can t conquer Westeros.

The old houses

will flock to our queen

when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

The old houses will flock to

There s other news.

From Yunkai.

Without the Unsullied

to enforce your rule 

 i the Wise Masters have  i 

 i retaken control of the city.  i 

 i They ve reenslaved the

freedmen who stayed behind  i 

and sworn to take

revenge against you.

And in Astapor 

the council you installed

to rule over the city

has been overthrown

by a butcher named Cleon

 i who s declared himself  i 

 i   His Imperial Majesty.    i 

Please leave me.

Not you  Jorah.

It appears my liberation

of Slaver s Bay

isn t going quite as planned.

You could sail for Westeros

and leave it all behind.

A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

A boy many believe to be a

bastard with no right to it.

They ve never been

more vulnerable.

You counseled me against

rashness once in Qarth.

I didn t listen.

That all worked out well.

 chuckles 

How can I rule seven kingdoms

if I can t control Slaver s Bay 

Why should anyone trust me 

Why should anyone follow me 

 i You re a Targaryen.  i 

You re the Mother of Dragons.

I need to be more than that.

I will not let those I have

freed slide back into chains.

I will not sail for Westeros.

What  then 

I will do what queens do.

I will rule.

Pull up your hood.

A memorable shade.

But how would they know 

You know what kind of stories

poor men enjoy the most 

Ones about rich girls

Is this the only way

into the Eyrie 

The mountains are impassable.

If you want to get to the Eyrie 

you need to go through

the Bloody Gate.

It doesn t matter how

large your army is 

if you attack this gate 

you do it on this road 

three men abreast

and get slaughtered like goats.

The first Lords of the

Vale didn t have much 

but they had these mountains

and they knew how to use them.

And the fortress they built

here has never been overcome.

 i  door opens   i 

Uncle Petyr 

Littlefinger       i My lord.  i 

Oh.

I have brought you a gift.

Lord Baelish.

    My lady.

    Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

A beautiful gift

for a beautiful boy.

It s a pleasure to make

your acquaintance  Lady Arryn.

My name is Al   

Oh  do take down

that hood  child.

Don t you think know

who you are 

 i You think I d let my intended  i 

leave the Eyrie

on urgent business

without knowing

what that business was 

I let him go so he could

bring you here to me.

My flesh and blood.

It s wonderful

to meet you  Aunt Lysa.

You mustn t call me that

in front of anyone else.

Of course.

I understand.

No one can know you re here.

It would put us in a very

precarious position.

I would never say a thing.

The Lannisters

want to destroy us.

They ve been trying for years.

 i Now they know  i 

 i what it feels like.  i 

Mummy said they killed your mother and

they chopped off your brother s head.

They did  and my father s.

They killed my father 

too  with poison.

I wanted to make the little

Lannister baby man fly 

but Mother said I couldn t.

Make him fly 

Through the Moon Door.

 giggles 

Lysa       i And on top of

everything else   i 

they made you marry

that filthy troll.

They did.

They made us both.

Lord Tyrion didn t want to.

Lysa       i I don t believe

that for a moment.  i 

Did he force himself on you 

No.

    We never   

    Lysa  i  Good.  i 

Robin  this is

your cousin Sansa.

But you re not to call

her Sansa in front of anyone

but Uncle Petyr and myself.

Do you understand 

Sansa  this is my son Robin.

It s a pleasure

to meet you  Robin.

Robin  show Sansa

to her chamber.

Take the back stairs.

Go.

We ll speak soon.

What took you so long 

Arranging for the ascension

of King Tommen I 

extricating Sansa 

getting her here alive.

She s here. We ve spent more than

enough time on her for one evening.

Let s get married tonight.

Ought we not...

inform the Lords of the

Vale about the ceremony 

There s only one

Lord of the Vale.

The others can all hang.

Lurking and simpering

on the stairs like buzzards

the moment my husband died 

trying to get their claws in me.

I do think that

we could wait until   

I m done waiting  Petyr.

We had our wedding night

many years ago.

Or don t you remember 

Like it was yesterday.

What wife would do for you

the things I ve done for you 

What wife would trust you

the way I ve trusted you 

When you gave me those drops

and told me to pour

them into Jon s wine 

my husband s wine   

when you told me

to write a letter to Cat

telling her it was

the Lannisters   

 moans 

The deed is done.

Faded into nothing.

Only speaking of it

can make it real.

Tonight it is  then.

 laughs 

Let me bathe and dress

for the occasion.

Once I m presentable  I ll call

on the septon immediately.

I m warning you.

I m going to scream when my

husband makes love to me.

I m going to scream so loud 

they ll hear me clear

across the Narrow Sea.

 i  Lysa screaming   i 

 i  grunting  moaning   i 

 i  screaming   i 

 i  moaning  screaming continues   i 

When will the wedding

take place in your mind 

As soon as decency permits.

After we ve allowed Tommen the

appropriate time to mourn his brother

and Margaery

to mourn her husband.

    A fortnight 

    That seems reasonable.

No jugglers 

no jousting dwarves 

no  course meals.

And your wedding to Loras 

Shortly after Tommen s.

    Shortly 

    A fortnight.

I know you don t like them.

I didn t like your husband.

Used to pat me

on the back a lot.

I didn t trust him.

We had that in common.

You don t need to make formal

alliances with people you trust.

Then whom can we trust 

Ourselves alone.

The Tyrells

are our only true rivals

in terms of resources

and we need them on our side.

Robert wasn t particularly rich.

Robert had me funding him.

Wars swallow gold

like a pit in the earth.

I suppose that explains why we

did so well in the last one.

Do you know how much gold was mined

in the Westerlands this past year 

Haven t a clue.

Go on  your best guess.

Pounds  tons  ounces 

Doesn t matter.

The answer is the same.

That can t be.

Our last working mine

ran dry three years ago.

Then how do we pay for anything 

The crown owes

the Iron Bank of Braavos

a tremendous amount of money.

How much 

A tremendous amount.

There must be someone

at the Iron Bank

you can speak to 

come to some arrangement.

The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

There is no someone.

Someone does work there.

It is comprised of people.

And a temple

is comprised of stones.

One stone crumbles

and another takes its place.

And the temple holds its form

for   years or more.

That s what the Iron Bank is  a temple.

We all live in its shadow

and almost none of us know it.

You can t run from them.

You can t cheat them.

You can t sway them

with excuses.

If you owe them money and you

don t want to crumble yourself 

you pay it back.

Vesting the Tyrells in the crown

will help a great deal

in this respect.

It s for the good of the

family  I understand that.

I m not sure my brothers do.

I know you re building

a strong case against Tyrion.

 i And as a mother   i 

 i that is your right.  i 

But as a judge  I cannot

discuss the trial with you.

I respect that.

We don t need to discuss it.

The Lannister legacy is the

only thing that matters.

You ve started wars

to protect this family.

Turned your back on Jaime

for refusing to

contribute to its future.

What does Tyrion deserve

for lighting

that future on fire 

Arya       i Joffrey.  i 

Cersei.

Walder Frey.

Meryn Trant.

 i Tywin Lannister.  i 

The Red Woman.

Beric Dondarrion.

 i Thoros of Myr.  i 

 i Ilyn Payne.  i 

The Mountain.

Would you shut up 

I can t sleep

until I say the names.

The names of every

fucking person in Westeros 

Only the ones I m going to kill.

 chuckles 

Hate s as good a thing

as any to keep a person going.

Better than most.

We come across my brother 

maybe we can both cross

a name off our list.

If he were here right now 

what would you do 

I d tell him to shut the fuck up

so I can get some sleep.

Go on  get it over with 

your list of doomed men.

I m almost done.

Only one name left.

Go on.

The Hound.

Thank you.

Your mother always had a

sweet tooth  you know 

    Really 

    Oh  yes.

At suppertime  she would go

straight for honey cakes 

candied almonds  custard.

Anything sweet.

Eventually  your grandfather

had to assign a septa

to watch her at meals.

Cat was the firstborn

daughter after all.

It was important

that she remain desirable

so Father could arrange

a good match for her

and she was starting to get fat.

My mother fat 

She never let me have my pudding

until I d finished

all my proper food.

This is before she married your

father and moved to the North.

By the time you were born  your

father s austerity had become hers.

Marriage changes people.

I didn t mean for you to stop.

Go on  enjoy them.

How do you like them 

They re delicious.

Where did you get the lemons 

You can t grow them up here.

Oh  gods  no.

Petyr had three crates brought

all the way from King s Landing.

He knew you liked lemon cakes.

He s so kind.

He really cares for you.

Think where you d

be without him.

In their clutches

and tried for murder.

Yes.

I m very lucky.

He feels responsible for you.

Oh  I know he does.

I m so grateful.

Why 

Why does he feel

responsible for you 

Well  I m half Tully.

    He loved your family so much.

    Loved your mother.

    No.

    That s what you wanted to say.

He loves you  Aunt Lysa.

He s married to you.

Your mother never

loved him. Never.

Cat always went straight

for the sweetest thing.

The most obvious thing.

Your Uncle Brandon.

Your handsome  arrogant 

cruel Uncle Brandon.

He almost killed Petyr

in a duel.

And your mother

loved him anyway.

And now Petyr is risking

his life to save you 

the daughter of a woman

who didn t love him

no more than those

whores in his brothels.

    Has he told you about them 

    No.

He hasn t told you about the vile

things they do with their bodies 

The vile things they let

him do with their bodies 

     i  No  never.  i 

    Are you pregnant 

What  No  I told you.

Lord Tyrion and I never   

I wasn t asking about Tyrion.

What have you let Petyr

do with your body 

    Aunt Lysa  no  I   

    Your young  pretty body.

    Nothing. I m a virgin.

    Don t lie to me.

You re hurting me.

I ll know if you lie.

I m a virgin  I swear it.

He loves you  Aunt Lysa.

All he says is that I m stupid.

I m a stupid little girl

with stupid dreams

who never learns

and I m a terrible liar 

so I should always

tell the truth.

And I swear to you that

he has never touched me.

    Not once  not ever.

    Shh. Shh. Shh.

It s all right.

It will all be all right.

You ll be a widow soon.

They ll execute that dwarf

for murdering the king

and you ll be free

to marry Robin.

You ll be the Lady of the Vale.

Hmm.

 horse whinnies 

 grunting 

Didn t they teach you

how to ride a horse 

Yes  my lady  when I was young.

There wasn t much call for

it with Lord Tyrion  though.

He preferred litters.

Perhaps you should

have stayed with him.

It s not going to be

a pleasant journey for you.

It could take weeks to get to the

Wall  depending on the weather.

That s a long way off.

Well  Lady Sansa s

brother s at Castle Black.

If I were her 

that s where I d go.

Feel free to stop at any point.

Never  my lady.

I m your squire.

I ve made it this far in

the world without a squire.

I don t see why I need one now.

All knights have

squires  my lady.

 i I m not a knight.  i 

And I m not a slaver  either.

I don t own you.

I swore an oath  my lady.

I am releasing you

from that oath.

That means you could leave.

I know.

What do you think

will happen if you leave 

They ll say I wasn t

a very good squire.

 horse nickers 

 whinnies 

    The hell you doing 

    Practicing.

    What  ways to die 

    No one s going to kill me.

They will if you nance

around like that.

That s no way to fight.

It s not fighting.

It s water dancing.

Dancing 

Maybe you ought

to put on a dress.

Who taught you that shite 

The greatest swordsman

who ever lived.

Syrio Forel  the First Sword

to the Sealord of Braavos.

Braavos.

 scoffs 

Greasy haired little

bastard  I bet.

They all are.

What do you know about anything 

I bet his hair is greasier

than Joffrey s cunt.

    It was not.

    Was  He dead 

    Yes.

    How 

    He was killed.

    Who by 

Meryn Trant.

That s why Ser Meryn   

Meryn Trant 

The greatest swordsman who ever lived

killed by Meryn fucking Trant 

    He was outnumbered.

    Any boy whore with a sword

could beat three Meryn Trants.

Syrio didn t have a sword.

Or armor. Just a stick.

The greatest swordsman who ever

lived didn t have a sword 

 laughs 

All right.

You have a sword.

Let s see what he taught you.

Go on  do it for

your Braavosi friend.

Dead like all the rest

of your friends.

 grunts 

Your friend s dead

and Meryn Trant s not

 cause Trant had armor

and a big fucking sword.

Writing letters 

A poem  actually.

May I show you the gardens 

I couldn t very well

refuse a royal escort.

No  you couldn t.

I didn t realize

you were a poet.

Not a very good one.

For your paramour 

For one of my daughters.

You have several  don t you 

Eight.

Eight 

Eight daughters 

The fifth is difficult.

I named her after

my sister Elia.

Beautiful name.

Yes.

But I can t say it

without turning sad.

And after I turn sad 

I grow angry.

Perhaps that s why

she s difficult.

The gods love their

stupid jokes  don t they 

Which joke is that 

You re a prince of Dorne.

A legendary fighter.

A brilliant man feared

throughout Westeros.

But you could not

save your sister.

I m a Lannister.

Queen for  years.

Daughter of the most

powerful man alive.

But I could not save my son.

What good is power

if you cannot protect

the ones you love 

We can avenge them.

Yes  we can avenge them.

You really believe

Tyrion murdered your son 

I know he did.

We will have a trial and

we will learn the truth.

We ll have a trial  anyway.

I haven t seen my

daughter in over a year.

The last time I saw her 

she was swimming with two of

my girls in the Water Gardens.

Laughing in the sun.

I want to believe that.

I want to believe she s happy.

You have my word.

We don t hurt

little girls in Dorne.

Everywhere in the world 

they hurt little girls.

Would you bring her

a gift for me 

 i I wasn t there for her name day.  i 

I don t know when

I ll see her again.

Anything at all.

The best shipwrights

in King s Landing

have been working

on it for months.

Myrcella loves the open water.

Oberyn       i I will have it sailed

down to Sunspear for her.  i 

Please tell her...

her mother misses her very much.

Podrick      Oh  no  no  no.

No  no  no  no.

Hells.

Gods.

Did you remove the skin 

No  my lady.

Have you ever cooked

a rabbit before 

No  my lady.

Did you ever cook

anything for Lord Tyrion 

No  my lady.

That was the cooks.

 groans 

What are you doing 

I m helping you with your armor.

I ve been removing my own armor for

quite some time  thank you very much.

What exactly did you do

for Lord Tyrion 

I brought him his meals and cleared

his table when he was finished.

I kept his clothing

and linens clean.

Carried his messages

and returned the replies.

Mostly I poured wine.

Oh.

Whilst in Lord Tyrion s service 

did you ever do anything

remotely related to combat 

I killed a man.

Who 

A Kingsguard.

He tried to kill

Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

How did you kill a Kingsguard 

I pushed a spear through

the back of his head.

Bloody ridiculous.

Help me with these straps.

King Stannis is my God. 

He raised me up 

and gave you a future 

I could never have imagined. 

And you think a Fire God 

commanded all that  

  It was Stannis. 

  Stannis is my king  but he s only a man. 

Don t tell him that. 

Does it give you joy 

to scare people  

No  it gives me joy 

to kill people. 

Killing s the sweetest 

thing there is. 

You shipped off my only daughter 

and now you want 

to send my eldest son 

to the battlefield to die. 

He needs to be out there. 

The men will fight more

fighting beside them instead of 

hiding behind his mother s skirts. 

Stannis two days from the capital

Now is the time to strike. 

My dear nephew  

you do understand Stannis 

Baratheon sails this way  

They say Stannis never smiles. 

I ll give him a red smile. 

If the wind holds  we ll reach 

King s Landing in a day. 

Will it hold  

Can t make promises 

for the wind  Your Grace. 

Stannis knows King s Landing. 

He knows where 

the walls are strongest 

and he knows which gates 

are weakest. 

Mud gate. 

That s where he ll land.

I spent most of my life 

dodging the Royal Fleet. 

And now I m sailing 

right at them. 

This is the Royal Fleet. 

And you re not a smuggler anymore  

you re the high captain. 

Of course there are several 

Royal Fleets at the moment. 

Not after tonight. 

When the sun rises  

Stannis will sit 

on the Iron Throne 

and you will be his Hand. 

  Gods be good. 

  God. 

Father  there is only one

  But not over them  

  Over all of us. 

The people of King s Landing

Joffrey Baratheon. 

They will be glad to see 

his head on a spike. 

Well  first we have 

to put it there. 

Our ships outnumber 

theirs  to one. 

Our army outnumber 

theirs five to one. 

Those walls have 

never been breached. 

And the men 

guarding the walls  

when they see you  

they don t see a liberator. 

They see a stranger come 

to set their city on fire. 

I have faith 

in the Lord of Light. 

I have faith 

in our cause. 

And I have faith 

in my captain. 

 i   Thunder crashes    i

Of course I m afraid. 

I won t let

I m a Lannister. 

I don t have 

a choice in all this. 

But it s not your war. 

It is now. 

You can t fuck your way 

out of everything. 

I have so far. 

Do you remember what you said 

when you met me in your tent  

That I should make love

last day on this earth.

of the house he serves  

but also to offer guidance 

and counsel 

in times of war. 

Your words are always 

wise and measured. 

  If you could   

  If anything  

a Maester s duties 

become more urgent 

in times of war 

and turmoil. 

I remember back 

in the days of king   

You brought me something  

Yes. 

Essence of Nightshade 

is as dangerous 

as it is efficacious. 

A single drop 

in a cup of wine 

suffices to soothe 

ragged nerves. 

 i Three drops  i  

 i will bring on a deep  i  

 i and dreamless sleep.  i  

 i  drops  however    i  

I know what  drops 

will bring. 

  Your Grace  if I may ask   

  You may not. 

You must have 

a lot of work to do. 

I m sure many brave men 

will need your wisdom soon. 

Yes. 

A siege is very   

Be careful on the stairs  Grand Maester. 

There are so many. 

  Sighs   

Your Grace. 

 i   Men singing    i  

    and so he spoke     

 i     that Lord of Castamere      i  

 i     but now the rains      i  

    weep o er his halls     

    with no one there 

to hear     

    yes  now the rains     

    weep o er his halls     

    and not a soul to hear.     

  To the boys  

  Lannisters  

Where d you learn 

the Lannister song  

  Drunk Lannisters. 

    Men laugh   

You ve got 

a pretty voice. 

Thank you very much. 

And I like 

your nose. 

How many times 

you break it  

Well  now let s see. 

 i First time I was five.  i  

Me mom smacked me 

with an iron poker. 

Ooh. 

Oh  it wasn t me 

she was aiming at. 

She was trying 

for me little brother. 

Now he was a real pest. 

Second time I was nine. 

Got in a scrap 

with a few older boys. 

They won. 

Third time... 

Eh  you don t want to know 

about the third time. 

Poor nose. 

Don t feel sorry 

for him. 

He ll be halfway up your ass 

before the night s through. 

  Men laugh   

  Chatter stops   

Welcome  friends. 

This round s on me. 

I don t think 

he likes me. 

You think 

you re a hard man  

  Chuckles  slaps   

  I know it. 

    Men laugh   

It s warm in here. 

We ve got beautiful women 

and good brown ale. 

Plenty for everyone. 

And all you want 

is to put one of us 

in the cold ground 

with no women 

to keep us company. 

Oh  there s women 

in the ground. 

I put some there myself. 

So have you. 

You like fucking 

and drinking 

and singing. 

But killing   

killing s the thing 

you love. 

You re just like me. 

Only smaller. 

And quicker. 

Eh  

  Chuckles   

Your Lord Imp 

is gonna miss you. 

Aye. 

  Slaps   

I expect he will someday. 

   i   Bell tolling    i  

  Man   i Here we are.  i  

  Chatter   

One more drink 

before the war  

Shall we  

I ve always 

hated the bells. 

They ring for horror   

a dead king  

a city under siege. 

  A wedding. 

  Exactly. 

Podrick  is that it  

 Is that it   

Nice touch. 

As if you don t know the name 

of every boy in town. 

I m not entirely sure 

what you re suggesting. 

I m entirely sure you re entirely 

sure what I m suggesting. 

Do you trust him  

Oddly enough  I do. 

Good. 

The map you asked for. 

There must be  miles 

of tunnels beneath the city. 

Closer to . 

 i The Targaryens built this  i  

 i city to withstand a siege  i  

and to provide escape 

if necessary. 

I m not escaping. 

Strange as it sounds  

I m the captain of the ship. 

And if the ship goes down  

I go with her. 

That is good to hear. 

Though I m sure many 

captains say the same 

while their ship 

is afloat. 

You look well suited 

for battle  My Lord. 

Well  I m not. 

For all our sakes  

I hope you are wrong. 

My little birds tell me 

that Stannis Baratheon 

has taken up with a Red 

Priestess from Asshai. 

What of it  

You don t believe in 

the old powers  My Lord  

Blood spells  curses  shape shifting   

what do you think  

I think you believe 

in what you see 

and in what those 

you trust have seen. 

You probably don t 

entirely trust me. 

Mm  don t take it 

personally. 

I don t entirely 

trust myself. 

And yet I have seen things 

 i and heard things    i  

things you have not  

things I wish I had not. 

I don t believe I ve ever 

told you how I was cut. 

No  I don t believe 

you have. 

One day I will. 

The dark arts have provided 

Lord Stannis with his armies 

and paved his path 

to our door. 

For a man in service to such 

powers to sit on the Iron Throne  

I can think 

of nothing worse. 

And tonight  

I believe you are the only man 

who can stop him. 

  Tolling continues   

They re welcoming 

the new king. 

I ve never known bells 

to mean surrender. 

They want to play

I know what  in  means. 

  Do you know how to use that  

  I chopped wood once. 

No  I watched my brother 

chopping wood. 

I saw you kill a man 

with a shield. 

You ll be unstoppable 

with an axe. 

  Don t get killed. 

  Nor you  my friend. 

  Oh  are we friends now  

  Of course we are. 

Just because I pay you 

for your services doesn t 

diminish our friendship. 

Enhances it  really. 

Oh  enhances. 

Fancy word for a sellsword. 

Been spending time 

with fancy folks. 

Lady Sansa 

and  uh  Sheila. 

Shae. 

Shae  yes. 

Surely my sister 

has asked you to join 

the other highborn ladies 

in Maegor s holdfast. 

She has  My Lord  

but King Joffrey sent 

for me to see him off. 

Sansa. 

He s been a great 

romantic  my nephew. 

Joffrey  

 i Sansa  come here.  i  

I will pray for your 

safe return  My Lord. 

Will you  

Just as I pray 

for the King s. 

Stay safe  My Lady. 

And you  my lion. 

Your king rides forth 

to battle. 

You should see him 

off with a kiss. 

My new blade. 

Hearteater I ve named it. 

Kiss it. 

You ll kiss it again 

when I return 

and taste 

my Uncle s blood. 

Will you slay him 

yourself  

If Stannis is fool enough 

to come near me. 

So you ll be outside the gates 

fighting in the Vanguard  

A king doesn t discuss 

battle plans 

with stupid girls. 

I m sorry  Your Grace. 

You re right  I m stupid. 

Of course you ll be 

in the Vanguard. 

They say my brother 

Robb always goes 

where the fighting 

is thickest. 

And he is only 

a pretender. 

Your brother s turn 

will come. 

Then you can lick his blood 

off Hearteater  too. 

Some of those boys 

will never come back. 

Joffrey will. 

The worst ones 

always live. 

Shh. 

Come  My Lady. 

  Men shouting   

  Neighing

  Where s our fleet  

  On the way. 

Why isn t it here now  

They re coming. 

Hound  tell the Hand that his 

King has asked him a question. 

The King has asked 

you a question. 

Ser Lancel  tell the Hound 

to tell the king 

that the Hand 

is extremely busy. 

The Hand of the King 

would like me to tell 

you to tell the King   

If I tell the Hound 

to cut you in half  

he ll do it without 

a second thought. 

That would make me 

the Quarterman. 

It just doesn t have 

the same ring to it. 

Cut me in half and I won t 

be able to give the signal. 

 i No signal  no plan.  i  

No plan and Stannis 

Baratheon sacks this city  

takes the Iron Throne  

puts your pinched 

little head atop 

a gate somewhere. 

It might be quite amusing  

except that my head 

would be up there  too. 

I ve never much 

liked my head  

but I don t want to see 

it removed just yet. 

 i   Drums beating    i  

Where are their ships  

It is wise to attack at night. 

We took them by surprise. 

Lord Varys knows what you had 

for breakfast three days ago. 

There are 

no surprises here. 

If it s true there is dissension 

in their ranks  

maybe their sailors 

have mutinied. 

Maybe. 

 i   Babies crying    i  

I don t know why 

she wants me here. 

She s always saying 

how stupid I am. She hates me. 

Maybe she hates you less than 

she hates everyone else. 

I doubt it. 

Maybe she s 

jealous of you. 

Why would she 

be jealous  

Sansa. 

I was wondering where 

our little dove had flown. 

You look pale  child. 

Is your red flower 

still blooming  

Yes. 

Fitting  isn t it  

The men will bleed out there 

and you will bleed in here. 

Pour Lady Sansa 

some wine. 

I m not thirsty  

Your Grace. 

So  I didn t 

offer you water. 

What s he doing here  

Ser Ilyn  

 i He s here to defend us.  i  

When the axes smash 

down those doors  

you may be glad 

to have him. 

But we have guards 

to defend us. 

Guards we have paid. 

Should the city fall  

they ll be the first ones 

out of the doors. 

The lads caught a groom and 

two maids trying to sneak away 

 i with a stolen horse  i  

 i and some gold cups.  i  

The battle s first 

traitors. 

Have Ser Ilyn 

see to them. 

Put their heads on spikes outside 

the stables as a warning. 

The only way to keep 

the small folk loyal 

is to make certain they fear you 

more than they do the enemy. 

Remember that if you ever 

hope to become a queen.

He is. 

Traitors are a danger

  Cheering   

Sansa  come here

My queen. 

What are you doing  

Praying. 

You re perfect  

aren t you  

Praying. 

 i What are you praying for   i  

For the Gods to have 

mercy on us all. 

Oh. 

On all of us  

  Yes  Your Grace. 

  Even me  

Of course  

Your Grace. 

Even Joffrey  

  Joffrey is my   

  Oh  shut up  you little fool. 

Praying to the Gods 

to have mercy on us all. 

The Gods have no mercy. 

That s why they re Gods. 

 i My father told me that  i  

 i when he caught me praying.  i  

My mother just died  

you see. 

I didn t really understand 

the concept of death  

the finality of it. 

I thought that if I prayed 

very  very hard  

the Gods would return 

my mother to me. I was four. 

Your father doesn t 

believe in the Gods  

He believes in them  he just 

doesn t like them very much. 

One for her. 

Here. 

Sit. 

Drink. 

Not like that. 

Drink  girl. 

I should have been 

born a man. 

I d rather face   swords 

than be shut up inside 

with this flock 

of frightened hens. 

They are your guests 

under your protection. 

You asked them here. 

It was expected of me  

as it will be of you if you ever 

become Joffrey s queen. 

If my wretched brother 

should somehow prevail  

these hens will return 

to their cocks 

and crow of how my courage 

inspired them  

lifted their spirits. 

And if the city 

should fall  

You d like that  

wouldn t you  

The Red Keep 

should hold for a time  

long enough for me 

to go to the walls 

and yield to Lord Stannis 

in person. 

If it were anyone else 

outside those gates  

I might have hoped 

for a private audience. 

But this is Stannis Baratheon. 

I d have a better chance 

of seducing his horse. 

Have I shocked you  

little dove  

Tears aren t a woman s 

only weapon. 

The best one s 

between your legs. 

Learn how to use it. 

Drink. 

Do you have any notion 

of what happens 

when a city is sacked  

No  you wouldn t  

would you  

If the city falls  

these fine women 

should be in 

for a bit of a rape. 

 i Half of them  i  

 i will have bastards  i  

in their bellies 

come the morning. 

You ll be glad of 

your red flower then. 

When a man s blood 

is up  

anything with tits 

looks good. 

A precious thing like you 

will look very  very good.

Jaime was taught to fight 

with sword and lance and mace  

and I was taught to smile 

 i and sing and please.  i  

He was heir 

to Casterly Rock 

and I was sold to some 

stranger like a horse 

to be ridden 

whenever he desired. 

You were Robert s queen. 

And you will be 

Joffrey s. Enjoy. 

I don t think 

I know this one. 

Pretty. 

That s the worst 

curtsy I ve ever seen. 

Here  it s not difficult. 

I mastered it when I was four. 

Straighten your back 

and bend. 

Better. 

You learn fast. 

How long have you been 

in Lady Sansa s service  

A few weeks  

Your Grace. 

When did you 

leave Lorath  

I had a Lorathi 

handmaiden once. 

But she was 

a nobleman s daughter. 

You re not. 

When did you come 

to Westeros  

 years ago  

Your Grace. 

From Lorathi commoner 

to the Red Keep 

in  years  all without 

learning how to curtsy. 

I imagine that s 

a very interesting story. 

What s your name  

Shae  Your Grace. 

Tell us a story  Shae. 

  When I was   I

Hundreds of ships 

are burning  maybe more. 

Stannis s fleet 

destroyed  but... 

  Quietly   

But   but his troops 

have landed outside 

the city walls. 

Where is Joffrey  

On the battlements 

with Lord Tyrion. 

Bring him back 

inside at once. 

  But  Your Grace   

  What  

The King s presence 

is good for morale. 

Bring him back 

to his chambers now. 

  Not here  

  With the women and children  

Do you want him to be mocked as 

a coward for the rest of his life  

  No  but I   

  Now  

When I told you about 

Ser Ilyn earlier  I lied. 

Do you want to hear 

the truth  

You want to know why 

he s really here  

He s here for us. 

Stannis may take the city  

he may take the throne  

but he will not 

take us alive.

Look at me. 

Stannis is a killer. 

The Lannisters 

are killers. 

Your father was a killer. 

Your brother is a killer. 

Your sons will be 

killers someday. 

The world is built 

by killers. 

So you d better get 

used to looking at them. 

You won t hurt me.

You know the one about the 

mother lion and her little cub  

  They lived in the woods. 

  The Kingswood. 

Yes  my love. 

In the Kingswood there lived 

a mother and her cub. 

She loved him very much. 

But there were other things 

that lived in the woods. 

  Evil things. 

  Like what  

Like stags. 

Stags aren t evil. 

They only eat grass. 

And wolves. 

My Lord. 

Cersei   i He could hear them  i  

 i howling in the night.  i  

 i The little cub  i  

 i was frightened.  i  

 i His mother said   i  

 i  You are a lion  my son.  i  

 i You mustn t be afraid.  i  

For one day all the beasts 

will bow to you. 

You will be king. 

 i All the stags will bow.  i Ts 

 i all the wolves will bow.  i  

The bears in the north 

and the foxes of the south  

 i all the birds in the sky  i  

 i and the beasts in the sea    i  

they will all come 

to you  little lion... 

to rest a crown 

upon your head.  

And the cub said  

 Will I be strong 

and fierce like my father   

 Yes   said his mother. 

 You will be strong and fierce 

just like your father.  

I will keep you safe  

my love. 

I promise you.

  Maybe. 

You re Tyrion Lannister. 

You   you re Ned Stark s 

bastard  aren t you  

Let me give you 

some advice  bastard. 

Never forget what you are and it 

can never be used to hurt you. 

It s a direwolf. 

There are no direwolves 

south of the wall. 

Now there are five  one for 

each of the Stark children. 

  What about you  

  I m not a Stark. 

That one s yours  Snow. 

May I present Viserys

the rightful King 

of the Andals  

 i and his sister Daenerys   i  

I don t want to be his queen. 

I want to go home.

From your sister. 

She says Jon Arryn was 

murdered by the Lannisters. 

She says the King

died with him.

You need to drink  child. 

And eat. 

Isn t there 

anything else  

The Dothraki have two things 

in abundance  

Grass and horses. 

People can t live on grass.

it will cover everything   

that s the way the world will end. 

It ll get easier. 

Khaleesi  

Your hands. 

We re still not far 

from Pentos  your Grace. 

Magister Illyrio has 

extended his hospitality. 

You d be more 

comfortable there. 

I have no interest 

in hospitality or comfort. 

I ll stay with Drogo 

until he fulfills 

his end of the bargain 

and I have my crown. 

As you wish  your Grace. 

Well  Mormont  

as brutish as this life is  

I suppose it is preferable 

to beheading. 

What did Ned Stark 

want you for  

Buying from a slaver  

Selling to one   

some poachers I caught 

on my land. 

Under my reign  you won t be 

punished for such nonsense. 

You can rest assured 

of that. 

Better looking bitches 

than you re used to  Uncle. 

My mother s been 

looking for you. 

We ride for 

King s Landing today. 

Before you go  you will call 

on Lord and Lady Stark 

and offer 

your sympathies. 

What good will 

my sympathies do them  

None. But it is 

expected of you. 

Your absence has 

already been noted. 

The boy means 

nothing to me. 

And I can t stand 

the wailing of women. 

One word and I ll 

hit you again. 

I m telling mother  

Go  

Tell her. 

But first you will get 

to Lord and Lady Stark 

and you will fall on your knees 

in front of them 

and tell them how very sorry you are  

that you are at their service  

and that all your prayers are with them. 

Do you understand  

You can t   

Do you understand  

The prince will 

remember that  little lord. 

I hope so. 

If he forgets  be a good dog 

and remind him. 

Ah. 

Time for breakfast. 

Bread. 

And two of those little fish. 

And a mug of dark beer 

to wash it down. 

And bacon  

burned black. 

Hyah. 

  Little brother. 

  Beloved siblings. 

Is Bran going to die  

Apparently not. 

  What do you mean  

  The Maester says the boy may live. 

It s no mercy  letting a child 

linger in such pain. 

Only the gods 

know for certain. 

All the rest of us 

can do is pray. 

The charms of the north 

seem entirely lost on you. 

I still can t believe 

you re going. 

It s ridiculous 

even for you. 

Where s your sense 

of wonder  

The greatest structure ever built  

the intrepid men of The Night s Watch  

the wintry abode 

of the White Walkers. 

Tell me you re not thinking 

of taking the black. 

And go celibate  

The whores would go begging 

from Dorne to Casterly Rock. 

No  I just want to stand 

on top of the wall 

and piss off 

the edge of the world. 

The children don t need 

to hear your filth. 

Come. 

Even if the boy lives  

he ll be a cripple  a grotesque. 

Give me a good 

clean death any day. 

Speaking for the grotesques  

I d have to disagree. 

Death is so final  

whereas life... 

Ah  life is full 

of possibilities. 

I hope the boy does wake. 

I d be very interested 

to hear what he has to say. 

My dear brother  

there are times you make me 

wonder whose side you re on. 

 i My  i  dear brother  

you wound me. 

You know how much 

I love my family. 

Please. 

Oh  I would have 

dressed  your Grace. 

This is your home. 

I m your guest. 

Handsome one  isn t he  

I lost my first boy  

a little black haired beauty. 

He was a fighter too   

tried to beat the fever 

that took him. 

Forgive me. 

It s the last thing you 

need to hear right now. 

I never knew. 

It was years ago. 

Robert was crazed  beat 

his hands bloody on the wall  

all the things men do to show 

you how much they care. 

The boy looked 

just like him. 

Such a little thing... 

A bird without feathers. 

They came to take his body away 

and Robert held me. 

I screamed and I battled  

but he held me. 

That little bundle. 

They took him away 

and I never saw him again. 

Never have visited 

the crypt  never. 

I pray to the mother 

every morning and night 

that she return 

your child to you. 

I am grateful. 

Perhaps this time 

she ll listen. 

A sword for the wall  

  I already have one. 

  Good man. 

  Have you swung it yet  

  Of course I have. 

At someone  I mean. 

It s a strange thing  

the first time you cut a man. 

You realize we re nothing 

but sacks of meat 

and blood and some bone 

to keep it all standing. 

Let me thank you 

ahead of time 

for guarding us all from 

the perils beyond the wall   

Wildlings and White Walkers 

and whatnot. 

We re grateful to have 

good  strong men like you 

protecting us. 

We ve guarded the kingdoms 

for   years. 

Is it  we  already  

Have you taken 

your vows then  

Soon enough. 

Give my regards 

to The Night s Watch. 

I m sure it will be thrilling 

to serve in such an elite force. 

And if not  

It s only for life. 

Thank you  Nymeria. 

Septa Mordane says 

I have to do it again. 

My things weren t 

properly folded  she says. 

Who cares how they re folded   

They re going to get all 

messed up anyway. 

It s good 

you ve got help. 

Watch. 

Nymeria  gloves. 

  Impressive. 

  Shut up. 

Nymeria  gloves  

I have something for you. 

And it has to be packed 

very carefully. 

A present  

Close the door. 

This is no toy. 

Be careful you don t 

cut yourself. 

  It s so skinny. 

  So are you. 

I had the blacksmith 

make it for you special. 

 i It won t hack  i  

 i a man s head off   i  

but it can poke him full 

of holes if you re quick enough. 

I can be quick. 

You ll have to work 

at it every day. 

How does it feel  

Do you like 

the balance  

I think so. 

First lesson  Stick them 

with the pointy end. 

I know which end to use. 

I m going to miss you. 

Careful. 

All the best swords 

have names  you know. 

Sansa can keep 

her sewing needles. 

I ve got a needle 

of my own. 

I came to say 

goodbye to Bran. 

You ve said it. 

I wish I could be here 

when you wake up. 

I m going north 

with Uncle Benjen. 

I m taking the black. 

I know we always talked about 

seeing the wall together  

but you ll be able to come visit me 

at Castle Black when you re better. 

I ll know my way 

around by then. 

I ll be a sworn brother 

of The Night s Watch. 

We can go out walking beyond the wall  

if you re not afraid. 

I want you 

to leave. 

 years ago 

you rode off 

with Robert Baratheon. 

You came back a year later with 

another woman s son. 

And now 

you re leaving again. 

I have no choice. 

That s what men always say 

when honor calls. 

That s what you tell your families  

tell yourselves. 

You do have a choice. 

And you ve made it. 

Cat   

I can t do it  Ned. 

  I really can t. 

  You can. 

You must. 

You ve said 

goodbye to Bran  

He s not going to die. 

I know it. 

You Starks 

are hard to kill. 

My mother  

  She was very kind. 

  Good. 

Next time I see you  

you ll be all in black. 

It was always my color. 

  Farewell  Snow. 

  And you  Stark. 

There s great honor serving 

in The Night s Watch. 

 i The Starks have manned the wall  i  

 i for thousands of years.  i  

And you are a Stark. 

You might not have my name  

but you have my blood. 

Is my mother alive  

Does she know about me  

Where I am  where I m going  

Does she care  

The next time 

we see each other  

we ll talk 

about your mother. 

Huh  

I promise. 

Gods  this is country  

I ve half a mind to leave them 

all behind and keep going. 

I ve half a mind 

to go with you. 

What do you say  

just you and me 

on the Kingsroad  

swords at our sides  

a couple of tavern wenches 

to warm our beds tonight. 

You should have 

asked me  years ago. 

There were wars to fight  

women to marry   

we never had the chance 

to be young. 

I recall 

a few chances. 

There was that one... 

Oh  what was her name  

That common girl of yours  

Becca  With the great big tits 

you could bury your face in. 

Bessie. 

She was one of yours. 

Bessie  

Thank the gods for Bessie 

and her tits. 

Yours was... Aleena  

No. You told me once. 

Meryl  

Your bastard s mother  

  Wylla. 

   i That s it.  i  

 i She must have been  i  

 i a rare wench  i  

to make Lord Eddard Stark 

forget his honor. 

You never told me 

what she looked like. 

Nor will I. 

We were at war. 

 i None of us knew if we were  i  

 i gonna go back home again.  i  

You re too hard on yourself. 

You always have been. 

I swear if I weren t your King  

you d have hit me already. 

The worst thing 

about your coronation   

I ll never get 

to hit you again. 

Trust me  that s not 

the worst thing. 

There was a rider 

in the night. 

Daenerys Targaryen has wed 

some Dothraki horselord. 

What of it  

Should we send her a wedding gift  

A knife perhaps  

a good sharp one  

and a bold man to wield it. 

She s little more 

than a child. 

Soon enough that child will spread 

her legs and start breeding. 

  Tell me we re not speaking of this. 

  Oh  it s unspeakable to you  

 i What her father did to your family    i  

 i that was unspeakable.  i  

What Rhaegar Targaryen 

did to your sister   

 i the woman I loved.  i  

I ll kill every Targaryen 

I get my hands on. 

But you can t get 

your hands on this one  can you  

This Khal Drogo  

it s said he has   men 

in his horde. 

Even a million Dothraki 

are no threat to the realm  

as long as they remain on the 

other side of the Narrow Sea. 

They have no ships  

Robert. 

There are still those in the 

Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper. 

If the Targaryen boy crosses 

with a Dothraki horde at his back  

  the scum will join him. 

  He will not cross. 

And if by chance he does  

we ll throw him back into the sea. 

There s a war coming  Ned. 

 i I don t know when   i  

I don t know who 

we ll be fighting  

but it s coming. 

Sit. 

You ll be fed. 

 i Untie them.  i  

Ah  rapers. 

They were given a choice no doubt   

castration or the wall. 

Most choose the knife. 

Not impressed 

by your new brothers  

 i Lovely thing  i  

 i about the watch    i  

you discard your old family 

and get a whole new one. 

Why do you read so much  

Look at me and tell me 

what you see. 

Is this a trick  

What you see is a dwarf. 

If I d been born a peasant they might ve 

left me out in the woods to die. 

Alas  I was born a Lannister 

of Casterly Rock. 

Things are expected of me. 

My father was the Hand 

of the King for  years. 

Until your brother 

killed that King. 

Yes  until my brother 

killed him. 

 i Life is full of these  i  

 i little ironies.  i  

My sister married 

the new King 

and my repulsive nephew 

will be King after him. 

I must do my part for the honor 

of my house  wouldn t you agree  

 i But how   i  

Well  my brother 

has his sword 

and I have my mind. 

And a mind needs books 

like a sword needs a whetstone. 

That s why I read 

so much  Jon Snow. 

And you  

What s your story  

bastard  

Ask me nicely and maybe 

I ll tell you  dwarf. 

A bastard boy 

with nothing to inherit  

 i off to join  i  

 i the ancient order  i  

 i of The Night s Watch   i  

alongside his Valiant 

brothers in arms. 

The Night s Watch protects 

the realm from   

ah  yes yes  against grumpkins 

and snarks 

and all the other monsters 

your wet nurse warned you about. 

 i You re a smart boy.  i  

You don t believe 

that nonsense. 

Everything s better 

with some wine in the belly. 

It s time we reviewed 

the accounts  my lady. 

You ll want to know how much 

this royal visit has cost us. 

Talk to Poole about it. 

Poole went south 

with Lord Stark  my lady. 

 i We need a new steward   i  

and there are several other 

appointments that require 

  our immediate attention   

  I don t care about appointments  

I ll make the appointments. 

We ll talk about it 

first thing in the morning. 

Very good  my Lord. 

My Lady. 

When was the last time 

you left this room  

I have to take care 

of him. 

He s not going 

to die  mother. 

Maester Luwin says the most 

dangerous time has passed. 

 i What if he s wrong   i  

  Bran needs me. 

   i Rickon needs you.  i  

He s six. 

He doesn t know what s happening. 

He follows me around all day  

  clutching my leg  crying   

  close the windows  

I can t stand it  

Please make them stop  

Fire. 

You stay here. 

I ll come back. 

You re not supposed 

to be here. 

No one is 

supposed to be here. 

It s a mercy. 

He s dead already. 

No  

  Have you ever seen a dragon  

  Dragon gone  Khaleesi. 

 i Everywhere   i  

 i Even in the east   i  

 i No dragon.  i  

 i Brave men kill them.  i  

   i It is known.  i  

  It is known. 

A trader from Garth told me 

that dragons come from the moon. 

The moon  

He told me the moon 

was an egg  Khaleesi  

 i that once there were  i  

 i two moons in the sky.  i  

But one wandered too close 

to the sun and it cracked from the heat. 

Out of it poured a thousand 

thousand dragons 

and they drank 

the sun s fire. 

Moon is no egg. 

Moon is goddess   

wife of sun. 

  It is known. 

  It is known. 

Leave me with her. 

Why did the trader from Garth 

tell you these stories  

Men like to talk 

when they re happy. 

Before your brother 

bought me for you  

it was my job 

to make men happy. 

  How old were you  

  I was nine 

when my mother sold me 

to the pleasure house. 

Nine   

I did not touch a man 

for three years  Khaleesi. 

First 

you must learn. 

Can you teach me how 

to make the Khal happy  

  Yes. 

  Will it take three years  

No. 

Welcome. 

What I am about to tell 

you must remain between us. 

I don t think Bran 

fell from that tower. 

I think he was thrown. 

The boy was always 

sure footed before. 

Someone tried 

to kill him twice. 

 i Why   i  

 i Why murder an innocent child   i  

Unless he saw something 

he wasn t meant to see. 

  Saw what  my lady  

  I don t know. 

 i But I would stake my life  i  

 i the Lannisters are involved.  i  

We already have reason 

to suspect their loyalty to the crown. 

Did you notice the dagger 

the killer used  

It s too fine a weapon 

for such a man. 

The blade is Valyrian steel  

the handle dragonbone. 

Someone gave it to him. 

They come into our home 

and try to murder my brother  

If it s war they want   

If it comes to that  you know 

I ll stand behind you. 

What  is there going to be 

a battle in the Godswood  

 i Huh   i  

Too easily words of war 

become acts of war. 

 i We don t know  i  

 i the truth yet.  i  

Lord Stark 

must be told of this. 

I don t trust a raven 

to carry these words. 

  I ll ride to King s Landing. 

  No. 

There must always be 

a Stark in Winterfell. 

  I will go myself. 

  Mother  you can t. 

I must. 

I ll send hal with a squad 

of guardsmen to escort you. 

Too large a party attracts 

unwanted attention. 

I don t want the Lannisters 

to know I m coming. 

Let me accompany you 

at least. 

 i The Kingsroad can be a  i  

 i dangerous place for a woman alone.  i  

What about Bran  

I have prayed to the seven 

for more than a month. 

 i Bran s life is  i  

 i in their hands now.  i  

No  Khaleesi. 

You must look 

in his eyes always. 

Love comes in at the eyes. 

It is said that Irogenia of Lys 

could finish a man 

with nothing 

but her eyes. 

Finish a man  

Oh. 

Kings traveled across 

the world for a night with Irogenia. 

Magisters sold 

their palaces. 

 i Khals burned her enemies  i  

 i just to have her for a few hours.  i  

They say a thousand men 

proposed to her 

and she refused them all. 

Well  she sounds like 

an interesting woman. 

I   I don t think 

that Drogo will like it 

with me on top. 

You will make him 

like it  Khaleesi. 

Men want what 

they ve never had. 

And the Dothraki take slaves 

like a hound takes a bitch. 

Are you a slave  

Khaleesi  

Then don t make love 

like a slave. 

Very good  Khaleesi. 

Out there 

he is the mighty Khal  

 i but in this tent   i  

 i he belongs to you.  i  

I   I don t think 

that this is 

the Dothraki way. 

If he wanted 

the Dothraki way  

why did he marry you  

No. 

No  

 i Ajjalan anha zalat  i  

 i vitiherat yer hatif.  i  

Pardon me  Ser. 

Do I frighten you 

so much  girl  

Or is it him there 

making you shake  

He frightens 

me too. 

Look at 

that face. 

I m sorry 

if I offended you  Ser. 

Why won t he speak to me  

He hasn t been very talkative 

these last  years. 

Since the mad King had his tongue 

ripped out with hot pincers. 

He speaks damn well 

with his sword though. 

Ser Ilyn Payne  

the King s justice. 

The royal 

executioner. 

What is it  sweet lady  

Does the hound frighten you  

Away with you  dog. 

You re scaring 

my lady. 

I don t like 

to see you upset. 

The Sun is finally shining. 

Come walk with me. 

Stay  lady. 

I probably shouldn t 

have any more. 

Father only lets us 

have one cup at feasts. 

My princess can drink 

as much as she wants. 

Don t worry   

you re safe with me. 

I ll get you  

  Arya  

  Ow  

What are you doing here  

  Go away. 

  Your sister  

  And who are you  boy  

  Mycah  my Lord. 

  He the butcher s boy. 

  He s my friend. 

A butcher s boy who wants 

to be a Knight  eh  

Pick up your sword  butcher s boy. 

Let s see how good you are. 

She asked me to  my Lord. 

She asked me to. 

I m your prince  

not your lord  

and I said pick up 

your sword. 

It s not a sword  my prince. 

It s only a stick. 

And you re not a Knight. 

Only a butcher s boy. 

That was my lady s sister 

you were hitting  do you know that  

  Stop it  

  Arya  stay out of this. 

I won t hurt him... 

Much. 

Arya  

Filthy little bitch  

No no  stop it  stop it  

both of you. 

You re spoiling it. 

You re spoiling everything  

I ll gut you  

you little cunt  

  Arya  

  Nymeria  

  Arya  

  Nymeria  

No. 

No. 

Please don t. 

Arya  leave him alone. 

My prince  my poor prince  

look what they did to you. 

Stay here  I ll go back 

to the inn and bring help. 

Then go  

Don t touch me. 

 i The wolf s not here. 

Look down by the stream.  i  

You ve got to go. They ll kill you for 

what you did to Joffrey. 

Go on   run. 

Go  

Leave now  

   i It s a direwolf.  i  

   i I ll check down here.  i  

 i I think I heard a noise.  i  

 i Go   i  

 i Arya   i  

  Distant man   i Arya   i  

  Ned   i Arya   i  

 i Arya aa   i  

Arya  

 i Arya   i  

My lord  

My lord  

They found her. 

She s unharmed. 

Where is she  

She s been taken 

directly before the King. 

  Who took her  

  The Lannisters found her. 

   i Arya aa   i  

  Right  get back. 

 i The Queen ordered  i  

 i them to bring her straight to him.  i  

Back  

Back to the inn. 

All back  

I m sorry  I m sorry  

I m sorry. 

 i   Are you hurt   i  

 i   No.  i  

Oh  it s all right. 

What is 

the meaning of this  

Why was my daughter 

not brought to me at once  

How dare you speak 

to your King in that manner  

Quiet  woman. 

Sorry  Ned. 

I never meant to frighten the girl. 

But we need to get 

this business done quickly. 

Your girl and that butcher s boy 

attacked my son. 

That animal of hers 

nearly tore his arm off. 

That s not true  

She just... 

Bit him a little. 

  He was hurting Mycah. 

  Joff told us what happened. 

You and that boy 

beat him with clubs 

  while you set your wolf on him. 

  That s not what happened  

Yes it is  

They all attacked me and she 

threw my sword in the river. 

  Liar  

  Shut up  

 i Enough   i  

He tells me one thing  

she tells me another. 

Seven hells  

What am I to make of this  

Where s your 

other daughter  Ned  

In bed asleep. 

She s not. 

Sansa  come here  darling. 

Now  child... 

Tell me what happened. 

Tell it all 

and tell it true. 

It s a great crime 

to lie to a King. 

I don t know. 

I don t remember. 

Everything happened so fast. 

  I didn t see. 

  Liar  

  Liar liar liar  

  Arya  

  Hey  stop it  That s enough of that. 

  Liar liar liar  

  Stop  Arya  

  She s as wild as that animal of hers. 

 i I want her punished.  i  

What would you have me do  

whip her through the streets  

Damn it  children fight. 

It s over. 

Joffrey will bear these scars 

for the rest of his life. 

You let that 

little girl disarm you  

Ned  see to it that 

your daughter is disciplined. 

  I ll do the same with my son. 

  Gladly  your Grace. 

And what of the direwolf  

What of the beast 

that savaged your son  

I d forgot 

the damned wolf. 

We found no trace 

of the direwolf  your Grace. 

No  

So be it. 

We have another wolf. 

As you will. 

  You can t mean it. 

  A direwolf s no pet. 

Get her a dog. 

She ll be happier for it. 

He doesn t mean Lady  

does he  

No no  not lady  

Lady didn t bite anyone  

  She s good  

  Lady wasn t there  

   i You leave her alone   i  

  Stop them. Don t let them do it. 

Please please  

it wasn t Lady  

Is this your command   

your Grace  

  Where is the beast  

  Chained up outside  your Grace. 

Ser Ilyn  

do me the honor. 

No. 

Jory... 

Take the girls 

to their rooms. 

If it must be done  

then I ll do it myself. 

Is this some trick  

The wolf is of the north. 

She deserves better 

than a butcher. 

The butcher s boy   

you rode him down  

He ran... 

Not very fast. 

Theon   i Maester Luwin   i  

 i send a raven to Pyke  i  

informing my father 

of my victory here. 

And one to Deepwood Motte 

to my sister. 

Inform her that she s to 

bring  men to Winterfell. 

When do we sail 

for King s Landing  

Soon as I ve consolidated 

my troops. 

And you lead the fleet 

into Blackwater Bay. 

The fist of the First Men. 

Thousands of years ago 

the First Men stood here. 

They came here to get 

away from something. 

And I don t think 

it worked. 

Cersei   i Do you really think I ll let  i  

 i you ship Myrcella off to Dorne   i  

Dorne is the safest 

place for her. 

I want you to know what 

it s like to love someone  

to truly love someone 

before I take her from you. 

You let a halfwit escape

 i And Rickon  too   i  

 i The little one   i  

 i Gone  along with  i  

 i the wildling woman.  i  

Wait  I know that farm. 

  They ll give us some food. 

  We can t risk it. 

I ve been treating 

your wounded men. 

 i I ve already run through the  i  

 i supplies I brought with me.  i  

You re riding to the Crag 

to negotiate a surrender. 

Come with me to the Crag. Let 

the Maester show you his stores. 

  Grunts   

  Whistles   

Should have took me 

while you had the chance. 

Catelyn  

 i They want your head.  i  

Old Lord Karstark 

doesn t seem to like me. 

You strangled his son 

with your chains. 

  He was in my way. 

  You are a man without honor. 

Brienne  your sword. 

You have my dragons  

I will take you to 

the House of the Undying 

where I have put them. 

  Groans   

Your dragons wait for you 

in the House of the Undying. 

I told you what would happen 

if you served me loyally 

 i and what would happen  i  

 i if you did not.  i  

What have you done

 i you who still question  i

    Men laugh   

  Envy isn t attractive. 

  What envy  

You should be proud 

of your brother s achievement. 

I took the great castle 

of Winterfell with  men. 

You re a great warrior. 

I saw the bodies 

above your gates. 

Which one gave you 

the tougher fight  

the cripple or 

the six year old  

  Men laugh   

I treated the Stark 

boys with honor 

and they repaid me 

with treachery. 

You treated them with honor 

by butchering them  

Before I had to kill them  

I treated them   

you seized their home  

as is your right. 

  We re Ironborn  We take what we need. 

  Exactly. 

Then you made them prisoners in 

their home and they ran away. 

Is that treachery  

I d call it bravery. 

They made me a promise   

Your little boy prisoners 

made you a promise 

and you got mad 

when they broke it  

Are you the dumbest 

cunt alive  

  Don t call me a   

  A cunt. 

A dumb cunt who killed 

the only two Starks in Winterfell. 

You know how valuable 

those boys were  

If I hadn t killed them  the 

Northerners would think me weak. 

You are weak. 

And you re stupid. 

I m warning you. 

Go on  then  

warn me. 

You haven t brought 

enough men. 

How am I supposed to defend 

Winterfell with just this lot  

You re not. I ve come to bring 

you home. 

  Father wants a word. 

  Is this a joke  

Winterfell is the heart 

of the North. 

Aye  it is  hundreds of miles 

from the sea. 

We re islanders  

baby brother. 

 i Had you forgotten that   i  

 i Our power comes  i  

 i from our ships.  i  

 i And now that you ve  i  

 i decorated your walls  i  

 i with the bodies  i  

 i of the Stark boys   i  

every man in the North 

wants to see you hanged. 

When Robb Stark 

finds out   

He won t find out. 

We ve killed all the ravens. 

We have all the horses. 

I ve taken Winterfell. 

And I will keep Winterfell. 

Leave us. 

Theon  you re my blood. 

We both loved our mother. 

We both endured 

our father. 

Come home with me. 

Don t die here alone. 

I don t intend to die. 

You were a terrible baby  

do you know that  

Bawling all the time  

never sleeping. 

And one night you just 

wouldn t shut up  

screaming like a dying pig. 

I walked over to your crib  

I looked down at you. 

I wanted to strangle you. 

And you looked up at me 

and you stopped screaming. 

You smiled at me. 

Don t die 

so far from the sea. 

I ve brought you 

a present  Lord of Bones. 

I already got one crow. 

Don t need two. 

Mance will want 

to question this one. 

 i Knows all about where the crows  i  

 i are and what they re planning.  i  

The Halfhand knows more. 

This one is just a little boy. 

Gut him. 

He could have killed me 

half a dozen times. 

And now he wishes he did. 

Gut him. 

He s a bastard of Winterfell  

Ned Stark s son. 

Mance will want him. 

What does Mance want 

with a dead man s bastard  

I don t know. 

I think he ll want 

to decide for himself. 

He runs  I ll chop 

his balls off. 

He runs  

I ll do it meself. 

We re even now  

Jon Snow. 

I couldn t do it. 

I had the sword at her neck  

I just couldn t   

  I know. 

  The others  

When you didn t come back  

we went looking for you. 

We found your tracks 

fast enough. 

But they found us 

before we found you. 

They died because of me. 

See that it wasn t 

for nothing. 

All right  up  lad. 

Come on  

on your feet  now. 

Move it. 

 i   Birds calling   i  

 i water burbling    i  

Is she beautiful  

I ve never met her. 

What s her name  

Frey  I suppose. 

I don t know 

her first name. 

I m sure you ll 

be very happy. 

  Both laugh   

And you re marrying 

her for a bridge  

  An important bridge. 

  Ah. 

It was before 

they killed my father. 

I still thought I could march south 

and rescue him in time  

but only if I crossed 

that bridge. 

When I speak to people 

from the North  

they all loved 

your father. 

He was the best man 

I ever met. 

I know children always think 

that about their fathers  but   

Children do not always think that 

about their fathers  

believe me. 

He once told me that being 

a Lord is like being a father  

except you have 

thousands of children 

and you worry about 

all of them. 

The farmers plowing 

the fields are yours to protect. 

The charwomen scrubbing the floors  

yours to protect. 

The soldiers 

you order into battle. 

He told me he woke 

with fear in the morning 

and went to bed 

with fear in the night. 

I didn t believe him. 

I asked him  

 how can a man be brave 

if he s afraid   

 That is the only time 

a man can be brave   he told me. 

I wish I could have 

met him. 

He would have 

liked you. 

Most Lords worry more 

about their gold 

and their glory than the charwomen 

scrubbing their floors. 

He didn t care much 

about gold or glory. 

And you  

You think I m fighting this war so 

they ll sing songs about me  

I want to go home. 

I want the men 

following me to go home. 

Then why don t you  

Because we ll never be safe until 

the Lannisters are defeated. 

And because I believe 

in justice. 

Chopping off 

Joffrey s head  you mean. 

That would be a start. 

 i   Horse neighs   i  

 i hoofbeats approaching    i  

Your Grace  Milady. 

The Kingslayer  

he escaped in the night. 

How  

How   

Tell me this isn t true. 

Why  

  For the girls. 

  You betrayed me. 

  Robb   

  No  

You knew I would 

not allow it 

and you did it 

anyway. 

Bran and Rickon 

are captives in Winterfell. 

Sansa and Arya are captives 

in King s Landing. 

I have five children  

and only one of them is free. 

I lost one son fighting 

by your son s side. 

I lost another 

to the Kingslayer  

strangled with a chain. 

You commit treason 

 i because your children  i  

 i are prisoners   i  

 i I would carve out  i  

 i my heart  i  

and offer it to the father 

if he would let my sons 

wake from their graves 

and step into a prison cell. 

I grieve for 

your sons  My Lord. 

I don t want your grief. 

I want my vengeance. 

And you stole it 

from me. 

Killing Jaime Lannister 

would not buy life 

for your children  

but returning him 

to King s Landing 

may buy life 

for mine. 

Jaime Lannister has played 

you for a fool. 

You ve weakened 

our position. 

You ve brought discord 

into our camp. 

And you did it all 

behind my back. 

Make sure she s guarded 

day and night. 

Robb. 

How many men did we send 

in pursuit of the Kingslayer  

  Your Grace. 

Send another  

with our fastest horses. 

Robb. 

  Neighing   

Whoa  oof  

  Groans   

Damn. 

You re much uglier 

in daylight. 

What s your name  

I m Jaime Lannister 

of Casterly Rock  

son of Tywin. 

A captive Knight has a right 

to know his captor s identity. 

Brienne of Tarth. 

Tarth  Tarth  Tarth. 

Crescent moons 

and starbursts. 

Lord... Selwyn Tarth  

your father. 

Do you have any brothers 

and sisters  My Lady  

It s a long way 

to King s Landing. 

Might as well get 

to know one another. 

Have you known many men  

I suppose not. 

Women  

Horses  

Ah  

I didn t mean to give 

offense  My Lady. 

Forgive me. 

Your crimes are past 

forgiveness  Kingslayer. 

Why do you 

hate me so much  

   i Have I ever harmed you   i  

   i You ve harmed others    i  

 i those you were  i  

 i sworn to protect   i  

the weak  

the innocent. 

Has anyone ever told you you re 

as boring as you are ugly  

You will not 

provoke me to anger. 

I already have. 

Look at you. 

You re ready 

to chop my head off. 

Do you think 

you could  

Do you think you could 

beat me in a fair fight  

I ve never 

seen you fight. 

The answer is no. 

There are three men 

in the kingdoms who might 

have a chance against me. 

You re not one of them. 

All my life men like you 

have sneered at me. 

And all my life I ve been knocking 

men like you into the dust. 

If you re so confident  

unlock my chains. 

Let s see what happens. 

Do you take me 

for an idiot  In. 

I took you 

for a fighter  

a man   pardon   

woman of honor. 

Was I wrong  

You re afraid. 

Maybe one day 

we ll find out  Kingslayer. 

Kevan   i King s Landing  i  

 i will fall an hour  i  

 i after Stannis  i  

 i lands his force.  i  

 i It s not too late for  i  

 i King Joffrey and Cersei  i  

 i and the court  i  

 i to ride west to safety.  i  

Surrender the Iron Throne  

Better than seeing their heads 

mounted on the city gates. 

Stannis will 

execute them all. 

No  a king who runs 

will not be king for long. 

He s a Lannister. 

He ll stand and fight. 

Stannis  two days 

from the capital 

and the wolf 

at my doorstep. 

The scouts assure us Robb Stark 

remains north of Ashemark. 

Ha  The last time 

the scouts assured us 

of Stark s movement  

he lured us into a trap. 

 i Which is why my son  i  

 i is his prisoner.  i  

 i Too close  i  

 i to Casterly Rock.  i  

He sent a splinter force 

to recapture Winterfell. 

The Greyjoys have 

done us a great favor. 

Stark won t risk marching 

on Casterly Rock 

until he s at full force. 

He s a boy and he s 

never lost a battle. 

He ll risk anything 

at any time 

 i because he doesn t know  i  

 i enough to be afraid.  i  

We ll ride at nightfall. 

 i I want a full night s march before  i  

 i he knows we re on the move.  i  

Clegane  you ll maintain 

a garrison here at Harrenhal. 

Track down this brotherhood 

and destroy them. 

The girl has proven 

herself a good servant. 

 i She ll stay on with you.  i  

 i See that he doesn t get  i  

 i drunk in the evenings.  i  

He s poor company 

when he s sober  

but he s better 

at his work. 

You ve got some 

questions to answer. 

Man  

 i Who killed Ser Amory   i  

  Man    I don t know  

   i Give me the name.  i  

  Man    Please  

  Man     i Take this one out for the crows.  i  

Man    

 i I told you  I don t know.  i  

 i Please.  i  

Look  it s Yoren s 

little cunt. 

Used to be a boy  

now it s a girl. 

    Man laughs   

  Where s Jaqen  

Don t care. 

Where s your stick 

now  bitch  

I promised 

to fuck you with it. 

Guard   i Come on  time to kill  i  

 i some wolves.  i  

 i   Men shouting    i  

You need sour cherries 

to make it right. 

 i And the secret is you dry  i  

 i the stones  and then you  i  

 i break them with a mallet.  i  

 i That s where  i  

 i the real flavor is.  i  

 i You crush  em up real fine.  i  

And then when you re finished  

you sprinkle them over the piecrust. 

  Where s Jaqen  

  How would I know  

I need him now. 

Lord Tywin s 

marching tonight. 

  You need him  

  He s helping me. 

  Hot Pie  I saw him. 

  Where  

  Where   

  Ow  

Where  

They went riding out 

the gates a few hours ago. 

On patrol. 

Let go of my ears. 

 i   Horses neighing   i  

 i men shouting    i  

What do you want 

with him anyway  

 i   Men shouting    i  

  Wind howling   

Qhorin  Mance is gonna 

march on the Wall. 

When he does  one brother 

inside his army 

will be worth   

fighting against it. 

  They ll never trust me. 

  They might... 

  If you do what needs to be done. 

  What  

How does it feel knowing 

those men all died 

so you could skip through the 

snow with your little savage girl  

I didn t. 

I should have known better  

trusting a traitor s bastard. 

He s not yours 

to kill  crow. 

Do you have 

to do that here  

I like to keep 

me hands clean. 

Yes  but do you 

have to do it here  

You should start wearing 

the gold cloak. 

I don t want to wear 

a gold cloak. 

 i You re commander  i  

 i of the City Watch.  i  

You shouldn t be dressed 

like a common sellsword. 

A cloak slows you down 

in a fight  

makes it hard 

to move quietly. 

And the gold 

catches the light  

so you re nice and easy 

to spot at night. 

Well  you re not sneaking 

through alleyways any longer. 

You re supposed 

to stand out. 

We had a deal  and wearing 

a gold cloak wasn t part of it. 

Fine  fine. 

No gold cloak. 

  What  

  What  

What  What  

Why are you staring at me  

  Scoffs   You don t want me 

cleaning me nails. 

You don t want me 

looking your way. 

Why am I here  

To help me plan the defense 

of King s Landing. 

  Laughs   

Stannis will be here 

any day. 

  Sighs   

And one of these 

explains how to beat him  

 An History of the Great 

Sieges of Westeros  

by Archmaester 

 Shevelathin.  

 Shevelatesh.  

 Chevalteesh.  

I d swap all your books 

for a few good archers. 

My Lord Hand  

Commander. 

I must compliment you 

on the Gold Cloaks  performance 

these last few weeks. 

Did you know there has been 

a marked drop in thievery  

I did not know. 

And how did you accomplish 

this marked drop in thievery  

Me and the lads rounded up 

all the known thieves. 

For questioning  

 i Uh  no.  i  

It s just the unknown thieves 

we need to worry about now. 

  We talked about this. 

  Aye  we talked about it. 

Have you ever been 

in a city under siege  

Maybe this part s 

not in your books. 

See  it s not the fighting 

that kills most people. 

It s the starving. 

Food s worth more than gold. 

Noble ladies sell their diamonds 

for a sack of potatoes. 

Things get bad enough  

the poor start 

eating each other. 

 i The thieves   i  

 i they love a siege.  i  

Soon as the gates are sealed  

they steal all the food. 

By the time it s all over  

they re the richest men in town. 

Given the circumstances  

My Lord  

I believe extreme measures 

are warranted. 

Ah. 

 The Great Sieges 

of Westeros.  

Thrilling subject. 

Shame Archmaester Ch vyalthan 

wasn t a better writer. 

Stannis knows 

King s Landing. 

He knows where the walls 

are strongest 

and he knows which gates 

are weakest. 

The mud gate. 

A good ram will batter it 

down in minutes 

 i and it s only  yards  i  

 i from the water.  i  

That s where he ll land. 

And if Stannis does 

attack the mud gate  

what is our plan  

We could throw 

books at his men. 

We don t have 

that many books. 

We don t have 

that many men  either. 

What do we have  

Pig shit. 

  Wind howling   

  Chatter   

  Panting   

I m not cut out 

for this sort of work. 

I always imagined meself 

doing something much worse. 

We re digging latrine pits 

at the end of the world. 

I can t imagine 

anything much worse. 

Dolorous Edd  

 i You lack imagination.  i  

Sam   i Where do you think  i  

 i Jon is right now   i  

He went off with the Halfhand. 

He didn t come back. 

A betting man 

would go with dead. 

He s not dead. 

No  Jon s a great 

fighter. 

Well  he s better 

than me 

and a lot better 

than you. 

He s got a Valyrian 

steel sword. 

So did his father. 

And Qhorin Halfhand 

is the greatest ranger alive. 

Great rangers never 

get old is the problem. 

Shit ones neither. 

It s them in the middle 

that last a long time. 

  Clangs   

What in seven hells 

is that  

The First Men 

made these marks. 

Help me with it. 

  Straining   

Look. 

If you find something 

you re not supposed to  

best thing to do is pretend 

you ve never seen it. 

That s a Night s 

Watch cloak. 

It s been here 

a long time. 

Oh  must be Dragonglass. 

Grenn  

 i Dragonglass   i  

The Maesters 

call it Obsidian. 

Why would a brother 

hide it here  

I expect it s  cause 

he wanted somebody to find it. 

Mind where you re going. 

I m sorry. 

I ll   

  where were you  

  A man has patrol duty. 

Tywin Lannister 

was right here 

and now he s gone. 

A girl owes 

one more name. 

The Red God demands it. 

Give the man a name. 

How long after 

I give you the name 

does it take you 

to kill someone  

A minute  an hour  

a month. 

Death is certain  

the time is not. 

He s taking his army 

to attack my brother. 

I need him dead 

right now. 

This a man 

cannot do. 

You promised 

you d help me. 

Help was not promised  

lovely girl. 

Only death. 

There must be others. 

Give a name  

any name. 

And you ll kill them  

Anybody  

By the seven New Gods 

and the Old Gods beyond counting  

I swear it. 

All right. 

Jaqen H ghar. 

A girl gives a man 

his own name  

  That s right. 

   i Gods are not mocked.  i  

  This is no joking thing. 

  I m not joking. 

A man can go kill himself. 

  Un name me. 

  No. 

Please  

I ll un name you. 

Thank you. 

If you help me 

and my friends escape. 

 i This would require  i  

 i more than one life.  i  

   i This is not part of our bargain.  i  

  Fine  Jaqen H ghar. 

A girl lacks honor. 

If I do this thing  

a girl must obey. 

A girl will obey. 

A girl and her friends will walk 

through the gate at midnight. 

Thank you  Podrick. 

Odd little boy. 

I have a certain sympathy 

for odd little boys. 

You and Varys both. 

Excellent lamprey pie. 

Were you slaving away 

in the kitchen all day  

I hear Joffrey 

plans on fighting. 

An inspiration 

for the troops. 

The young king 

in his shining armor 

fighting to defend the capital 

against the wicked old rebel. 

He s only a boy. 

Younger boys are off 

fighting his war. 

He s not ready. 

What is he    

  Remember Jaime at   

  Better than you. 

Some men have a gift 

for this sort of thing  

some don t. 

His place is not 

on the battlefield. 

It s not on 

the throne  either  

sadly for all of us. 

Do you think 

I m an idiot  

No  I d say you possess 

above average intelligence. 

You shipped off 

my only daughter. 

And now you want to send my 

eldest son to the battlefield to die. 

He ll have his Kingsguard 

protecting him. 

He has the finest armor 

gold can buy. 

He needs to be out there. 

The men will fight more 

fiercely seeing their king 

fighting beside them 

instead of hiding behind 

his mother s skirts. 

Any dessert  

Do you know why 

Varys is so dangerous  

Because he has thousands 

of spies in his employ. 

Because he knows everything 

we do before we do it. 

Because he doesn t 

have a cock. 

Neither do you. 

Perhaps I m dangerous  too. 

You  on the other hand  

are as big a fool 

as every other man. 

That little worm 

between your legs 

does half your thinking. 

  It s not that little. 

    Laughs   

Why are you smiling  

Because I m happy. 

And why are you happy  

Because I have 

your little whore. 

I thought you 

preferred blondes. 

Such a droll little fellow. 

Tell me  have you 

married this one yet  

No  

Oh  good. 

Father will be so pleased. 

Why do you care 

who I fuck  

Because a Lannister 

always pays her debts. 

You stole my only daughter  

you plot to have 

Joffrey killed. 

This is madness. 

Stannis will be here in days. 

  You need me. 

  For what  

Your skill in battle  

Pretty thing  your whore. 

Lovely body. 

The bruises 

will heal in time. 

Where did you find her  

Varys isn t the only one 

who hears whispers. 

Really  a Lannister 

lion necklace  

You need to hide your secret whores 

more carefully. 

You ve forgotten the most 

important thing about whores. 

Oh  

Well  you re the expert. 

Tell me. 

You don t buy them  

You only rent them. 

You re usually a better liar  

baby brother. 

This one you like. 

You like her very much. 

Could it be love  

Don t worry  she ll be treated 

gently enough... 

unless Joffrey is hurt. 

And then every wound 

he suffers she ll suffer  too. 

And if he dies  

there isn t a man alive 

who could devise 

a more painful death 

for your little cunt. 

And how do I know you 

haven t killed her already  

Would you like to see her  

I thought you might. 

Ser Mandon  bring in 

my brother s whore. 

I m sorry they hurt you. 

You must be brave. 

I promise 

I will free you. 

Don t forget me. 

Never. 

 i   Door opens  closes    i  

I will hurt you 

for this. 

A day will come when you 

think you re safe and happy 

and your joy will turn 

to ashes in your mouth. 

And you will know 

the debt is paid. 

Get out. 

Shae  

I ve been waiting 

all night. 

What is wrong  

You re beautiful. 

Then why do you look sad  

We have to be 

more careful. 

Don t be afraid. 

I can take care of myself. 

There are people 

who want to hurt me. 

I know. 

I won t let them. 

I ll cut off their faces. 

I will. 

I would kill for you. 

Do you know that  

I expect I ll have to 

before this is over. 

You re mine. 

I m yours. 

Promise me. 

I m yours  

and you are mine. 

Robb  

 i Still no word   i  

We ve sent 

a dozen ravens. 

None have returned. 

My bastard is only 

a few days from Winterfell. 

  Once he captures the castle   

  Theon has my brothers. 

  If we storm the castle   

  He wouldn t dare hurt the boys. 

They re his only hope of escaping 

the North with his head. 

Send word to your son. 

Any Ironborn who surrender 

will be allowed to return 

safely to their homes. 

A touch of mercy is a virtue  

Your Grace. Too much   

Any ironborn with the exception 

of Theon Greyjoy. 

He betrayed our cause. 

He betrayed me. 

And we will hunt him down 

no matter where he runs. 

I expect his countrymen 

will turn on him the minute 

they hear the offer. 

Your pardon  My Lord. 

Your Grace. 

My Lady. 

How are you  

How am I  

I ve had to arrest 

my mother. 

The Lannisters 

have my sisters. 

The man I considered 

my closest friend 

has seized my home 

and my brothers. 

I m fighting a war and I don t know 

if I should march south or north. 

I m sorry. 

It was a stupid question. 

  I m sorry. 

  No. 

Forgive me. 

You re being kind. 

I have no right. 

You have every right. 

You re a king. 

That s not the kind 

of king I want to be. 

What kind do you 

want to be  

I don t know. 

The good kind. 

Most kings grew up 

as princes. 

They spend their whole lives 

preparing for the crown. 

I was raised to be 

Lord of Winterfell. 

I was raised to be 

a proper little lady  

to play the harp 

and dance the latest steps 

and recite 

Valyrian poetry. 

I d like to hear you 

play the harp. 

No. 

No  you would not. 

  Laughs   

How did you go from 

reciting Valyrian poetry 

to sawing off 

men s feet  

When I was   

my mother and father 

went to a wedding. 

Weddings in Volantis 

last for days  you know. 

And they left me 

with my little brother. 

The second afternoon 

they were gone 

was the hottest day 

in the three year summer. 

We couldn t bear to be inside  

so we ran down to the Rhoyne. 

Every child in Volantis 

was in the Rhoyne that day. 

 i The rich  the poor   i  

 i we were all there   i  

naked  screaming  racing 

to the little islands. 

Drummers were playing 

for coppers on the east bank. 

I was treading water  

talking to a friend 

when I realized 

I hadn t seen my brother. 

I called his name. 

Then I started 

screaming his name. 

And then I saw him 

floating facedown. 

My heart just... 

stopped. 

I was... 

I dragged him 

from the water. 

My friend helped me  

I think. 

I don t even remember. 

He was so little. 

Then we pulled him 

onto the riverbank... 

and I screamed at him 

and I shook him 

and he was dead. 

Just dead. 

A man ran over. 

He had a fish 

tattoo on his face. 

In Volantis the slaves 

have tattoos 

so you know what they are 

without having to talk to them. 

And this man worked 

on a fishing boat. 

And he pushed me 

out of the way. 

You have to understand  

for a slave to push 

a highborn girl   

that s death for the man  

a terrible death. 

But he pushed me 

out of the way 

and he started pressing 

on my brother s chest 

again and again 

and again 

until my brother 

spat out 

half of the Rhoyne 

and cried out. 

And the man cradled his head 

and told him to be calm. 

I decided 

two things that day. 

I would not 

waste my years 

planning dances and masquerades 

with the other noble ladies. 

And when 

I came of age... 

I would never live 

in a slave city again. 

  Sighs   

I m sorry  Your Grace. 

You told me of your problems 

and I ve blathered on. 

I don t want to marry 

the Frey girl. 

I don t want you 

to marry her. 

But you needed 

that bridge. 

I hope it s a very 

beautiful bridge. 

  Laughs   

Hot Pie   i The sour cherries was all  i  

 i crushed up and ready.  i  

Gendry   i Shut up.  i  

 i Probably in the piecrust  i  

 i by now.  i  

In the oven  

the nice warm oven. 

Shut up. 

What did you bring  

The cheese 

could be better. 

I did get some 

nice sausages. 

What did he want us 

to do about those guards  

He didn t say. 

He just said  

 walk through the gates. 

Gendry  

 i What about the guards   i  

 i He didn t say anything  i  

 i about the guards.  i  

What  he left that bit out  

It s a pretty important part  

don t you think  

  We have to trust him. 

   i Trust him   i  

You trusted him to fight with us 

and you set him free 

  and he ran. 

  I want to go back to the kitchens. 

Shut up. 

Stay here if you re afraid. 

Hot Pie  

Arry  don t. 

Away  

Reset  

If the wind holds  we ll reach 

King s Landing in a day. 

Will it hold  

Can t make promises 

for the wind  Your Grace. 

Man  

 i Again  pull   i  

I admire you  Ser Davos. 

I thank you  Your Grace. 

Pleased to hear it. 

Some highborn fools 

call you Onion Knight 

and think 

they insult you. 

So you take the onion 

for your sigil  

sew it on your coat  

fly the onion flag. 

My son wishes me 

to change it. 

Three mermen with tridents  

something like that. 

I understand why the older 

families look down at me. 

Do you  

Why  

  My father was a crabber. 

  And  

Well  sons of Lords don t like to 

break bread with sons of crabbers. 

Our hands stink. 

And where were those Lords 

when Storm s End starved  

Many fought bravely 

for your brother. 

Many fought 

for the Mad King. 

You defend these men 

who insult you behind your back. 

Some are happy 

to do it to my face. 

We were forgotten. 

Robert and Ned Stark   

they were the heroes  

the glorious rebels marching 

from battle to battle  

liberating towns from 

the yoke of the Mad King 

while I held Storm s End 

with  men. 

  No one has forgotten  Your Grace. 

  No  Robert did. 

He gave Storm s End 

to Renly after the war. 

Renly never fought 

a day in his life. 

  He was only a boy. 

  Then why d he give him Storm s End  

First we ate the horses. 

We weren t riding anyway  

not with the castle surrounded. 

We couldn t feed them  

so fine  the horses. 

Then the cats. 

Never liked cats. 

So fine. 

I do like dogs. 

Good animals. 

Loyal. 

But we ate them. 

Then the rats. 

The night before 

you slipped through  

I thought my wife 

was dying. 

She couldn t speak anymore  

she was so frail. 

And then you made it 

through the lines. 

Slipped right through in your little 

black sailboat with your onions. 

And potatoes. 

Some salted beef  I believe. 

Every man in Storm s End 

wanted to kiss you that night. 

I was relieved 

they did not. 

Robert told me to hold 

Storm s End  so I held it. 

Then he told me 

he was giving it to Renly  

so I gave it up. 

Insult or no  

I gave it up 

because Robert was my older brother 

and he was the king 

and I ve always 

done my duty. 

But now I m the rightful king by 

every law of Westeros. 

And when I sit the Iron Throne  

you ll be my Hand. 

Your Grace... 

I pray I serve you well. 

I expect you ll be the first crabber s 

son to wear the badge. 

You re the master 

of whisperers. 

You re supposed 

to know everything. 

No man can be in all 

rooms at all times. 

I have many little birds 

in the North  My Lord  

but I haven t heard 

their songs 

since Theon Greyjoy 

captured Winterfell. 

The Stark forces 

are distracted. 

Now is the time 

to strike. 

To strike  

My dear nephew  

you do see these men 

preparing the walls 

for siege  

You do understand 

Stannis Baratheon sails this way  

If my Uncle Stannis lands on 

the shores of King s Landing  

I ll ride out 

to greet him. 

A brave choice  

Your Grace. 

I m sure your men 

will line up behind you. 

They say Stannis 

never smiles. 

I ll give him 

a red smile 

from ear to ear. 

Imagine Stannis s terror. 

I am trying. 

You re 

an intelligent man. 

I d like to think 

I m an intelligent man. 

Oh  no one disputes 

that  My Lord  

not even the multitudes 

who despise you. 

I wish we could converse 

as two honest  intelligent men. 

I wish we could  too. 

What do you want  

Tell me. 

If we re going to play  

you ll have to start. 

My brother was the youngest 

Kingsguard in history. 

My sister became queen 

at the age of . 

When I reached manhood  

my father put me 

in charge of all the drains 

and cisterns in Casterly Rock. 

A most highborn plumber. 

The water never 

flowed better. 

And all the shit 

found its way to the sea. 

I never expected 

to have any real power. 

So when my father 

named me acting Hand   

You re quite good 

at being Hand  you know  

Jon Arryn and Ned Stark 

were good men  

honorable men  

but they disdained the game 

and those who played. 

  You enjoy the game. 

  I do. 

Last thing I expected. 

And you play it well. 

I d like to keep 

playing it. 

If Stannis breaches 

the gates  the game is over. 

They say he burns 

his enemies alive 

to honor 

the Lord of Light. 

The Lord of Light 

wants his enemies burned  

the Drowned God 

wants them drowned. 

Why are all the Gods 

such vicious cunts  

Where is the God 

of tits and wine  

In the Summer Isles  

they worship a fertility 

goddess with  teats. 

We should sail there 

immediately. 

This morning 

I heard a song 

all the way from Qarth 

beyond the Red Waste. 

Daenerys Targaryen lives. 

A girl at the edge of the world 

is the least of our problems. 

She has three dragons. 

But even if what 

they say is true  

it ll be years before 

they are fully grown. 

And then there will be 

nowhere to hide. 

One game at a time  

my friend. 

  Men shouting   

Jorah  

 i Careful  Khaleesi.  i  

 i Xaro owns this city  i  

 i and the warlocks have    i  

 i eyes watching for you.  i  

I found one   

a ship with 

a good captain. 

She leaves for 

Astapor tomorrow. 

  Astapor  

  We cannot stay here. 

They have my dragons. 

A mother does not flee 

without her children. 

They re not your children. 

I know they call you 

the Mother of Dragons 

and I know you love them  but you 

didn t grow them in your womb. 

They didn t suckle at your breast. 

They are dragons  Khaleesi. 

And if we stay 

in Qarth  we ll die. 

You should sail to Astapor. 

I m sure you ll be safe there. 

You know 

I would die for you. 

I will never 

abandon you. 

I m sworn to protect you  

to serve. 

Then serve me. 

If my dragons are in 

the House of the Undying  

then take me there. 

That s what 

the warlock wants. 

He told you so himself. 

If you enter that place  

you will never leave again. 

  His magic is strong. 

  And what of my magic  

You saw me step 

into the fire. 

You watched the witch burn. 

What did the flames do to me  

Do you remember  

Until my last breath 

I will remember. 

After I have forgotten 

my mother s face. 

They are my children. 

And they are the only 

children I will ever have. 

Take me to them. 

We should bury them. 

I d leave  em up 

a few more days. 

Sends a message. 

If they haven t got 

the damn message yet  

a few more days 

won t help. 

As you say. 

But it don t hurt to let 

 em rot a while longer. 

What s this  

Gold for the farmer. 

For his trouble. 

His troubles are done. 

He s feeding 

the crops now. 

 i His wife  too.  i  

You want to keep a man 

silent  you silence him. 

Got as far as the farm 

and then doubled back. 

Walked through the stream 

to throw off the hounds. 

Hoped this would be the 

last place they d think to look. 

You re right... 

so far. 

Who was that out there 

hung up the gates  

Must have been 

the farmer s boys. 

He killed them 

and burned them 

 i and passed them off  i  

 i as the little lords   i  

Shh  shh  shh. 

 i They mustn t know.  i  

 i Bran would blame  i  

 i himself.  i  

Osha   i They ll never  i  

 i hear it from me.  i  

 i The little lads  i  

 i have suffered enough.  i  

  Both yelling   

  Applause  cheering   

Well struck. 

Well struck  Dog. 

Did you like that  

It was well struck  

Your Grace. 

I already said 

it was well struck. 

Yes  Your Grace. 

  Who s next  

  Herald   i Lothor Brune   i  

freerider in the service 

of Lord Baelish. 

Ser Dontos the Red 

of House Hollard. 

Ser Dontos the Red 

of House Hollard  

Dontos  

 i Here I am.  i  

Here I am. 

Sorry  Your Grace. 

My deepest apologies. 

  Joffrey   i Are you drunk   i  

  No. 

Uh  no. 

No  Your Grace. 

  I had two cups of wine. 

  Two cups  

That s not much at all. 

Please  

have another cup. 

Are you sure  Your Grace  

Joffrey   i Yes. To celebrate  i  

 i my name day.  i  

Have two. 

Have as much as you like. 

I would be honored  

Your Grace. 

Ser Meryn  help Ser Dontos 

celebrate my name day. 

See that he drinks 

his fill. 

 i   Crowd gasps    i  

  Gurgling   

You can t. 

What did you say  

Did you say I can t  

I only meant 

it would be bad luck 

to kill a man 

on your name day. 

What kind of stupid 

peasant s superstition... 

Hound  

 i The girl is right.  i  

 i What a man sows  i  

 i on his name day  i  

he reaps all year. 

   i   Men laughing    i  

   i   Wine pouring    i  

   i   Dontos gagging    i  

  Take him away. 

I ll have him killed 

tomorrow  the fool. 

 i   Crowd murmuring    i  

He is. 

A fool   

you re so clever to see it. 

He ll make a much better fool 

than a knight. 

He doesn t deserve 

the mercy of a quick death. 

Did you hear My Lady  

Ser Dontos  

From this day  

you ll be my new fool. 

Thank you  Your Grace. 

And you  My Lady  

thank you. 

Tyrion  

 i Beloved nephew.  i  

We looked for you 

on the battlefield. 

You were nowhere 

to be found. 

I ve been here  

ruling the kingdoms. 

What a fine job 

you ve done. 

Look at you. 

More beautiful 

than ever. 

And you  You   you re going to be 

bigger than the hound  

  but much better looking. 

    Laughs   

This one doesn t like me. 

Can t imagine why. 

  We heard you were dead. 

  I m glad you re not dead. 

Me  too  dear. 

Death is so boring  

especially now 

with so much excitement 

in the world. 

My Lady  I m sorry 

for your loss. 

Her loss  

Her father was 

a confessed traitor. 

But still her father. 

Surely having so recently 

lost your own beloved father 

you can sympathize. 

My father was a traitor. 

My mother and brother 

are traitors  too. 

I am loyal 

to my beloved Joffrey. 

Of course you are. 

Well  enjoy your name day  

Your Grace. 

Wish I could stay 

and celebrate  

but there is work 

to be done. 

What work  

Why are you here  

Pycelle  The raven arrived 

from the Citadel 

  this morning  Your Grace. 

   Bird squawking   

The conclave has met  

considered reports 

from Maesters all over 

the Seven Kingdoms  

 i and declared  i  

 i this great summer  i  

done at last. 

The longest summer 

in living memory. 

The peasants say  

a long summer means 

   i an even longer winter.  i  

  Pycelle   i A common superstition.  i  

Littlefinger   i We have enough wheat  i  

 i for a five year winter.  i  

If it lasts any longer  

we ll have 

fewer peasants. 

The city s drowning in refugees  

Your Grace  fleeing the war. 

We have nowhere 

to house them. 

And with winter coming  

it ll only get worse. 

You command the City Watch  

do you not  Lord Slynt  

 i I do  Your Grace.  i  

And are you not 

a Lord at my command  

I owe my title and lands 

to your generosity  Your Grace. 

Then do your job. 

Shut the gates to the peasants. 

They belong in the field  

not our capital. 

  Yes  Your Grace. 

   i   Man whistling tune    i  

Don t get up. 

More ravishing than ever  

big sister. 

War agrees with you. 

Forgive the interruption. 

Carry on. 

What are you doing here  

Ah  it s been 

a remarkable journey. 

I pissed off the edge 

of the Wall  

 i I slept in a sky cell   i  

I fought with 

the hill tribes   

so many adventures  

so much to be 

thankful for. 

What are you doing here  

This is the small council. 

Yes. well I  do believe  

the Hand of the King  

is welcome at all 

small council meetings. 

Our father 

is Hand of the King. 

Yes  but in his absence... 

Varys   i Your father has named  i  

 i Lord Tyrion  i  

to serve as Hand 

in his stead while he fights. 

Out  All of you out  

Cersei  I would like to know 

how you tricked father into this. 

Tyrion  If I were capable 

of tricking father  

I d be emperor 

of the world by now. 

You brought this 

on yourself. 

I ve done nothing. 

Quite right   

you did nothing 

when your son called 

for Ned Stark s head. 

Now the entire North 

has risen up against us. 

  I tried to stop it. 

  Did you  You failed. 

That bit of theater will haunt 

our family for a generation. 

  Robb Stark is a child. 

  Who s won every battle he s fought. 

Do you understand 

we re losing the war  

  What do you know about warfare  

  Nothing. 

But I know people. 

And I know that our enemies hate 

each other 

almost as much 

as they hate us. 

  Joffrey is King. 

  Joffrey is King. 

You are here 

to advise him. 

I m only here 

to advise him. 

And if the King listens 

to what I say  

the King might just get 

his Uncle Jaime back. 

How  

You love your children. 

It s your one 

redeeming quality. 

That and your cheekbones. 

The Starks love 

their children as well. 

  And we have two of them. 

  One. 

  One  

  Arya  little animal   she disappeared. 

Disappeared  

What  in a puff of smoke  

We had three Starks 

to trade. 

You chopped one s head off 

and let another escape. 

Father will be furious. 

It must be odd for you... 

to be the disappointing child. 

 i   Crow cawing    i  

Leadranach   i My Lord  may the Old Gods  i  

 i watch over your brother  i  

 i and all our northern sons.  i  

 i The walls of my Holdfast  i  

 i will not stand the winter.  i  

The stones were last mortared 

in the time of King Aerys  

and I m afraid 

the masons today 

are not fit to carry 

their fathers  hammers. 

When I was a boy  

I remember seeing them 

 i put up a new tower  i  

 i at Torrhen s Square in a summer.  i  

 i Men worked back then.  i  

Today  my Holdfast 

looks like it was built 

by drunk children. 

At night you can hear the wind 

howling through the gaps. 

 i And the Gods  i  

 i forbid it rains.  i  

Why  I might as well sleep 

beneath a waterfall. 

Luwin  

 i Maintenance of a Holdfast  i  

generally falls 

to the lord of that Holdfast. 

Generally  yes  

but I ve sent 

all the young men off 

to fight 

Robb Stark s war. 

King Robb. 

And it s not his war. 

He didn t choose it. 

Maybe not  My Lord  

but he called in his Banners 

and took the men. 

Bran  

 i Joffrey killed my father   i  

your liege lord. 

Do you remember 

your vows  Ser  

Of course I remember  

We can spare four masons 

for a week  My Lord. 

Will that be sufficient 

to repair your walls  

I   I believe it will. 

We didn t want him here 

all day  did we  

I didn t like the way 

he was talking about Robb. 

Nor did I. 

But listening to people 

you d rather not listen to 

is one of your responsibilities 

as Lord of Winterfell. 

  Sighs   

Luwin  

 i Lord Portan.  i  

 i My Lord  may the Old Gods  i  

 i watch over your brother  i  

 i and all our northern sons.  i  

 i   Heavy breathing    i  

   i   Wings flapping    i  

   i   Bird squawking    i  

Boil this for an hour 

and drink the tea. 

Makes all your pain 

go away. 

Bran  

Don t have any pain. 

Lucky for you. 

That way. 

You ve been having 

those dreams again. 

Bran  

 i I don t dream.  i  

Everyone dreams. 

I don t. 

Heard some of the men 

talking about the comet. 

 i They say it s an omen.  i  

They say it means Robb will win 

a great victory in the South. 

Did they  

Osha  I heard some other fools 

say it s Lannister Red. 

Means the Lannisters will rule 

all Seven Kingdoms before long. 

Heard a stableboy say 

it s the color of blood 

to mark the death 

of your father. 

The stars 

don t fall for men. 

The red comet means 

one thing  boy   

dragons. 

The dragons are all dead. 

They ve been dead 

for centuries. 

  Shrieks   

Mmm. 

Mmm. Mmm. 

What did your brother say 

about them  Khaleesi  

He said they ate meat. 

He didn t tell you 

what kind of meat  

My brother didn t know 

anything about dragons. 

He didn t know anything 

about anything. 

Eh. 

  Whinnies   

 i   Women murmuring    i  

She was Drogo s 

first gift to me. 

I remember. 

I promised 

to protect them. 

Promised them their enemies 

would die screaming. 

How do I make 

starvation scream  

A trick I never learned  

I m afraid. 

Does it ever end  

This is farther east 

than I ve ever been. 

But  yes  Khaleesi  

everything ends  

even the red waste. 

And you re sure 

there s no other way  

If we go south to the land 

of the Lazarheen  

the Lamb Men will kill us 

and take your dragons. 

If we go west 

to the Dothraki Sea  

the first 

Khalasar we meet 

will kill us 

and take your dragons. 

No one will take 

my dragons. 

They are too weak to fight  

as are your people. 

You must be 

their strength. 

As you are mine. 

  Speaks Dothraki   

  Speaking Dothraki   

  Speaks Dothraki   

Rakharo... 

You never have. 

This is bad time to start. 

 i   Horse whinnies    i  

 i   Wind howling    i  

 i   Thunder rumbling    i  

 i   Bird caws    i  

Having a rough time of it  

Nothing s killed me yet. 

  Grenn  Your ass killed the sledge. 

  You offered me a ride. 

I just wanted you to shut up about 

your damn blisters. 

I was born in a place 

like this. 

Later  I fell 

on hard times. 

Samwell  

 i Are those girls   i  

Dolorous Edd  

 i Craster s daughters.  i  

I haven t seen a girl 

in six months. 

I d keep on not seeing them 

if I were you. 

What  he don t like people messing 

with his daughters  

He don t like people 

messing with his wives. 

He marries 

his daughters  

 i and they give him  i  

 i more daughters.  i  

And on and on it goes. 

  That s foul. 

  It s beyond foul. 

All the other wildlings for a 

hundred leagues have disappeared. 

Craster s still here. 

He must be doing 

something right. 

What happens 

to the boys  

  Hmm  

   i He marries his daughters.  i  

What does he do 

with his sons  

He said he planned 

to stop here 

on his way 

to the Frostfangs. 

People make 

all sorts of plans. 

I haven t seen Benjen Stark 

in three years. 

Haven t missed him. 

Always treated me 

like scum. 

Haven t had any good wine 

for a long time. 

You Southerners make good wine  

I ll give you that. 

We re not Southerners. 

Who s this little girl  

You re prettier 

than half my daughters. 

You got a nice wet twat 

between your legs  

What s your name  

  Jon Snow. 

  Snow  eh  

Listen to me  bastard. 

All you lot from south of the Wall  

you re Southerners. 

But now you re in the North  

the real North. 

The lad meant no harm. 

I catch that pretty little bastard 

talking to my daughters   

No one will talk to your daughters  

you have my word. 

Now  sit down 

and shut your mouth. 

You bring any of that 

good wine with you  

We did. 

We passed through 

six villages on the way here. 

All six were abandoned. 

Where have all 

the wildlings gone  

I could tell you  

but I m thirsty. 

Mormont   i There s a barrel of  i  

 i Dornish wine on the sledge.  i  

   i Bring it in here.  i  

  Man   i Yes  commander.  i  

Craster   i You want to know  i  

 i where they ve all gone   i  

 i North... to join up  i  

 i with Mance Rayder...  i  

Your old friend. 

He s no friend of mine. 

He broke his vows  

betrayed his brothers. 

Oh  aye. 

But once he was 

just a poor black crow. 

And now he s 

King Beyond the Wall. 

He s been calling 

himself that for years. 

What s he king of  

A frozen lake somewhere  

That s a good looking axe. 

 i Fresh forged   i  

Give it here. 

You ll have another one 

made at Castle Black. 

Here. 

Oh  that s some 

lovely steel. 

You want to know 

what Mance Rayder is doing  

Gathering an army. 

 i What I hear   i  

 i he s already got more men  i  

 i than any of your  i  

 i southern kings.  i  

And where does he plan 

marching this army  

When you re 

all the way north  

there s only 

one direction to go. 

These are bad times to be 

living alone in the wild. 

The cold winds 

are rising. 

Let them come. 

My roots are sunk deep. 

Wife... 

tell the Lord Crow 

how content we are. 

This is our place. 

Our husband keeps us safe. 

Better to live free 

than die a slave. 

Craster   i Don t it make you  i  

 i jealous  old man   i  

to see me with 

all these young wives 

and you with no one 

to warm your bed  

We chose different paths. 

Oh  aye  and you chose the path 

with no one but boys on it. 

You ll be wanting to sleep 

beneath my roof  I suppose  

and eat me out of pigs. 

A roof would be welcome. 

It s been hard riding. 

We ve brought our own food 

and good steel for you. 

Any man lays a hand 

on one of my wives  

he loses the hand. 

And I see this one 

staring too long  

I might just gouge 

his eyes out. 

Your roof  your rules. 

  Grunts   

Who am I   

  Who am I   

  Lord commander. 

  And who are you  

  Jon Snow. 

Who  i are  i  you  

Your steward. 

You want to lead 

one day  

Then learn 

how to follow. 

 i   Man panting    i  

Melisandre   i Lord of Light  come to us  i  

 i in our darkness.  i  

We offer you 

these false Gods. 

Take them and cast 

your light upon us... 

For the night is dark 

and full of terrors. 

Men  For the night is dark 

and full of terrors. 

Melisandre  

 i After the long summer   i  

 i darkness will fall heavy  i  

 i on the world.  i  

The stars will bleed. 

We need to stop her. 

Melisandre   i The cold breath of winter  i  

 i will freeze the seas...  i  

Not now. 

 i ...And the dead shall rise  i  

 i in the North.  i  

All you men were named 

in the Light of the Seven  

 i Is this how you treat  i  

 i the Gods of your fathers   i  

Are you so eager to spit 

on your ancestors  

You smell of fear   

fear and piss 

and old bones. 

Do you want to stop me  

Stop me. 

In the ancient books  

it s written 

that a warrior will draw 

a burning sword from the fire. 

And that sword shall be 

Lightbringer. 

Stannis Baratheon  

warrior of light  

your sword awaits you. 

 i   Men cheering    i  

Men  Lord  cast your 

light upon us  

Melisandre   i For the night is dark  i  

 i and full of terrors.  i  

For the night is dark 

and full of terror. 

This woman will lead him 

into a war he cannot win. 

Stannis is our king. 

We follow 

where he leads  

  even if we don t like the path. 

  King. 

Since that boar 

killed his brother  

every lord wants 

a coronation. 

I don t serve the others. 

I serve Stannis. 

As do I  

but loyal service 

means telling 

hard truths. 

He s surrounded 

by fools and fanatics  

but he trusts you  Davos. 

If you tell him 

the truth... 

What s the truth  

Matthos   i  And I declare upon  i  

 i the honor of my house  i  

 i that my beloved  i  

 i brother Robert     i  

he wasn t 

my beloved brother. 

I didn t love him. 

He didn t love me. 

A harmless courtesy  

Your Grace. 

A lie. 

Take it out. 

 ...that my brother Robert 

left no trueborn heirs  

the boy Joffrey  

the boy Tommen  

and the girl Myrcella 

being born of incest 

 i between Cersei Lannister and  i  

 i her brother Jaime Lannister.  i  

   i By right of birth     i  

  Jaime Lannister  the Kingslayer. 

Call him what he is. 

Matthos   i  ...And her brother  i  

 i Jaime Lannister   i  

 i the Kingslayer.  i  

 i By right of birth and blood   i  

 i i do this day lay claim     i  

Stannis   i Make it  i  Ser  i Jaime Lannister   i  

 i the Kingslayer.  i  

Whatever else he is  

the man s still a knight. 

 Ser Jaime Lannister  

the Kingslayer. 

By right of birth 

and blood  

 i I do this day lay claim  i  

 i to the Iron Throne of Westeros.  i  

Let all true men 

declare their loyalty.  

When Eddard Stark learned 

the truth  he told only me. 

I ll not make 

the same mistake. 

Send copies of that letter 

to every corner of the Realm  

from the Arbor 

to the Wall. 

The time has come 

to choose. 

Let no man claim ignorance 

as an excuse. 

Your Grace the Lannisters 

are the true enemy. 

If  for the time being  you could 

make peace with your brother   

I ll not make peace with Renly 

while he calls himself King. 

Well  many have already 

declared for him   

Mace Tyrell  

Randyll Tarly. 

Stannis does not need to beg 

this lord or that lord for support. 

 i The Lord of Light  i  

 i stands behind him.  i  

And how many ships has 

the Lord of Light got in his fleet  

  He has no need for ships. 

  I m sure he doesn t  

but we do if we re 

going to war. 

If not Renly  Your Grace  

join forces with Robb Stark. 

Who would steal 

the northern half of my kingdom. 

I ve always served thieves 

according to their desserts  

 i as you well know   i  

 i Ser Davos.  i  

Joffrey  Renly  Robb Stark  

they re all thieves. 

They ll bend the knee 

or I ll destroy them. 

I owe you 

an apology  my King. 

My duty is to serve. 

 i You have chosen the new God  i  

 i over the Old Gods.  i  

 i May the Lord of Light  i  

 i watch over us all.  i  

Shall we drink together  

Don t. 

A cup of wine to honor 

the one true God. 

  Thuds   

  Men murmuring   

The night is dark and full 

of terrors  old man  

but the fire 

burns them all away. 

  Chatter   

Man  

Your Grace. 

King in the North. 

I keep expecting you 

to leave me 

in one castle or another 

for safekeeping  

but you drag me along 

from camp to camp. 

Have you grown 

fond of me  Stark  

Is that it  

I ve never seen you 

with a girl. 

If I left you with 

one of my bannermen  

your father would know 

within a fortnight 

and my bannerman would receive 

a raven with a message  

 Release my son and you ll be rich 

beyond your dreams. 

Refuse and your house 

will be destroyed  root and stem.  

You don t trust 

the loyalty 

of the men following 

you into battle  

Oh  I trust them 

with my life  

just not with yours. 

Smart boy. 

What s wrong  

 i Don t like  i  

 i being called  boy    i  

Insulted  

 i   Direwolf snarling    i  

Robb   i You insult yourself   i  

 i Kingslayer.  i  

   i You ve been defeated by a boy.  i  

   i   Heavy breathing    i  

 i You re held captive  i  

 i by a boy.  i  

 i Perhaps you ll be  i  

 i killed by a boy.  i  

Stannis Baratheon 

sent ravens 

to all the high lords 

of Westeros. 

King Joffrey Baratheon 

is neither a true king 

 i nor a true Baratheon.  i  

He s your bastard son. 

 i If that s true   i  

 i Stannis is the rightful king.  i  

How convenient for him. 

My father learned 

the truth. 

That s why 

you had him executed. 

I was your prisoner 

when Ned Stark lost his head. 

Your son killed him 

so the world wouldn t 

learn who fathered him. 

And you   you pushed 

my brother from a window 

because he saw you 

with the queen. 

  Snarling   

You have proof  

Or do you want to trade gossip 

like a couple of fishwives  

I m sending one of your cousins 

down to King s Landing 

with my peace terms. 

You think my father s going 

to negotiate with you  

You don t know him 

very well. 

No  but he s starting 

to know me. 

 i Three victories  i  

 i don t make you a conqueror.  i  

It s better than 

three defeats. 

  Snarling   

Shae  

 i This city stinks...  i  

  Sniffs   

Like dead bodies. 

Tyrion  

 i A bit corpsey  yes.  i  

And shit. 

I thought you wanted 

to come here. 

I love it. 

You love the smell 

of dead bodies and shit  

And cum and garlic 

and rum. 

You can smell cum 

from the balcony  

I love the stink. 

I love the noise. 

Cities make me 

want to fuck. 

And so did the country. 

  Sighs   

This is where I belong. 

Yes  well  you need 

to be careful. 

No one can know 

you re here. 

No one will know. 

You can t trust anyone 

in King s Landing. 

 i They re all liars    i  

 i good liars  bad liars   i  

one or two great liars. 

What about you  

Me  I m not from here. 

I m a slave to the truth. 

  Laughs   

Truth  

  Laughs   

You are the biggest 

little liar I have ever met. 

Why do you think 

I am so little  

I m being crushed beneath the 

weight of all that truth. 

Oh  

Ned Stark actually 

slept on this. 

As if the poor man 

didn t suffer enough. 

One of the many changes 

we ll have to make around here. 

  Lord Baelish. 

  Your Grace. 

I wonder if I might 

ask you for a favor. 

Of course  

Your Grace. 

Ned Stark s youngest 

daughter Arya   

we can t seem 

to locate her. 

If she s escaped 

the capital  

Winterfell seems 

the logical destination. 

And yet my friends in the North 

report no sign of her. 

Curious. 

If we choose to negotiate 

with the Starks  

the girl has some value. 

Whoever finds her   

well  you know what they say about 

Lannisters and debts. 

Well  you could ask 

Varys where she is. 

He ll have 

an answer for you. 

Whether you believe it... 

Myself  I have always had 

a hard time trusting eunuchs. 

  Who knows what they want  

    Chuckles   

A mockingbird. 

You created your 

own Sigil  didn t you  

Yes. 

Appropriate... 

for a self made man 

with so many 

songs to sing. 

I m glad you like it. 

Some people are 

fortunate enough 

to be born into 

the right family. 

Others have to find 

their own way. 

I heard a song once 

about a boy 

of modest means 

who found his way into the 

home of a very prominent family. 

He loved 

the eldest daughter. 

Sadly  she had eyes 

for another. 

When boys and girls 

live in the same home  

awkward situations 

can arise. 

Sometimes  I ve heard  

even brothers and sisters 

develop 

certain affections. 

And when these affections 

become common knowledge  

well  that is an awkward 

situation indeed  

especially 

in a prominent family. 

But prominent families 

often forget a simple truth  

I ve found. 

And which truth is that  

Knowledge is power. 

Seize him. 

Cut his throat. 

Stop. Wait. 

I ve changed my mind. 

Let him go. 

Step back three paces. 

Turn around. 

Close your eyes. 

Power is power. 

Do see if you can 

take some time away from 

your coins and your whores 

to locate 

the Stark girl for me. 

I would very much 

appreciate it. 

Robb  

 i You re Ser Alton Lannister   i  

I am  Your Grace. 

 i I offer your cousins peace  i  

 i if they meet my terms.  i  

First  your family 

must release my sisters. 

Second  my father s bones 

must be returned to us 

so he may rest beside 

his brother and sister 

in the crypts 

beneath Winterfell. 

And the remains of all those 

who died in his service 

must also be returned. 

Their families can honor 

them with proper funerals. 

  An honorable request  Your Grace. 

   i Third...  i  

Joffrey and the Queen Regent 

must renounce all claim 

to dominion of the North. 

From this time 

till the end of time  

we are a free 

and independent kingdom. 

The King in the North. 

All  

King in the North. 

Neither Joffrey 

nor any of his men 

shall set foot 

in our lands again. 

If he disregards 

this command  

he shall suffer 

the same fate as my father  

only I don t need a servant 

to do my beheading for me. 

These are   Your Grace  

these are   

these are my terms. 

If the Queen Regent and her son 

meet them  I ll give them peace. 

If not... 

I will litter the south 

with Lannister dead. 

King Joffrey is a Baratheon  

Your Grace. 

Oh  is he  

You ll ride at daybreak  

Ser Alton. 

That will be all 

for tonight. 

A word  Your Grace  

You don t have to call me 

 Your Grace  when no one s around. 

It s not so bad 

once you get used to it. 

I m glad someone s 

gotten used to it. 

The Lannisters are going to reject 

your terms  you know  

Of course they are. 

We can fight them 

in the fields as long as you like  

but we won t beat them until you 

take King s Landing. 

And we can t take 

King s Landing without ships. 

My father has ships and men 

who know how to sail them. 

Men who fought 

my father. 

Men who fought King Robert 

to free themselves 

from the yoke of the South  

just like you re doing now. 

I m his only living son. 

He ll listen to me. 

I know he will. 

I m not a Stark. 

I know that. 

But your father raised me 

to be an honorable man. 

We can avenge him 

together. 

You don t want 

Balon Greyjoy for an ally. 

I need his ships. 

They say he has . 

They say a million rats 

live in the sewers of King s Landing. 

Shall we rally them 

to fight for us  

I understand you don t 

trust Lord Greyjoy. 

I don t trust Lord Greyjoy because 

he is not trustworthy. 

Your father had to go to war 

to end his rebellion. 

Yes. And now I m the one 

rebelling against the throne. 

Before me  it was father. 

You married one rebel 

and mothered another. 

I mothered more than 

just rebels  

a fact you seem 

to have forgotten. 

If I trade the Kingslayer 

for two girls  

my bannermen will string me up 

by my feet. 

You want to leave Sansa 

in the Queen s hands  

 i And Arya    i  

I haven t heard 

a word about Arya. 

What are we fighting for 

if not for them  

It s more complicated 

than that  

You know it is. 

It s time for me 

to go home. 

I haven t seen Bran 

or Rickon in months. 

You can t go 

to Winterfell. 

I beg your pardon  

I ll send Rodrik 

to watch over the boys 

because tomorrow 

you ll ride south to the Stormlands. 

Why in the name 

of all the Gods   

because I need you to negotiate 

with Renly Baratheon. 

He s rallied 

an army of  . 

You know him. 

You know his family. 

I haven t seen Renly Baratheon 

since he was a boy. 

 i You have a hundred  i  

 i other lords    i  

Which of these lords 

do I trust more than you  

If Renly sides with us  

we ll outnumber them 

two to one. 

When they feel the jaws beginning 

to shut  they ll sue for peace. 

We ll get the girls back. 

Then we ll all 

go home... for good. 

  Sighs   

I will ride at first light. 

We will all be together 

again soon  I promise. 

You ve done so well. 

Your father 

would be... proud. 

  Give Lord Renly my regards. 

   i King  i  Renly. 

There s a king 

in every corner now. 

  Hammering   

What is all this  

Returning this room 

to its proper appearance. 

Say what you will about the Targaryens   

they were conquerors. 

That is a seat 

for a conqueror. 

It needs a room to match it  

not vines and flowers. 

We can t find Arya Stark. 

With luck  she s dead 

in a ditch somewhere. 

Perhaps. But if not  

we need her. 

They ll never give Jaime back 

to us for Sansa alone. 

I think they might. 

They re weak. 

They put too much value 

on their women. 

We need to set our armies 

to the task of finding her. 

Send out as many men 

as we can. 

I m sure if you asked 

grandfather   

The King does not ask  

He commands. 

And my grandfather s 

stupidity in the field of battle 

is the reason Robb Stark has 

Uncle Jaime in the first place. 

His life is in danger. 

We re at war. 

All our lives 

are in danger. 

I heard a disgusting lie 

about Uncle Jaime. 

And you. 

Our enemies 

will say anything 

to weaken your claim 

to the throne. 

It s not a claim. 

The throne is mine. 

Of course it is. 

No one believes 

this foul gossip. 

Someone believes it. 

Father had 

other children  

Besides me and Tommen 

and Myrcella  

What are you asking  

I m asking if he fucked 

other women 

when he grew tired 

of you. 

How many bastards 

does he have running   

  silence   

  Work resumes   

What you just did 

is punishable by death. 

You will never 

do it again. 

Never. 

That will be all  

Mother. 

  Loud moaning   

No  no  no  no. 

Do you have any idea 

how ridiculous you sound  

Ease into it. 

Slowly  with passion. 

  Moaning   

Oh  yeah. 

  Sighs   Go wash yourselves. 

Put some clothes on. 

Both of you 

are working tonight. 

We do things 

differently here  Daisy. 

This isn t some five copper 

bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

Don t call him 

Littlefinger. 

He doesn t like it.

  Valar morghulis. 

  Valar dohaeris. 

I ve been sweeping this floor for days. 

  Good. 

  I didn t come here to sweep floors. 

No  Why come than  

You said that I could be your apprentice. 

You said you d teach me 

how to a Faceless Man. 

A man teaches a girl. 

Valar dohaeris. 

All men must serve. 

Faceless men  most of all. 

I want to serve. 

A girl wants to serve herself. 

Here we serve the Many Faced God  

to serve well. 

  A girl must become no one. 

  Which one is the Many Faced God  

I see the Stranger  I see the Drowned God  

  I see the Weirwood Face. 

  There is only one god. 

A girl knows his name. 

And no man know his gift. 

Where are they taking him  

Queen Margaery  

Queen Margaery  

Queen Margaery  

  I m his  and he s mine. 

  I m hers  and she s mine. 

  From this day until the end of my days. 

  From this day until the end of my days. 

  Did I hurt you  

  No. You were lovely. 

  It all happened so fast. 

  Yes. 

I was scared maybe I hurt you  

it sounded like... 

No  no  no... 

you re very sweet. 

The sweetest king who ever lived. 

This is what I want to do all day  

every day for the rest of my life. 

Wouldn t that be glorious  

Shouldn t we rest a little while  

Just to catch our breath  

there s no rush  is there  

Of course not. 

Are you hungry  

Shall I have them bring you some cake 

or pomegranate juice...  

No  I m fine... 

I just want you all to myself. 

I want to know everything there is to know 

about King Tommen First of His Name. 

King Tommen... 

it still sounds strange to me. 

Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you  

  So strange. Husband. 

  Wife. 

Sometimes it feels odd. 

I m the king  I ve married 

the most beautiful woman in the world  

and it s all because my brother died. 

I understand. 

But it s no your fault  

you know that  don t you  

You mustn t feel guilty. 

I don t feel guilty. 

That s what s odd. 

Do you like to sail  

  I love to sail. 

  I do  too. 

I think we re going to be very happy  

you and I. 

I do  too. 

Living in a tower so high  

it touches the clouds. 

Of course my grandmother 

couldn t wait to go home. 

The capital is not for everyone  I suppose. 

Does your mother like it here  

I don t think so. 

She told me never to trust anyone 

in King s Landing. 

It s so wonderful to have her 

watching over you. 

A lioness guiding her cub. 

Well  but I m a man now. 

You are. 

And the king. 

But you ll always be her baby boy. 

I suppose. 

I adore how she has always been 

so generous with me  so kind. 

And the horror she s had to endure. 

Losing her husband  

her eldest child and her father. 

It s no wonder she s so protective of you. 

She ll never let you out of her sight. 

You re very much in love. 

The first days of marriage 

are often so blissful. 

She s certainly very pretty  isn t she  

Like a doll  she smiles quite a lot. 

Do you think she s intelligent  

I can t quite tell. 

  Not that it matters. 

  Do you ever miss Casterly Rock  

There s nothing for me in Casterly Rock. 

That s where you grew up. 

You always told me 

that you liked the people there better. 

You said that King s Landing 

smelled of horse dung and sour milk. 

  Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock  

  The way that you talked about it... 

I always thought that you missed it. 

  That you... That it was your real home. 

  This is my real home now. 

Where my family lives. 

I want you to be happy  mother. 

I know that. 

  I know you do  my sweet boy. 

  But wouldn t you be happier in Casterly Rock  

I said   Darling  surely  times is enough  

are you trying to set a new record   

And he said   Well  what is the record  

I m sure we can break it.  

Mother. 

Welcome. 

Well don t you look lovely. 

Marriage agrees with you. 

Can we bring you anything to eat or drink  

I wish we had some wine for you. 

It s a bit early in the day for us. 

No  no  I...I can t stay. 

I just wanted to let you know if... 

there is ever anything I can do for you. 

You are very sweet. 

Tommen seems quite taken 

with his new queen. 

I absolutely adore him. 

You raised a gallant young man. 

  I m forever grateful. 

  Good. 

Good. 

I m glad to hear you re happy. 

Ecstatic. I really am. 

Exhausted  to be honest  but 

what can I expect  he is 

half lion  half stag. 

I ll leave you to it then. 

Oh  forgive me  I haven t been at 

Court for long  I get so confused. 

What s the proper way to address you now  

Queen Mother or Dowager Queen  

There s no need for such formalities. 

In any event  judging from 

the King s enthusiasm  

the Queen Mother will be a 

Queen Grandmother soon. 

That ll be a lovely day. 

Imagine the celebrations. 

They ll ring the bells all day and night. 

Remember. 

Anything you need. 

We can t hold the North with terror alone. 

You can t hold the North if you 

let these lesser lords insult us. 

I sent you there to collect 

taxes  not bodies. 

Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. 

He said the Warden of the 

North will always be a Stark  

and he d be damned if he 

kissed a traitor s boot. 

You left him no choice. 

I flayed him living  

along with his wife and brother. 

I made his son watch. 

And  

The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes. 

I have something important to tell you. 

Stop eating and listen. 

We don t have enough men to hold the North 

if the other Houses rise up against us. 

Do you understand that  

Our pact with the Lannisters... 

I had a pact with Tywin Lannister. 

Tywin Lannister is dead. 

The remaining Lannisters are a thousand 

miles away dealing with that fact. 

They ve never once in the 

history of the Seven Kingdoms 

sent their army this far north. 

If you think they will for us  

you re a fool. 

We become a great House by entering 

in alliances with other Houses  

and parleying those alliances 

into greater power. 

Now the best way to forge 

a lasting alliance 

isn t by peeling a man s skin off  

the best way is marriage. 

Now that you re a Bolton by royal decree  

it s time you married a suitable bride. 

And as it happens  

I found the perfect girl to 

solidify our hold in the North. 

  That s Moat Cailin. 

  Yes. 

A bit shabby  isn t it  

You ve been here before. 

On our way down to King s Landing  

with my father and Arya and... 

  Where are you taking me  

  Home. 

The Boltons have Winterfell. 

The marriage proposal...It wasn t for you  

No. 

Roose Bolton murdered my brother. 

He betrayed my family  

He did. 

He serves the Lannisters. 

  For now. 

  I won t go. 

  Winterfell is your home. 

  Not anymore. 

Always. You re a Stark. 

Dyeing your hair doesn t change that. 

You re Sansa Stark. 

The eldest surviving child 

of Ned and Catelyn Stark. 

Your place is in the North. 

I can t marry him. 

You can t make me. 

He s a traitor. 

A murderer. 

You re not marrying Roose Bolton. 

No  you ll be marrying his son and heir  

Ramsay. 

  One day he ll be Warden of the North and... 

  No  

  Sansa... 

  No  you can t make me. 

I will starve myself. I will 

die before I have to go there. 

I won t force you to do anything. 

Don t you know by now how 

much I care for you  

Say the word and we turn the 

horses round  but listen to me. 

Listen. 

You ve been running all your life. 

Terrible things happened to 

your family and you weep. 

You sit alone in a dark room  

mourning their fates. 

You ve been a bystander to tragedy from 

the day they executed your father. 

Stop being a bystander  you hear me  

Stop running. 

There s no justice in the world. 

Not unless we make it. 

You loved your family. 

Avenge them. 

How do we get through there  

We don t. 

We go around. 

It sets miles out of the way. 

  We ll lose sight of them. 

  Doesn t matter. 

I know where they re going. 

Don t you get a bit old for a squire  

How did you end up squiring for the Imp  

He hates that nickname. 

Well  he s not here to 

complain about it  is he  

I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer 

during the War of the Five Kings. 

One night  

he had a bit too much to drink. 

And he was famished  so he borrowed a ham. 

  He borrowed it  

  He wasn t a thief. 

He was drunk and hungry 

and he wasn t thinking. 

I was drunk too. 

He gave me half the ham. 

Next morning  

one of the guards saw him passed out  

under a wagon  with the ham 

bone still in his hand. 

They hanged the man after noon. 

They tied the noose for me too  

but Lord Tywin heard my 

family name was Payne  

so he pardoned me  

and sent me to King s Landing 

to squire for his son. 

Punishment  

  For both of you. 

  It didn t seem that way. 

Lord Tyrion was always very good to me. 

I guess all of your lords 

were very kind to you. 

All except me. 

Sorry you have to squire 

such a nasty person. 

I m not sorry. You re the 

best fighter I ve ever seen. 

You beat The Hound. 

I m proud to be your squire. 

I m sorry I m always snapping at you. 

If you wouldn t snap at me 

I wouldn t learn anything. 

You want to be a knight  Pod  

Yes. 

Starting tomorrow  we ll train 

with the sword twice a day  

before we ride in the morning and 

after we camp for the evening. 

And I m going to show you 

how to ride properly. 

Thank you. 

I can t knight you  

but I can teach you how to fight. 

I suppose that s more important. 

You weren t a knight  but 

you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon  

weren t you  

I was. 

Lord Tyrion said he was a good man. 

He was. 

But how did you end up serving Renly  

When I was a girl  

my father held a ball. 

I m his only living child  so he wants 

to make a good match for me. 

He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. 

I didn t want to go  but he dragged me 

to the ballroom. 

And it was wonderful. 

None of the boys noticed 

how mulish and tall I was. 

The shaft each other and threatened to duel 

if they thought it was their turn to dance. 

Whispered in my ear 

how they wanted to marry me and take me 

back to their castles. 

My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. 

I d never been so happy. 

Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. 

And then they all started to laugh  they 

couldn t keep the game going any longer. 

They were toying with me. 

Brienne the Beauty  they called me. 

Great joke. 

And I realized I was the 

ugliest girl alive. 

A great lumbering beast. 

I tried to run away  but Renly Baratheon 

took me in his arms. 

Don t let them see your tears  he told me. 

The nasty little shits  

nasty little shits aren t worth 

crying over. 

He danced with me and none of the 

other boys could say a word. 

And he was the king s brother after all. 

But...wasn t he... 

Lord Tyrion said he was... 

Yes  Pod  he liked men  

I m not an idiot. 

He didn t love me  he didn t want me  

he danced with me because he was kind 

and he wouldn t see me hurt. 

He saved me from being a joke. 

From that day 

until his last day. 

And I couldn t save him in return. 

Nothing s more hateful than failing 

to protect the one you love. 

One day  I will avenge King Renly. 

But you said a shadow murdered him. 

How do you fight a shadow  

A shadow with the face 

of Stannis Baratheon. 

I know it was Stannis. 

I know it in my heart. 

Stannis is a man  not a shadow. 

And a man... 

can be killed. 

  Lord Commander. 

  Your Grace. 

I d like to speak alone. 

Ollie is my steward now  as I was 

Lord Commander Mormont s. 

I want him to attend my meetings  

to learn from men with experience. 

One day  he might command. 

Very well. Have you considered my offer  

I have. 

And I thank you for it. 

You do me great honor. 

All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. 

Say the word and you will be. 

But I have to refuse you. 

I m Lord Commander of the Night s Watch. 

My place is here. 

I m giving you a chance 

to avenge your family. 

Take back the castle where you grew up. 

To rule the North. 

I wish I could fight beside you. 

Believe me  I do. 

But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. 

I pledged my life to the Night s Watch. 

You re as stubborn as your father. 

And as honorable. 

I can imagine no higher praise. 

I didn t mean it as praise. 

Honor got your father killed. 

But if your mind is made up  

I won t try to persuade you. 

Can I ask Your Grace 

how long you plan to stay 

at Castle Black  

Are you bored of us already  

You saved us from Mance Rayder s army. 

We will never forget that. 

But it s a question of survival. 

Night s Watch can t continue to feed your men 

and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. 

Mm  winter is coming. 

I know it. 

We march on Winterfell within a fortnight. 

Before the snows trap us here. 

And the wildlings  

They d rather burn than fight for me  

so be it. 

I leave their fate to you. 

You could execute them  

that s the safest course. 

Or you could see if this Tormund fellow 

is more willing 

to compromise than Mance ever was. 

I assume the brothers of the Night s Watch 

would rather see the wildlings dead. 

Most of the brothers  yes. 

There s little love for the free folk here. 

You re Lord Commander. 

Your decision. 

You have many enemies in Castle Black. 

Have you considered sending 

Alliser Thorne elsewhere  

Give him command of Eastwach by the Sea. 

I heard it was best to 

keep your enemies close. 

Whoever said that didn t have many enemies. 

He sees something in you. 

Might not be apparent from his tone  

but it s the truth. He believes in you. 

I m sorry I disappointed him. 

The king is a complicated man. 

But he wants what s right 

for the Seven Kingdoms. 

As long as he s ruling them. 

He s the one true king. 

He has the blood right to that throne. 

I sworn to stay clear of the politics 

of the Seven Kingdoms. 

Have you now  

How does the Night s Watch vow go again  

I bet you ve got it memorized 

since you got here. 

Night gathers and now my watch begins... 

Not that bit  the bit at the end. 

I m the sword in the darkness  

the watcher on the walls  

the shield that guards the realm of men. 

  I pledge my life... 

  Okay  that s enough. 

Shield that guards the realm of men. 

That s what you swore to be. 

Now I m not a learned man  

the best way of helping the most people 

might not be sitting 

in a frozen castle at 

the edge of the world. 

It just might mean wading in the muck 

and getting your boots dirty 

and doing what needs to be done. 

And what needs to be done  

As long as the Boltons rule the North  

the North will suffer. 

Just one man s opinion. 

What do you want  

Who are you  

What  

You  who walk in here 

with a coin you never earned  

whose value you do not respect. 

Who are you  

No one. Ou  Cunt  

A lie  a sad little lie. 

  Who are you  

  I told you  I m no... 

Do that again and... 

Who are you  

You re about to find out. 

What are you doing  

We re only playing. 

The game of faces. 

That girl is not ready. 

Clearly not. 

I am ready. 

For what  

For every you want 

to be a Faceless Man. 

To be no one. 

Whose sword is that  

It belongs to Arya Stark. 

Arya Stark s sword  Arya Stark s clothes  

Arya Stark s stolen silver. 

A man wonders 

how is it that no one 

came to be surrounded 

by Arya Stark s things  

What do you do with them 

after you wash them  

Open gates  

Hold up  

Lady Sansa  welcome. 

Lord Bolton. 

May I introduce my son  Ramsay Bolton  

It s an honor to meet you. 

I ll bring you a bowl of hot water. 

You must want to wash. 

Thank you. 

Welcome home  Lady Stark. 

The North remembers. 

Sam. 

Maester Aemon  

He apologizes for not being here. 

He s not feeling well. 

Take good care of him. 

I will drink it then. 

He ll lose. 

As you all know too well  

it s long past time to 

dig a new latrine pit. 

First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided 

to appoint 

a latrine captain to 

oversee this crucial task. 

Brian. 

It seems like a good job for a ginger. 

Ser Alliser. 

You have more experience 

than any other ranger at Castle Black. 

You proved your valour many times over 

by defending the Wall 

from the wildling attack. 

I name you First Ranger. 

Lord Janos. 

I m giving you command of Greyguard. 

Greyguard is a ruin. 

Yes  the fort is in a sorry state. 

Restore it as best you can. 

First Builder Yarwyck can spare... 

I was charged with the defense of 

King s Landing 

when you were soiling 

your swaddling clothes. 

Keep your ruin. 

Alright  alright. 

Enough of that. 

You mistake me  my Lord. 

That was a command  not an offer. 

Pack your arms and armour  

say your farewells  

and ride for Greyguard. 

I will not go meekly off to freeze and die. 

Give it to one of the fools 

who cast a stone for you. 

I will not have it. 

Did you hear me  boy  

I will not have it  

You refusing to obey my order  

You can stick your order 

up your bastard arse. 

Take Lord Janos outside. 

Ollie  bring me my sword. 

You cannot do this  

Get your hands off me  

You re scum  All of you  

The boy thinks he can frighten me  

He s mistaken  yes  very mistaken. 

A disgrace  

I have friends  important friends 

in the capital  

You ll see  

If you have any last words  my Lord... 

now is the time. 

I was wrong. You re the Lord Commander  

We all serve you. I m sorry. Not only 

for this  for all I ve done and said. 

I was wrong  

My Lord  please  mercy  Mercy  

I ll go  I will  

Please. 

I m afraid. 

I ve always been afraid. 

You have served us well  my son. 

Thank you  Father  

Which of the Seven will you worship today  

The Maiden...where is the Maiden  

And the Stranger. 

  Two is extra  you realize... 

  Yes  yes. 

What are you doing  

This establishment belong to 

Lord Petyr Baelish. You can t... 

You have profaned our Faith. 

The Faith of our fathers and forefathers. 

I am the High Septon of the... 

You are a sinner. 

And you shall be punished. 

Sinner  Sinner  

Sinner  Repent  

Sinner  Sinner  

Sinner  Sinner  Sinner  

Sinner  Shame on you  

Sinner  

Sinner  

Your Grace  Grandmaester  

Lord Tyrell... 

Uh  it doesn t matter. 

As the High Septon of 

the Faith of the Seven 

I give voice to the will of the Gods 

and I am their foremost 

servant in this world. 

An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. 

An assault on my person 

is an assault on our very religion. 

You were assaulted  

I was. 

By those fanatics who 

call themselves sparrows. 

And they humiliated me  they... 

they beat me  they left me naked 

and bleeding on the cobblestones. 

I am lucky to be alive. 

I heard this all began in 

Littlefinger s brothel. 

High Septon  this is a rather 

shocking thing to hear. 

I tend to both the highest born 

and the lowliest amongst us. 

Even prostitutes may earn 

the mercy of the Mother. 

So you were administering to the 

needs of these devout prostitutes  

A man s private affairs 

ought to stay private. 

What do you want from us  High Septon  

Justice  

I ask that you protect our Faith 

by arresting these criminals 

and throw them in the black cells. 

I ask that you execute their leader  

the so called High Sparrow. 

He s a threat to everything we hold sacred. 

  If he goes unpunished... 

  And where do I find this man  

This High Sparrow  

I don t think this is a 

good idea  Your Grace. 

Nonsense  Ser Meryn. 

These are deeply religious people. 

Where can I find the High Sparrow  

Seven blessings... 

Thank the Gods. 

Just a little more. 

Thank you for the soup. 

The young man said I would find the 

High Sparrow back here. Where is he  

High Sparrow  

Sounds ridiculous  doesn t it  

Like Lord Duckling  or King Turtle. 

So  it s meant to... 

We re often stuck with the 

names our enemies give to us. 

The notion that we are all 

equal in the eyes of Seven 

doesn t sit well with some 

so they belittle me. 

  Seven blessings to you. 

  Seven blessings to you  my dear. 

It s only a name  quite 

an easy burden to wear. 

Far easier than hers. 

Why no shoes  

Because I gave them away to 

someone who needed them more. 

We all do that. 

It stops us from forgetting 

who we really are. 

Is that why you came to King s Landing  

To remind everyone  

Everyone  I have a hard 

time reminding myself. 

Well  I tell them no one s special. 

They think I m special for telling them so. 

Perhaps they re right. 

It would be comforting to 

believe that  wouldn t it  

The Gods sent you here to tempt me  

I hope not. 

I d assumed 

you d only come here to arrest me. 

For that incident with the High Septon. 

An unacceptable way to treat 

the chosen representative 

of the Gods in this 

world  wouldn t you say  

Hypocrisy is a boil. 

Lancing a boil is never pleasant. 

Although  they could have been more careful 

with the blade. 

The High Septon came to speak to me today. 

He doesn t want me to arrest you  

he wants me to execute you. 

I wouldn t presume to know 

your thoughts on the matter. 

My thoughts on the matter 

align with your own. 

The High Septon s behaviour was corosive  

as was his attitude. 

Having a man like that reside in the Sept 

eats away the Faith from the inside. 

So now he resides in the Red 

Keep s dungeons instead. 

The Faith and the Crown are the two 

pillars that hold up this world. 

If one collapses  so does the other. 

You must do everything necessary 

to protect one another. 

Your Grace. 

Send a message to Littlefinger 

in the Eyrie or wherever 

he s slythering about. 

At once  Your Grace. 

  How s your work coming along  

  Very well. 

  You ve made progress  

  More than I ve expected. 

Still a way to go  but... 

Very good. I ll leave you to it then. 

Make sure Littlefinger is clear on 

the meaning of the word  immediate . 

Shh... 

Easy  friend. 

Come on  children. 

She really is lovely. 

I hope I can make her happy. 

I hope so too. 

I ve become quite fond of Lady Sansa 

during our travels together. 

She suffered enough. 

I ll never hurt her. 

You have my word. 

I ve heard very little about you. 

Which makes you quite a rare thing  

as lords go. 

I haven t been a lord very long. 

  I was a bastard. 

  And you re not anymore. 

Allow me a moment alone with 

Lord Baelish. 

Yes  father. 

And thank you  Lord Baelish. 

I m forever in your debt. 

He seems pleased. 

Shouldn t he be  

I assure you she s still a virgin. 

Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By 

the law of the land  she s no man s wife. 

Inspect her  if you must. 

I leave that to the brothel keeper. 

It s her name I need  not her virtue. 

I have delivered everything I ve promised. 

And you prepared for the consequences. 

When the Lannisters hear I ve 

wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay. 

The Lannister name doesn t 

mean what it once did. 

Tywin is dead. 

He kept his house in power 

through sheer will. 

Without him  

Jaime has one hand and no allies  

Tommen is a soft boy  

not a king to fear. 

The Queen will be enraged. 

Queen Margaery adores Sansa. 

Cersei is Queen Mother  

a title whose importance 

wanes with each passing day. 

You noticed  still as friends 

men in important places  

whom she can ask for favours. 

A message for you  

from Cersei Lannister. 

A rider arrived from Eyrie  

shortly before dawn. 

Apparently  she thinks 

you re still in the Vale. 

A message for me  you say. 

Strange that the seal is broken. 

I m sure you understand my 

position  Lord Baelish. 

If you received word in the night 

from the Queen Mother  

it does make me question our new alliance. 

Lannisters made you one of 

the great lords of Westeros. 

Yet  here you are in the North  

undermining them. 

Why gamble with your position  

Every ambitious move is a gamble. 

You gambled when you drove a dagger 

into Robb Stark s heart. 

It appears that your gamble paid off. 

You re Warden of the North. 

I had Tywin Lannister backing. 

Who supports me now  You  

The Eyrie is mine. 

The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed 

an alliance with the lords of the North  

they brought down the greatest dynasty 

this world has ever known. 

I d like to borrow one of your birds. 

Cersei will expect a reply. 

I d like to read the reply. 

I have to get out of this wheelhouse. 

Volantis is a large city. 

I have to get out of this wheelhouse. 

The likelihood of you being spotted here 

increases a hundred fold. 

I have to get out of this wheelhouse. 

I m not sure how many new ways 

I can find of saying this. 

I will not be of any use 

to Daenerys Targaryen 

if I lose my mind. 

I can t remember the last 

face I saw that wasn t yours. 

It s a perfectly good face. 

I m losing my mind. 

If anyone recognizes you  

you ll lose more than... 

Look  we are thousands 

of miles from Westeros. 

What am I  

One more drunk dwarf. 

We have to go now. Come on. 

Hold it  hold it  

  Slaves. 

  Yes. 

The Volantene masters are very organized. 

Flies for dung shovelers. 

Hammers for builders. 

Tears for whores. 

Lest they forget. 

We should keep moving. 

The only red priest we had in 

King s Landing was Thoros of Myr. 

This one s much better looking. 

Stone men. 

Good luck stopping this spread 

of grayscale with prayer. 

You d have better luck 

dancing away the plague. 

We re going to meet the Saviour. 

You should have told me. 

Who doesn t want to meet the Saviour  

Come on. 

Let s find a brothel. 

It s even better luck 

to suck a dwarf s cock. 

See  We blend right in. 

Just two more travellers  mad with lust. 

Thank you. 

Curious hair. 

The Mother of Dragons. 

It appears you re not the 

only Targaryen supporter. 

Someone who inspires priests and 

whores is worth taking seriously. 

What makes you worth that much  

The magic. 

Well  she s taken. 

Where re you going  

I need to speak to someone with hair. 

  Hello  

  Hello. 

  You ve got no drink. 

  You ve got no money. 

Do I look like a man without money  

Never trust looks. 

Until quite recently  I was one 

of the richest men in the world. 

But who needs wealth when 

you can make a woman laugh  

I always pay my debts  

I m well known for it. 

You like her  

They all like her. 

They all want to fuck a queen. 

  Because they never met a queen. 

  You re just saying that. 

You know how to spot a liar. 

If I could pick any girl here  

I would pick you. 

Why  

Because you have a skeptical mind. 

Alright  then. I m warning you. 

You re gonna have to wash you first. 

Come on. 

I m...I m sorry  I can t. 

Of course you can. 

You re shy. 

I m not. 

Have another drink. 

Gladly  but this  I can t do. 

Believe me  no one is 

more shocked than I am. 

I hope it passes. 

What will I do in my spare time  

Go for a piss  let it stopped 

No need to worry  I was just... 

Oh... 

I thought you were someone else. 

Show is almost over. 

I m sure the girls inside 

will be happy to oblige. 

You made some kind of mistake. Why don t you 

tell me what you think you are doing and... 

I m taking you to the Queen.

That was no secret. 

But I never once disobeyed an order. 

Loyalty is the foundation 

on which the Night s Watch is built. 

And the Watch means everything to me. 

I have given my life  

we have all given our lives 

to the Night s Watch. 

Jon Snow was going to 

destroy the Night s Watch. 

 i He let the wildlings 

through our gates  i  

as no Lord Commander 

has ever done before. 

He gave them the very land 

on which they reaved 

and raped and murdered. 

Lord Commander Snow did 

what he thought was right  

I ve no doubt about that. 

And what he thought was right 

would have been the end of us. 

He thrust a terrible choice upon us. 

And we made it.

Jon was my friend. 

And those fuckers butchered him. 

Now we return the favor. 

We don t have the numbers. 

  We have a direwolf. 

  It s not enough. 

 i I didn t know Lord 

Commander Snow for long   i  

but I have to believe he wouldn t have 

wanted his friends to die for nothing. 

If you were planning to see tomorrow  

you picked the wrong room. 

We all die today. 

I say we do our best to take 

Thorne with us when we go. 

We need to fight  

but we don t need to die. 

  Not if we have help. 

  Who is gonna help us  

You re not the only ones who

  No. 

  A shame. 

I d reward the man.

I rebelled against the crown 

to arrange your marriage 

to Sansa Stark. 

Do you think that 

burning wagons in the night 

and mowing down tired  

outnumbered Baratheons 

is the same as facing a prepared 

and provisioned Lannister army  

No. 

A reckoning will come. 

We need the North to face it. 

The entire North. 

They won t back us 

without Sansa Stark. 

We no longer have Sansa Stark. 

You played your games with her. 

You played your games with the heir to the 

Iron Islands and now they re both gone. 

I have a team of men after them 

with some of my best hounds. 

 i They won t get far.  i  

I m glad to hear it.

Do you remember the first

Mother. 

All I could think about when she died 

was what would happen to her now. 

Every day  every night  

what does Mama look like now  

Has she started to bloat  

Has her skin turned black  

Have her lips peeled 

back from her teeth  

I think about locking 

Myrcella in a crypt. 

I think about her beautiful 

little face starting to collapse. 

Shh  shh. 

Don t think about it. 

I have to. 

I have to. It s not right 

she has to suffer alone. 

She s not suffering. 

She s gone. 

No one can hurt her anymore. 

She was good. 

From her first breath  

she was so sweet. 

I don t know where she came from. 

She was nothing like me. 

No meanness  no jealousy  just good. 

I know. 

 i I thought if I could 

make something so good   i  

so pure... 

  maybe I m not a monster. 

   i Listen   listen to me.  i  

She was my daughter and I failed her. 

No  I knew this would happen. 

The witch told me years ago. 

She promised me three children 

and she promised me they d die. 

 And gold their shrouds.  

Everything she said came true. 

You couldn t have stopped it. 

It s prophecy. 

It s fate. 

  You don t believe that. 

  Of course I do. 

You told me yourself 

when Father died. 

You said we had to stay together. 

You said people would try to 

tear us apart  take what s ours. 

That was a prophecy  too. 

I didn t listen to you and 

everything you said came true. 

Fuck prophecy. 

Fuck fate. 

Fuck everyone who isn t us. 

We re the only ones who matter  

the only ones in this world. 

And everything they ve taken from us  

we re going to take back and more. 

We re going to take 

everything there is.

It isn t Ser Loras

Your husband misses you dearly. 

The love between a man 

and wife is sacred. 

It reflects the love 

the gods have for all of us. 

But sin leads us away 

from the sacred. 

And only confession can purge sin. 

I have nothing to confess. 

So you believe you are pure  

Perfect  

Wholly without sin  

None of us are. 

You have started down the path. 

But you have many miles to go.

  And men. 

  And men. 

He experienced everything 

while I sat here in Dorne 

trying my best to keep my 

people alive and well fed. 

But that is life. 

We each have our roles. 

Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. 

And I was born to rule. 

The gods are not fools. 

You would have been 

a lousy adventurer.

he would have been a terrible ruler.

  Hard to know. 

Our queen is not as popular 

in Meereen as she used to be. 

The Sons of the Harpy  

Very possibly. 

Daenerys Targaryen took away 

their most valuable property  

told them human beings weren t 

even property to begin with. 

You can see why they re unhappy. 

Of course  

it could also be the freed men. 

Many of the former slaves feel 

that Daenerys has abandoned them. 

She did fly away on a 

dragon and not come back. 

It s a problem. 

Fear has brought Meereen 

to a standstill. 

Whoever you are  wherever you go  

someone in this city 

wants to murder you. 

We can t fight 

an enemy we don t know.

 i And some mutton.  i  

 i I d like some mutton.  i  

  What  

  I m not much of a hunter. 

I ll need some food if I m gonna 

make it south without starving. 

We ll give you food. 

You can bring the Red Woman 

with you if you like. 

 i Or you can leave her here with 

us  whichever you choose.  i  

But surrender by nightfall 

or this ends with blood. 

Thank you  Ser Alliser. 

We ll discuss amongst ourselves and 

come back to you with an answer. 

 i  footsteps departing   i  

Boys  I ve been running 

from men like that all my life. 

In my learned opinion  

we open that door   

And they ll slaughter us all. 

They want to come in  

they re gonna come in. 

  Aye  but we don t need to make it 

easy for them.    i Edd is our only chance.  i  

It s a sad fucking statement if 

Dolorous Edd is our only chance. 

There s always the Red Woman. 

What s one redhead gonna do 

against  armed men  

You haven t seen her do 

what I ve seen her do. 

 i Although this is TV   i  

 i it s TV in a scale that  i  

 i is beyond anything else.  i  

 i It s the most 

successful TV show in the world right now.  i  

 i It is special.  i  

 i Very  very special.  i  

 i Today we re 

shooting in Croatia   i  

 i they re shooting in Belfast   i  

 i and they re preparing for shooting 

in Seville down in Spain.  i  

 i Whatever hand you re dealt   i  

 i you have to go with it  i  

 i because the show can t stop.  i  

 i I think we re 

the only ones in the world  i  

 i that shoot with two units  i  

 i at the same time  i  

 i all season long.  i  

 i If one of those spokes  i  

 i in the wheel are missing   i  

 i it s gonna collapse.  i

Game of Thrones      A Day in the Life 

Air Date    

Morning. 

How are you all  

 i My name is Duncan Muggoch  i  

 i and I m the UK line producer  i  

 i for Croatia and Spain   i  

 i or what we also call  i  

 i the southern locations for 

 Game of Thrones  season five.  i  

 i This is my second season.  i  

 i I did Croatia last year.  i  

And this year we ve obviously got 

Spain thrown into it as well. 

So I m line producing 

both of them this year. 

And even though last year was 

big  this one s even bigger. 

 i My name is Chris Newman.  i  

 i I m one of the producers on  Game of Thrones.   i  

I fulfill a function here of 

planning how the two units work 

 i and drift in between the sets  the 

locations  and the different countries.  i  

So how was yesterday  

All right  

  Yes. Yeah  it was good. 

It was really good  yeah.   Yes  Good. 

 i We start shooting 

at the end of July.  i  

  of the crew 

have been here before. 

 i So when you start day one   i  

 i it feels like day   i  

 i in a good way.  i  

As this is going on here  

over in Spain 

we have Peter 

who runs Fresco Films. 

He s new to this year  so he doesn t 

know quite how manic it can get. 

 i My name is Peter Welter Soler.  i  

I m the Spanish line producer 

on this show. 

The production booklets  

are we getting them tonight  

 i We have two weeks 

left before everybody arrives.  i  

 i And then two days later   i  

 i we start shooting.  i  

 i I d be lying if I said the 

stress level is not increasing   i  

 i because obviously this is 

very important for all of us.  i  

 i Doing it for the first time   i  

 i we want to please everybody.  i  

 i We want to do a great job.  i  

This is actually maybe not 

the calm before the storm. 

It is the rehearsal before the show. 

We re heading from our unit base 

into Dubrovnik  into the old town. 

 i Filming here is quite different 

from filming in Belfast  i  

 i  cause the logistics over here  i  

 i are very different.  i  

 i One of the logistical  i  

 i problems of Dubrovnik  i  

 i is it s such a tight   i  

 i small  old city  i  

 i that we can t get our big 

vehicles actually into the town  i  

 i just  cause the streets  i  

 i are so narrow.  i  

 i It s just one of the 

challenges that we face  i  

filming in a city like this. 

 i You can t take vehicles  i  

 i within the old walls   i  

 i so everything has  i  

 i to get taken by Sherpas  i  

 i up to a location today  i  

 i which is probably  i  

 i one of the furthest and trickiest 

you could get to in the whole city.  i  

A little rule that I have 

for myself on location  

and this is never go up empty handed 

or come down empty handed. 

 i Now it s just a load of stairs  i  

 i all the way up to the top.  i  

Hello  gorgeous. 

Good. Good  good. 

 i The principal actors 

are just arriving on set  i  

 i to rehearse.  i  

 i They will do a rehearsal  i  

 i with the director first   i  

 i and then they ll do  i  

 i a full crew rehearsal   i  

 i which is when they ll place where the cameras 

are gonna go and everything like that.  i  

 i Okay  guys  give 

us the set  please.  i  

Hey  Joseph. How are you  

Nice to see you. 

 i Episode one and 

two have been in Croatia.  i  

They ve done most of their filming 

and they re back here finishing up 

now that Emilia 

has finished in Croatia. 

Do that. Just growl at one point. 

So this morning  episode one and 

two with Mike Slovis directing 

are setting up to do their first scene 

this season in Dany s penthouse. 

Morning  everybody. 

Hello. 

 i So it s right at the 

beginning of the   season five  i  

and it s the first time 

Dany gets an inkling 

of what s going on in Meereen 

under her new rule. 

And then do you want it 

to be a boom  

I ve decided 

I will not have them  

Or do you want it 

to be kind of like   

  No  I think it s more gentle. 

  It s gentle  

It is gentle  

Okay  lovely. Yeah. 

I have shot mostly in Belfast. 

I have shot several days 

in Croatia 

and I am going to shoot 

in Seville. 

Teach them a better way. 

It sounds like something 

Jorah would have said. 

 i Moving to a foreign 

country on this show  i  

is not as disruptive 

as you might think 

because one of the two crews 

that you ve already 

worked with here goes there. 

 i So the first thing that happens  i  

 i when you walk on the set  i  

 i is that you see familiar faces.  i  

 i My priority today 

is looking after Emilia  i  

because she s come from Croatia  

so we re matching continuity 

to that country. 

 i They send their photos to us  i  

 i so that we can do the same  i  

 i as they ve been doing.  i  

 i There s two 

departments filming at the same time   i  

so it s imperative 

that things like wigs  

continuity photos 

all travel together 

and that every member of the team 

is aware of what the look is  

 i because if we do have to 

take over someone s artist   i  

we know exactly what we re 

doing and there s no mess ups 

when we re watching 

the show  hopefully. 

 i Let s do one 

for camera  please.  i  

Okay. 

 i Let s have it quiet 

for rehearsal  please.  i  

 i And that means everybody  i  

 i in here  thank you.  i  

 i Action.  i  

So the only thing 

that gave him pride 

was knowing there was 

someone lower than he was. 

  Morning. 

  Morning. 

  How are you  

  Good. 

  Morning  Duncan. Morning  Mr. Muggoch. 

  Morning. 

Oh  I want to talk to Peter 

today or maybe you can. 

Peter Welter  

Yeah  no  I m talking with him. 

About C rdoba bridge 

and the drone. 

 i As far as I m concerned  

Bernie is  Game of Thrones.   i  

I ve never met a producer that cares 

for a crew as much as she does. 

She s an incredible woman 

to work for  actually  

and everybody loves her. 

 i And she keeps  i  

 i everything together.  i  

And do they want to 

clear a place in that  

So the bridge has to be closed. 

That s   

I m checking on. 

Along with David and Dan  

she s the executive producer. 

David and Dan are obviously   you 

know  they re the creators of it. 

 i It s their baby.  i  

 i Bernie is the one that keeps  i  

 i this show running.  i  

Sometimes David and Dan 

will be with us. 

 i Sometimes they are separate so 

that they can both be on the set   i  

 i depending  i  

 i what the scene might be   i  

will watch rehearsal  

give their notes on the scene  

and then a lot of times we re 

discussing what is in advance. 

As you can imagine  

with  episodes  

that we re constantly prepping. 

Much like our characters  we 

will go from the amazing Daznak 

right into the amazing Hardhome. 

 i I usually have a 

nice list for them every day.  i  

They almost cringe when they see 

me starting to come towards them 

and open my book to start 

asking my questions. 

 i But they re fantastically  i  

 i collaborative with all of us.  i  

Today  they re having a big 

Hardhome meeting up in Belfast. 

  They got the notes  

  Yes. Yeah. 

 i When we re shooting 

in different countries   i  

 i it s about a constant  i  

 i communication  i  

 i between the producers  i  

 i in each country.  i  

I m gonna follow Nutter 

over to Spain early. 

You re staying here 

through Illyrio s  right  

Are we doing a charter 

to Sevilla  

 i We are  yes  but I m going 

to leave ahead of time.  i  

Yeah  which goes on the . 

I ll go on the charter 

this time. 

  Hope there s a seat for me. 

  There ll be a seat for you. 

You can have Bernie s seat. 

In a week  we will all 

take off in a charter 

to go to Spain and that is now 

starting to come very close. 

 i After they have  i  

 i their big scout today   i  

then we ll have more information 

to go off of for that. 

 i We re in the 

royal palaces of Seville  i  

 i called the Real Alc zar   i  

 i which are palaces built  i  

 i by Peter the Horrible  i  

 i in the  century.  i  

It s one of the most visited 

monuments in Spain. 

 i The Alc zar will be  like   i  

 i the water gardens of Dorne.  i  

 i Since Dorne is a new world 

that s just come into the show    i  

 i it was introduced  i  

 i in the fourth season   i  

 i but we didn t  i  

 i really see it    i  

 i now in the fifth season   i  

 i they will finally get to see  i  

 i the Kingdom of Dorne.  i  

Good morning once again. 

 i It is difficult 

to shoot in a place like that  i  

because it was obviously 

not built as a set  

but built for a purpose  

a different purpose than ours. 

Some of the places  as you see 

in the balcony  for instance  

I mean  you can t possibly 

get some of the gear up there 

 i because the staircase  i  

 i is too narrow.  i  

 i So we have to get  i  

 i a crane in    i  

 i Genie Booms  cranes   i  

 i platforms    i  

 i in order to haul  i  

 i that material up there.  i  

  It s tricky  you know  

  Okay. 

 i It s not like  i  

 i a back lot studio shoot.  i  

First and second 

shooting day is up here. 

And then we move down 

to the garden. 

We ll get control of the 

garden  I m assuming  

As far as you told me  we have the 

entire garden area for us  correct  

  Yes  I have this note here. 

  It s pretty amazing. 

 i  They have  like  an average 

of   tourists in here every day.  i  

 i To see it  like  empty and have it 

just for us is just a privilege.  i  

Wherever you go  there s always 

gonna be a challenge 

because you re in a new place 

both culturally and logistically. 

We ll have to find a compromise 

where we can work 

together with the palace. 

We re the foreigners 

coming into their country  

trying to put 

this project together. 

 i I have to say they re being  i  

 i extremely nice   i  

 i which is   so we need  i  

 i to make sure that our    i  

 i which they always are    i  

 i but our crew are very careful  i  

in this delicate location. 

    And what they re 

doing for us is unique as well. 

It s never been locked off 

like this for anybody. 

All right  so will you go 

and check the others  

  Sure.   Because I think 

we re running a bit late now. 

We re now driving up to a little 

village called Magheramorne 

in which there is a quarry that s 

been there for a number of years now. 

 i And in season one  i  

 i we built the set  i  

 i of Castle Black there.  i  

 i Because there s a lake  i  

 i in the quarry   i  

 i in season two we built the 

battlements of King s Landing  i  

 i for the Battle of Blackwater  i  

 i with Stannis s boats attacking.  i  

 i It s still standing  although it s 

looking a bit worn these days.  i  

Now we re driving up to have a 

look at a set mid construction 

 i of a fishing village  i  

 i set north of the Wall.  i  

 i We ll begin to see how that s 

taking shape this morning.  i  

 i The set that we see down here   i  

 i it s a fishing village that is 

a protected fishing village.  i  

 i It s not a military  i  

 i establishment.  i  

It was designed to be 

somewhere where people 

had a living off the sea. 

 i So we needed the water   i  

 i which is why we put it  i  

 i on the edge  i  

 i of the reservoir here.  i  

The fantastic thing 

about the Hardhome set 

is we re building something 

that is so far north this time 

 i that what we get to do  i  

 i is create a fishing village  i  

 i that is exactly  i  

 i as the name describes.  i  

 i It s Hardhome.  i  

 i What we ve been doing  i  

 i both in concepts and in models  i  

 i is looking at the location  i  

 i out in Magheramorne  i  

and created what we need 

for the action  

which is a longhouse in which 

a lot of action takes place. 

 i And then we have  i  

 i the landing area   i  

 i which we re able to use the lake 

that exists in Magheramorne.  i  

And so through having those 

sort of necessary requirements  

we can then build 

this sort of tent city 

 i that will be created out there.  i  

So I had this good idea  

which I need to pitch  I guess  

which is to hold onto that shot. 

 i The director can 

now see the bones of the whole set   i  

 i so he s gonna walk through  i  

 i the set and start mapping out  i  

 i where all the things that  i  

 i he s imagined will take place.  i  

If the plan to do that shot   

it s the boater s point of view  

so it s looking 

through the fence. 

 i So anything at this point  i  

 i that the director  i  

 i would like to change   i  

 i this is the time that he has  i  

 i to turn around and say   i  

 i  Well  could I put the door  i  

 i in the hut over here    i  

 i and   Could I have this  i  

 i a bit higher   or so on.  i  

Good  so  yeah  

we good with this  

  Yeah. 

  Rock and roll  so... 

  shall we have a look...   Look at this edge 

here and see if that works. 

 i  Game of 

Thrones  is a big event   i  

and what you mustn t do 

is get put off 

by the bigness of it. 

The thing to do 

is to come in and say  

 All I ve got to worry about 

is the . 

What s in that frame.  

It must be like parachuting. 

Don t worry about 

the height you re jumping  

just make sure 

the parachute works. 

It doesn t have to be a sparrow. 

 i Today we ve got 

about  extras out  i  

and then everything 

that goes with that  

which is the extra hair people  

makeup people  

 i costume people that have  i  

 i to deal with all of that.  i  

 i Crowds start dressing 

about   this morning.  i  

 i And then just in conjunction  i  

 i with hair and makeup   i  

we re just sort of working 

around each other. 

And then everybody 

travelled to set about   

to be all set for  . 

Just need to take 

your blankets off  guys  

 i so we can look  i  

 i at your costumes  please.  i  

 i Mark Mylod is the director   i  

 i and he s now going  i  

 i to select the extras  i  

 i that he wants to feature  i  

 i in the scene.  i  

Yep  this gentleman. 

And one other lady. 

It changed a bit this morning 

because people had to look 

a bit poorer than 

we d originally intended. 

I d just like to maybe darken a 

couple of teeth or something. 

A bit of the teeth black  you 

know  just one or two of those. 

And maybe   okay  

the skin s pretty good. 

Just a little less healthy. 

And so it was a bit of a 

scramble trying to get everybody 

broken down enough to look a 

bit poorer than they had done. 

 i And it s still happening.  i  

People are still getting 

dirtied up as we speak. 

  Thank you  guys. Well done. 

  Brilliant. 

  Thank you. See you soon. 

  Thank you. 

We had more than 

  applications 

to be a background extra 

in the show. 

People from 

not only all over Spain  

but all over Europe  

even from California  

 i from Argentina   i  

 i from South Africa   i  

 i wanting to come to the casting   i  

 i wanting to be part  i  

 i of  Game of Thrones.   i  

  Hello. 

  How are you  

  Good. 

  Peter. i  Buenos d as.  i  

  i  Buenos d as.  i  

  i  Buenas tardes.  i  

  Oh  i  buenas tardes.  i  

  i  Buenas tardes  i  is the afternoon. 

Maybe you just got up. 

I just had a i  siesta.  i  

  Okay  then it s good morning again. 

  Thank you. 

There s gonna be about   

costumes to do  extras. 

 i Because it s 

such a major operation   i  

 i we re doing something like    

fittings a day  which normally we do .  i  

We fit everybody here  

males  females  in and out. 

We do guards  slaves. 

There s a rogue slave. 

 i There s a slave over there. 

Hello  slave.  i  

 i They process down here  i  

 i and these guys put on the hair.  i  

 i Jenny puts on makeup  i  

 i and they do their magic.  i  

 i We re moving around  i  

 i very quickly.  i  

We re shooting in three 

or four different places 

all straight after each other. 

But we  like  have to go in 

advance and prep    people 

all ready for a camera 

that moves behind us. 

We re basically set here. 

I like when things 

are just smooth. 

 i We ve got Lena Headey 

and Jonathan Pryce today.  i  

We re shooting a scene here 

from episode three 

 i  which is a kind of  i  

 i  rundown area  i   

 i behind the Sept of Baelor.  i  

 i And it s a scene  i  

 i where Cersei is looking  i  

 i to have a conversation  i  

 i with the High Sparrow  i  

 i who is a whole new character.  i  

We ve got a beautiful courtyard 

which is actually 

a former convent. 

And we are disguising it 

with a lot of awnings 

 i and a lot of ground cover  i  

 i on the floor.  i  

 i And it s supposed to be  i  

 i a really shocking place  i  

where Cersei encounters 

the poverty 

that she has managed to ignore 

for most of her time 

living in King s Landing. 

I m standing there 

looking butch and macho. 

  I do a lot of that. 

 i    Can you show us   i  

  That s it. That s it. 

  i  There s no...  i  

  i  No jiggling   i  

  No  that s it. 

If I jiggle  I sound 

like  Jingle Bells.  

So I can t actually move. 

I m not allowed to move. 

I have to stand still. 

 i From walking about  

we re in every street there is.  i  

It s only started 

a few days ago  

so we haven t been here 

long enough yet 

to really cause chaos  

but it ll come. 

Dubrovnik is understandably 

a big tourist attraction  

 i so you re normally fighting  i  

 i through the crowds.  i  

 i That s been a difficulty  i  

 i on the sets.  i  

Rolling  

Nice and quiet. 

  i  Roll camera.  i  

  i  Rolling   i  

  i  Rolling   i  

  i  Sound speed.  i  

  take one  C marker only. 

 i And  action   i  

I don t think this is 

a good idea  Your Grace. 

Nonsense  Ser Meryn. These 

are deeply religious people. 

Where can I find 

the High Sparrow  

 i   Cut. Cut.  i  

 i   Cut   i  

  Why did you do that  

  I don t believe you did that  

Are you all right  

  Wanker. 

  That s it  we re on strike. 

No  we re on strike. 

Fuck you. Go on. 

You get into the fucking pelican. 

See how you like it. 

No  

  i  Cut.  i  

  You know what  

I can t even lift   

I can t lift my arm 

   cause it s like a T rex. 

  Hit me  come on. 

You think you re fucking tough  

Come on. 

Come on  harder. 

Come on  harder. 

 i Belfast remains the 

heart of the whole thing.  i  

 i It s a major city   i  

 i so we have all the things  i  

that a big film crew need. 

 i But  you know  you drive  i  

 i  minutes out of the city  i  

 i and you re in the heart  i  

 i of the countryside.  i  

 i It helps with the ancient  i  

 i feel of the show  i  

 i that the landscape has  i  

 i a feeling of being old.  i  

 i It s been worn down and eroded.  i  

 i And everything has that ancient 

feel to it no matter where you go.  i  

You know  the woods feel old  

the cliff tops feel old  

and the moorlands certainly 

look old  you know. 

 i I always like to go  i  

 i to the set every day  i  

 i because that s been my heart.  i  

 i This is my  year  i  

 i in the film business  i  

 i and my heart has always  i  

 i been in making a film.  i  

 i I ve always loved the set.  i  

You can always kind of tell 

how the day is going 

by the way Chris is standing and 

looking at everyone around set. 

 i I have no idea. Some 

of them look at my face  i  

 i and think if it s looking very 

long  we must be in trouble   i  

but that s not the case. 

I might be thinking about 

something entirely different. 

I always find him 

very calm and very relaxed 

given that he s producing 

this massive  epic show. 

 i We shoot 

this year  days.  i  

 i But in those  days   i  

 i we do shoot two units   i  

 i so you double it.  i  

 i You re effectively shooting  i  

 i  days of screen time.  i  

Today on set I m mostly 

concerned with the Valyrian. 

We have a scene 

with the Valyrian language in  

 i so I m looking after the actors  i  

 i and making sure that they feel 

comfortable with their lines.  i  

 i  Cause some of the sounds are 

quite tricky to get through.  i  

 i All right  guys. 

Here we go. Shooting.  i  

 i Let s have it quiet.  i  

 i Let s roll cameras  please.  i  

 i Rolling.  i  

 i Action.  i  

I didn t conquer them. 

Their own people did. 

Find the men who did this 

and bring them to me. 

  Your Grace. 

  And cut it. 

Let s go one more time. 

Hey  Sean  I think... 

 i Right now  we 

are in a town called Osuna.  i  

 i And it has this  i  

 i beautiful old bull ring  i  

 i and it s a national  i  

 i monument as well.  i  

 i When we walked  i  

 i into this bull ring   i  

it was just the place 

they were looking for. 

 i The stone is quite similar to the 

stone they have shot in Croatia.  i  

  Made some great progress. 

  Yes. 

 i This does not 

have to be a bull ring.  i  

 i It needs to be something  i  

 i completely different   i  

 i and that s why we need to 

transform it into that place.  i  

 i Building the balcony where the actors 

are going to go to the ground.  i  

 i We had to cover up  i  

 i all the pillars.  i  

There will be a lot 

of things added to that. 

 i We re shooting just one  i  

 i single scene in here  i  

 i and it s  days.  i  

 i It s quite complex.  i  

 i There s a lot of action happening 

and we need that time.  i  

The pressure is so high 

to meet the expectancies 

of what is involved in there. 

 i It was just incredible.  i  

All right  ladies and gents  

thank you very much. 

That s a wrap for today. 

 i Quiet down  people.  i  

 i Listen  clear the cameras   i  

 i clear the lights  the equipment.  i  

 i Here was a very stable   i  

 i interesting day  i  

 i for the character Daenerys.  i  

And then  of course  we had the big 

trip out to see the set of Hardhome 

 i and it did open up  i  

 i a lot of questions  i  

 i which will continue to be  i  

 i looked at in weeks to come.  i  

You do the best you can  get 

everything as ready as you can  

and then you cross your fingers. 

 i Today went very well.  i  

 i We finished our work.  i  

 i David and Dan were happy   i  

 i which is always  i  

 i my goal of the day  i  

 i when they come out with a smile.  i  

 i Chris and I will talk  i  

 i and compare notes.  i  

Another two days down. That s the 

beauty of shooting two units every day. 

It s the only job that can 

live two days in one. 

 i At the moment  the 

main thing I m thinking about  i  

 i is getting out of Croatia.  i  

 i We ve got a lot of stuff  i  

 i to move to Spain   i  

so that s where all my thought 

is going at the moment. 

And obviously trying to set up 

Spain at the same time. 

Yeah. 

And getting through 

every day of filming. 

And knowing that 

there s big scenes coming up. 

  Yeah. 

 i    So it doesn t stop   i  

No  it doesn t stop  no. 

 i Every day there are 

things that you don t expect.  i  

Not having shot with 

any of the crew before 

obviously increases 

the stress level. 

  Hello  Croatia. 

 i    Hello  Spain.  i  

 i So  how is it all going   i  

 i As much as the 

shooting date is moving closer  i  

 i and everybody is aware  i  

 i more and more of the fact  i  

that we have less time  

yeah  stress level 

is increasing. 

Definitely. 

Definitely. 

 i Production 

arriving in the past  days  i  

 i was actually very good.  i  

 i There was a lot  i  

 i of people rolling up.  i  

 i There s probably  people  i  

 i working behind the camera.  i  

 i All right  let s 

roll cameras  please.  i  

 i   Rolling   i  

 i   Let s roll camera   i  

 i  And background action.  i  

 i The first day of 

shooting is always crucial to us  i  

 i because it shows us  i  

 i if everything we did  i  

in order to prepare it 

was the right thing. 

 i Okay  here we go.  i  

 i And  action   i  

This year  Belfast has got 

some big sets like Hardhome 

 i and the art department and construction 

have done a really great job  i  

 i of turning what was a notion  i  

 i into reality.  i  

  We shouldn t be out here alone. 

  Why not  

  If your father   

  He ll never know we re gone. 

But if he finds out... 

You don t need 

to be afraid of my father. 

Are you sure  

Yes. 

  We shouldn t go in. 

  Of course we should. 

Get out. 

Get out  

  Let s go. 

  No. 

Listen to your friend. 

They said that you 

were terrifying 

with cat s teeth and three eyes. 

You re not terrifying. 

You re boring. 

You don t know what I am. 

I know you re a witch 

and you can see the future. 

Tell me mine. 

Everyone wants 

to know their future 

until they know their future. 

This is my father s land. 

My land. 

Tell me my future or I ll have your two 

boring eyes gouged out of your head. 

Your blood. 

Give me a taste. 

Three questions you get. 

You won t like the answers. 

I ve been promised 

to the prince. 

When will we marry  

You will never wed the prince. 

You will wed the king. 

But I will be queen  

Oh  yes. 

You ll be queen. 

For a time. 

Then comes another  

younger  

 i more beautiful   i  

 i to cast you down  i  

 i and take all you hold dear.  i  

W will the king and I 

have children  

No. The king will have  

children and you will have three. 

That doesn t make sense. 

Gold will be their crowns. 

Gold their shrouds. 

Come on  we have to go. 

We have to go  

Cersei  

 i Bearers  put it down.  i  

 i Bearers  up.  i  

 i Away.  i  

 i Your Grace  we are  i  

 i honored by your presence.  i  

 i The mourners are waiting.  i  

They will keep waiting. 

I want a moment alone with him. 

But  Your Grace  many of these lords 

and ladies have travelled 

day and night to be here from 

all seven kingdoms. 

They will wait. 

He never wanted you 

to be a Kingsguard  

but here you are  

protecting his dead body. 

What he built  it s ours. 

He built it for us. 

He meant it for us. 

They re going to try 

to take it away. 

  All of it. 

  They  

All of them out there  

our enemies. 

They re waiting in line to make sure 

he s really dead. 

And as soon as they see 

the stones on his eyes  

they ll set to work 

on tearing us apart. 

They have nothing to do with it. 

The man who murdered our father  

he tore us apart. 

He s the enemy. 

I ve been telling you for years. 

You ve been defending 

him for years. 

This is exactly what they want. 

And now our father is dead 

and that little monster 

is out there somewhere drawing breath. 

Did you set him free  

Tyrion may be a monster  

but at least he killed 

our father on purpose. 

You killed him by mistake. 

With stupidity. 

You re a man 

of action  aren t you  

When it occurs to you 

to do something  you do it. 

Never mind the consequences. 

Take a look. 

Look at the consequences. 

Here they are. 

He loved you more than 

anyone in this world. 

Apologies. 

I still don t see 

why I had to stay 

in this fucking crate 

once we set sail. 

I saved your life. 

If they catch you  

they catch me. 

I cannot say 

I feel overly guilty 

about leaving you 

in that fucking crate. 

Do you know what it s like 

to stuff your shit 

through one of those airholes  

No  I only know what it s like 

to pick up your shit 

and throw it overboard. 

Pentos  

The home of my colleague 

Illyrio Mopatis  

a merchant. 

He and I met many years ago 

through mutual friends. 

A group of people 

who saw Robert Baratheon 

for the disaster he was. 

We tried to do what 

was best for the realm 

by supporting 

a Targaryen restoration. 

And thus began 

the chain of mistakes 

that has led us both here. 

Things have gotten worse  

not better. 

Westeros needs to be 

saved from itself. 

Mmm. 

Much better. 

My lord  

I don t think I am anymore. 

A lord. 

Are you a lord 

if you kill your father  

I don t imagine 

they revoke your nobility 

for killing a whore. 

It must happen all the time. 

You already drank yourself 

across the Narrow Sea. 

In a box. 

Why stop now  

Because we are talking 

about the future of our country. 

The future is shit. 

Just like the past. 

Shh. 

Shh. 

 i The Sons of the Harpy   i  

Yes  Your Grace. 

They left it on the body. 

They ve never killed before. 

It was only a matter 

of time  Your Grace. 

Conquerors always meet 

with resistance. 

I didn t conquer them. 

Their own people did. 

He did not risk his life 

fighting for his freedom 

so cowards in masks 

could take it away. 

And I did not take up 

residence in this pyramid 

so I could watch the city below 

decline into chaos. 

What was the name 

of the man you lost  

White Rat  Your Grace. 

I want him buried 

with honor  publically 

in the Temple of the Graces. 

The Sons of the Harpy 

will hear that message. 

Make them very angry. 

Angry snakes lash out. 

Makes chopping off their heads 

that much easier. 

Find the men who did this 

and bring them to me. 

Your Grace. 

Torgo Nudho. 

Missandei hin Naath. 

I wanted to speak with you. 

Why do you come  

White Rat  the Unsullied who... 

I have heard they found 

his body in a brothel. 

I have heard that 

more than one Unsullied 

has been known to visit 

Meereen s brothels. 

May I ask you why  

Why would an Unsullied 

go to a brothel  

I do not know. 

 i I must go.  i  

  Get your shield up. 

  It s too heavy. 

If it wasn t heavy  

it wouldn t stop a sword. 

Now get it up. 

Come. 

Try it again. 

Drive at me. 

Keep your shield up. 

Or I ll ring 

your head like a bell. 

Shouldn t you be training  too  

Well  I m hardly a new recruit. 

How many brothers can say that they ve 

killed a white walker and a Thenn  

I might be the first in history. 

 i   Shield up.  i  

 i   These men need a firm hand.  i  

Always have. 

They re poachers and thieves. 

Not soldiers. 

That one hates me. 

If Ser Alliser 

is chosen as the new Lord Commander... 

He hates the wildlings. 

All the wildlings. 

  Don t let them send us away. 

   i  It s not a sure thing.  i  

Ser Denys Mallister has 

commanded the Shadow Tower for  years 

and people say he s a good man. 

He s running against 

Ser Alliser   

Sam  don t let them 

send us away. 

I told you. 

Wherever you go  I go  too. 

You can t leave. 

They ll execute you. 

  Good  good  pivot. Don t forget to pivot. 

  Yah  

Shield up. 

The king wants a word. 

You re not cold  my lady  

Never. 

The Lord s fire lives 

within me  Jon Snow. 

Feel. 

Are you a virgin  

No. 

Good. 

Your Grace. 

The bastard of Winterfell. 

You know who rules 

at Winterfell now  

Roose Bolton. 

Mmm  the traitor who plunged a dagger 

in Robb Stark s heart. 

Don t you want to avenge him  

I want a great 

many things  Your Grace. 

But I m a sworn brother 

of the Night s Watch now. 

I ve been talking 

to your sworn brothers. 

  Many of them love you. 

  They re good men. 

 i Many don t.  i  

You were seen taking the body 

of a wildling girl north of the Wall. 

 i Why   i  

It s where she belonged. 

Some of the Night s 

Watch feel you have 

too much affection 

for the wildlings. 

They were born on the 

wrong side of the Wall. 

That doesn t make them monsters. 

No matter. 

I shall take back the North 

from the thieves who stole it. 

Tywin Lannister is dead. 

He can t protect them now. 

I shall mount Roose Bolton s 

head on a spike. 

But if I m to take Winterfell  

I need more men. 

The men of the Night s Watch 

are sworn to play no part   

I m not talking about 

the damn Night s Watch. 

I m talking about the wildlings. 

Your Grace  

you want the wildlings 

to march in your army  

If they swear to follow me  

I ll pardon them. 

We ll take Winterfell. 

Once the North is won  

I ll declare them 

citizens of the realm. 

I ll give them land to live on. 

It s a fair offer. 

More than fair. 

I ll offer them their lives 

and their freedom 

if Mance kneels before me 

and swears his loyalty. 

I don t think that s likely. 

You admire him  don t you  

  I respect him. 

  He likes you. 

  Convince him to bend the knee... 

  Your Grace. 

...or he burns. 

How much time do I have  

Nightfall. 

The sun drops fast 

this time of year. 

 i Hurry  Jon Snow.  i  

 i Shield up.  i  

 i Attack  my lord   i  

Attack  

Don t cross your feet. 

My sons had swords 

in their hands 

from the time they could walk. 

This one... 

 i Lord Arryn will never  i  

 i be a great warrior.  i  

 i Great warrior   i  

He swings a sword 

like a girl with palsy. 

My lord. 

 i Sword up  my lord   i  

Some boys develop more slowly. 

He s still young. 

He s . 

Boys go to war at . 

  He has other gifts. 

  Does he  

The gift of a great name. 

Sometimes that s all one needs. 

Good bye  Lord Royce  and thank you 

for all you ve done for me. 

I have done nothing more 

than my duty  my lady. 

I have no doubt 

that on my return  

Robin s skills will have 

improved immeasurably. 

He ll be safe here. 

 i As for his skills   i  

I make no promises. 

Will we head north 

at some point  

He said Sansa had a brother 

at Castle Black. 

We re a few days  ride 

from the Kingsroad. 

  But that will take us   

  Us  

The only reason you re here 

is because Jaime Lannister 

told me you weren t 

safe in the capital. 

You re hundreds of miles 

from King s Landing. 

No one knows what you look like. 

No one cares. 

You re safe. 

  But I m your squire. 

  Do you even know what a squire is  

An attendant to a knight. 

I m not a knight. 

That means you re not a squire. 

Well  where would I go  

I don t care. 

I m not your mother. 

You swore to find 

the Stark girls. 

I found Arya. She didn t want 

my protection. 

   i  Sansa still might.  i  

  Will you shut your mouth  

I didn t ask for your advice. 

I don t want anyone 

following me. 

I m not a leader. 

All I ever wanted 

was to fight for a lord I believed in. 

The good lords are dead 

and the rest are monsters. 

You told Lord Royce 

we were going to the Fingers. 

I did. 

  But we re heading west. 

  We are. 

If he wanted to betray us  

he already would have. 

Lord Royce might be as honorable 

as he thinks he is  

but he s not alone 

in that castle. 

Do you trust all those 

knights and ladies  

 i stable boys and serving girls   i  

No  do you trust the carriage driver 

or the knights escorting us  

No. 

But I pay them well 

and they ve seen what happens 

to men who disappoint me. 

So where are we going  

To a land where 

you trust everyone  

To a land so far from here  

even Cersei Lannister 

can t get her hands on you. 

It was such a deep  

deep shock to us all. 

Your father was a   

a force to be reckoned with. 

He truly was. 

I wouldn t presume to claim 

to have known him 

as such  but   

 i but just being in his presence was enough  i  

 i to make it so clear  i  

just how formidable 

a person you were dealing with. 

What a   what a force 

to be reckoned with. 

Thank you so much 

for your kind words. 

Deepest condolences  Your Grace. 

This tragedy... 

I never trusted Varys. 

I often warned... 

Your Grace. 

Cousin Lancel. 

I hardly recognized you. 

My deepest sympathies. 

I apologize 

for my son s appearance. 

Uncle  it s quite all right. 

They call themselves sparrows. 

Bloody fanatics. 

Religion has its place  

of course  

but at a certain point... 

They never would have come to the capital 

when Tywin was alive. 

I m sure he ll grow out of it  

whatever it is. 

  Excuse me. 

  Of course. 

Your wounds from the Blackwater 

seem to have healed. 

It wasn t my wounds 

that needed healing. 

What can I do for you  

You can forgive me. 

What could you possibly 

have done to warrant my forgiveness  

I led you into the darkness. 

I doubt you ve ever 

led anyone anywhere. 

I tempted you into our... 

unnatural relations. 

And  of course  

there was the king... 

his boar hunt. 

His wine. 

I don t know what 

you re talking about. 

I m a different person now. 

I ve found peace 

in the light of the Seven. 

 i You can  too.  i  

 i They watch over all of us   i  

ready to dole out mercy 

or justice. 

Their world is at hand. 

I will pray for 

your father s soul. 

The day Tywin Lannister s 

soul needs your help... 

  It looks like Dorne. 

  It doesn t. 

It does. 

That s the   

that s the Sunspear bit right there. 

And that s where 

the mountains are. 

And over here is   

is Sunsnake  

Stonespear  

Sandstone. 

Yes. 

Yes  Sandstone. 

Just there. 

Fine. 

It s Dorne. 

We should go there. 

I think we would 

have a lovely time  

judging by my experience. 

That would be wonderful. 

Dorne  Highgarden. 

Anywhere but here. 

We re late for dinner as it is. 

You re very respectful. 

I m very hungry. 

What s your name  

Olyvar  my lady. 

I m afraid my brother 

is keeping the king 

waiting  Olyvar. 

My lady. 

Perhaps you might 

consider being a bit more discreet  

Why  

They all know about me anyway. 

Everybody knows everything 

about everyone. 

What s the point in trying to 

keep a secret in a place like this  

In any event  you shouldn t 

keep your intended waiting. 

My intended  

Please. 

 i Tywin s dead.  i  

 i That means no one  i  

 i can force Cersei to marry me.  i  

  Lucky you. 

  Unlucky you. 

You think I want that woman 

married to my brother  

If she doesn t marry me  

she doesn t go to Highgarden. 

Which means she stays 

in King s Landing. 

 i Which means you re trapped here with 

Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.  i  

Perhaps. 

Perhaps  

Perhaps. 

Eunuch  the Spider  the 

Master of Whisperers. 

Imp  Half man. 

There are faster ways 

to kill yourself. 

Not for a coward. 

You are many things  my friend  

but not a coward. 

You never told me 

why you set me free. 

Your brother asked me to. 

Could have said no. 

Refuse the Kingslayer  

A dangerous proposition. 

Not as dangerous 

as releasing me. 

You risked your life  

your position  everything. 

Why  You re not family. 

You owe me nothing. 

I didn t do it for you. 

I did it for the Seven Kingdoms. 

A drunken dwarf will never be the savior 

of the Seven Kingdoms. 

I don t believe in saviors. 

I believe men of talent 

have a part to play in the war to come. 

You re going to have 

to find another soldier. 

I m done with Westeros 

and Westeros is done with me. 

You have many 

admirable qualities  

self pity is not 

one of them. 

Any fool with a bit of luck 

can find himself 

born into power. 

But earning it for yourself  

that takes work. 

I m not well suited 

for work. 

I think you are. 

You have your father s 

instincts for politics. 

And you have compassion. 

Compassion  Yes. 

I killed my lover 

with my bare hands. 

I shot my own father 

with a crossbow. 

I never said you were perfect. 

What is it you want exactly  

Peace. 

Prosperity. 

A land where the powerful 

do not prey on the powerless. 

Where the castles 

are made of gingerbread 

and the moats are filled 

with blackberry wine. 

The powerful have always 

preyed on the powerless. 

That s how they became powerful 

in the first place. 

Perhaps. 

And perhaps we ve grown 

so used to horror  

we assume there s no other way. 

 i If you sat on the Iron Throne   i  

 i would you spread misery  i  

 i throughout the land   i  

I will never sit 

on the Iron Throne. 

 i No  you won t.  i  

 i But you could help another  i  

 i climb those steps  i  

and take that seat. 

The Seven Kingdoms 

need someone stronger than Tommen  

but gentler than Stannis. 

A monarch who can intimidate the 

high lords and inspire the people. 

A ruler loved by millions 

with a powerful army 

and the right family name. 

Good luck finding him. 

Who said anything about  him   

You have a choice  my friend. 

You can stay here 

at Illyrio s palace 

and drink yourself to death  

or you can ride with me 

to Meereen  

meet Daenerys Targaryen  

and decide if the world 

is worth fighting for. 

Can I drink myself to death 

on the road to Meereen  

When did the Unsullied 

start patrolling the streets of Meereen  

Looks like your friends haven t 

been behaving themselves. 

Our mission to Yunkai 

was a resounding success. 

The Wise Masters of Yunkai 

have agreed to cede power 

to a council of elders 

made up of both 

the freed men and 

the former slaveholders. 

All matters of consequence will be 

brought to you for review. 

Good. 

They did ask 

for some concessions. 

Concessions  

Politics is the art 

of compromise  Your Grace. 

I m not a politician. 

I m a queen. 

 i Forgive me.  i  

 i You re right  of course.  i  

Still  it s easier to rule happy 

subjects than angry ones. 

I don t expect 

the Wise Masters to be happy. 

Slavery made them rich. 

I ended slavery. 

They do not ask 

for the return of slavery. 

They ask for the reopening 

of the fighting pits. 

The fighting pits  

Where slaves fought 

slaves to the death  

In the new world 

that you ve brought to us  

free men would fight free men. 

 i The pit fighters you liberated  i  

 i plead for this opportunity.  i  

Bring some here 

and ask them yourself. 

No fighting pits. 

Opening them would show 

the people of Yunkai 

and Meereen that you 

respect their traditions. 

I do not respect the tradition of 

human cockfighting. 

  If you     How many times must I say no 

before you understand  

Whatever he wants from me  

he s not going to get it. 

If he really believes 

I m going to reopen the fighting pits... 

You should reopen 

the fighting pits. 

What  

My mother was a whore. 

I told you that. 

She liked to drink pear brandy. 

The older she got  the less 

she made selling her body  

the more she wanted to drink. 

So one day when I was   

she sold me to a slaver 

she fucked the night before. 

I m sorry. 

Why  

I was a bad child. 

I wasn t big  but I was quick. 

And I loved to fight. 

So they sold me 

to a man in Tolos 

who trained fighters 

for the pits. 

I had my first match 

when I was . 

You were sold into slavery  

forced to fight to the death 

for the amusement of the masters  

and you re defending 

the fighting pits  

I m only here 

because of those pits. 

I learned to fight 

like a Dothraki screamer  

a Norvoshi priest  

a Westerosi knight. 

Soon I was famous. 

  men and women 

screamed my name 

when I stepped into the pit. 

I made so much money 

for my master  

he set me free when he died. 

I joined the Second Sons. 

And then I met you. 

You re the queen. 

Everyone s too afraid 

of you to speak truth. 

Everyone but me. 

You ve made thousands 

of enemies all across the world. 

As soon as they see weakness  

they ll attack. 

Show your strength here  now. 

That s why I have the Unsullied 

patrolling the streets. 

Anyone with a chest 

full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. 

You re not 

the Mother of Unsullied. 

You re the Mother of Dragons. 

I don t want another child s bones 

dropped at my feet. 

No one s seen Drogon in weeks. 

For all I know  he s flown halfway 

across the world. 

I can t control them anymore. 

A dragon queen with no dragons 

is not a queen. 

Viserion  

Rhaegal  

Easy. Easy. 

Easy. 

So here we are. 

Here we are. 

When we first met  

you were my prisoner. 

And now  for our last meeting... 

This doesn t have to be 

our last meeting. 

No  but it will be. 

You know what Stannis wants  

He wants me to bend the knee. 

And he wants the free folk 

to fight for him. 

I ll give him this much  

he s bold. 

Shouldn t a king be bold  

 i Oh  aye.  i  

I respect him. 

If he gets what he wants  

I expect he ll be a better ruler 

than the fools 

sitting on the Iron Throne 

the last hundred years. 

But I ll never serve him. 

You told me you weren t 

here to conquer. 

You told me your people 

have bled enough. 

That s right. 

I don t want them bleeding for 

Stannis Baratheon either. 

You spent your life convincing 

 clans to come together 

for the first time in history. 

Thenns and Hornfoots  

the ice river clans  

even the giants. 

A life s work uniting them. 

You didn t do it for power. 

You didn t do it for glory. 

You brought them 

together to save them 

 i because none of them  i  

 i will survive the winter   i  

 i not if they re north  i  

 i of the Wall.  i  

Isn t their survival 

more important than your pride  

Pride  

Fuck my pride. 

This isn t about that. 

Then bend the knee 

and save your people. 

They followed me 

because they respected me. 

Because they believed in me. 

The moment I kneel 

for a southern king  that s all gone. 

And how many tens of thousands 

are out there right now  

How many women  

How many children  

And you won t go out and rescue 

them because why  

You re afraid of looking afraid. 

Oh  I am afraid. 

No shame in that. 

How will they do it  

Beheading  

Hanging  

They ll burn you alive. 

Bad way to go. 

I ll be honest with you. 

I don t want to die. 

And burnt to death  

I don t want people 

to remember me like that  

scorched and screaming. 

But it s better than betraying 

everything I believe. 

And what happens to your people  

You preserve your dignity 

and die standing 

and they ll sing 

songs about you. 

You d rather burn than kneel. 

The great hero. 

Until winter comes and 

the white walkers come for us all 

and there s no one left to sing. 

You re a good lad. 

Truly you are. 

But if you can t understand why I won t 

enlist my people 

in a foreigner s war  

there s no point explaining. 

I think you re making 

a terrible mistake. 

The freedom to make 

my own mistakes 

was all I ever wanted. 

Mance Rayder  you ve been called 

the King beyond the Wall. 

Westeros only has one king. 

Bend the knee  

I promise you mercy. 

Kneel and live. 

This was my home for many years. 

I wish you good fortune 

in the wars to come. 

We all must choose. 

Man or woman  young or old  

lord or peasant  

our choices are the same. 

We choose light 

or we choose darkness. 

 i We choose good  i  

 i or we choose evil.  i  

We choose the true god 

or the false. 

Free folk  

 i there is only one true king  i  

 i and his name is Stannis.  i  

Here stands your king of lies. 

Behold the fate of those 

who choose the darkness. 

You alright  

Haven t been North before  

Never seen snow before. 

Beautiful  eh  

I can breathe again. 

Down south the air smells like pig shit. 

  You ve never been down south. 

  I ve been to Winterfell. 

That s the North. 

How do you live up here  

How d you keep your balls 

from freezing off  

You ve got to keep moving  

that s the secret. 

Walking s good  

fighting s better  

fucking s best. 

There s not a living woman 

within  miles from here. 

We ve got to make due with what we ve got. 

This one is maybe not so smart. 

  Davos says he s a strong fighter. 

  Good. 

That s more important than being smart. 

Smart people don t come here 

looking for the dead. 

So  you ve met this Dragon queen  huh  

And  

She will only fight beside us 

if I bend the knee. 

You spent too much time with the Free Folk. 

Now you don t like kneeling. 

Mance Rayder was a great man. 

Proud man. 

The King Beyond the Wall and everything. 

How many of us people died 

for his pride  

You still mad at us  boy  

  You sold me to a witch. 

  A priestess. 

I ll admit it  it is a subtle distinction. 

We re fighting a great war. 

  Wars cost money. 

  I wanted to be one of you. 

I wanted to join the Brotherhood 

but you sold me off. 

Like a slave. 

You know what she did to me  

She struck me down on the bed  

she stripped me naked... 

Sounds alright so far... 

And put leeches on me  

  Was she naked too  

  She needed your blood. 

  Yes  thank you  I know that. 

  Could ve been worse. 

She wanted to kill me. 

  And would have killed me if it weren t for... 

  But they didn t  did they  

So what you winging about  

I m not winging. 

Your lips are moving and you complain 

about something. That s winging. 

This one has been killed six times and 

you don t hear him bitching about it. 

Good lad. 

The first time I went north of the Wall  

was with your father. 

He was a good man. 

He deserved a better son. 

Were you with him at the end  

I was a prisoner of the wildlings. 

But we avenged him. 

I want you to know that  

every mutineer found justice. 

Can t think of a worse way for him to go. 

The Night s Watch was his life. He would 

have died to protect every one of those men. 

And they butchered him. 

I hate that he died that way. 

And my father was the most honorable man 

I have ever met. 

He was good  all the way through. 

And he died on the executioner s block. 

Your father wanted to execute me  

you know. 

I heard. 

It was in the right  of course. 

Didn t make me hate him any less. 

I m glad he didn t catch you. 

Your father gave me this sword. 

Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf. 

But it s still Longclaw. 

Lord Commander Mormont thought 

you d never come back to Westeros. 

But you are back. 

And it s been in your family for centuries. 

It s not right for me to have it. 

He gave it to you. 

I m not his son. 

I brought shame onto my house. 

I broke my father s heart. 

I forfeited the right to claim his sword. 

It s yours. 

May it serve you well. 

And your children after you. 

Father used to watch us from up here. 

He wouldn t say much. 

You probably don t remember  

you were inside knitting all the time. 

I remember. 

One times the boys were 

shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick  

I came out here after 

and Bran had left his bow behind  

just lying on the ground. 

Ser Rodrick would have 

cuffed him if he saw. 

There was one arrow in the target 

and with no one around  just like now. 

No one to stop me. 

So I started shooting. 

And every shot I had to go up there and get my 

one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. 

I wasn t very good. 

Finally  I ve hit the bullseye. 

Could ve been the  shot. Or the . 

I don t remember. 

But I hit the bull s eye. 

And I heard this. 

I looked up. 

And he was standing right here  

smiling down on me. 

I knew what I was doing 

was against the rules 

but he was smiling  so I 

knew it wasn t wrong. 

The rules were wrong. 

I was doing what I was meant 

to be doing and he knew it. 

Now he s dead. 

Killed by the Lannisters. 

With your help. 

What  

That s your pretty handwriting. 

Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles 

cause I couldn t write as well as you. 

Robb  

I write to you today with heavy heart. 

Our good King Robert is dead. 

  Killed from wounds he took in a bull... 

  You don t have to read it. 

  I remember. 

  Father has been charged with treason. 

He conspired with Robert s brothers 

against my beloved Joffrey 

and tried to steal his throne. 

The Lannisters are treating me well 

and providing me with every comfort. 

I beg you  come to King s Landing  

swear fealty to King Joffrey 

and prevent any strife between the 

great houses of Lannister and Stark 

Your faithful sister  Sansa. 

  They forced me to do it. 

  Did they  

With a knife at your throat  

Did they put you in a rack and stretched 

you till your bones started to crack  

You should have known what it was like. 

I was a child. 

So was I. 

I would have let them kill me 

before I betrayed my family. 

They told me it was the 

only way to save father. 

And you were stupid enough to believe them. 

I remember you  standing on that platform 

with Joffrey and Cersei when they 

dragged father to the block. 

I remember the pretty dress you were 

wearing  the fancy way you did your hair. 

  You were there. 

  I was there. 

Standing in the crown near Baelor s statue. 

And what did you do  Did you 

come running to the rescue  

Did you fight with the 

Lannisters and save father  

  I wanted to. 

  But you didn t. 

  Just like me. 

  I didn t betray him. I didn t betray Robb. 

I didn t betray my entire family 

for my beloved Joffrey. 

You should be on your knees thanking me. 

We re standing in Winterfell 

again because of me. 

You didn t win it back  Jon didn t win it 

back  he lost the Battle of the Bastards. 

The Knights of the Vale have won the battle 

and they rode north for me. 

While you were where  Travelling the world  

  I was training. 

  Training  

Well  while you were training  I 

suffered things you can never imagine. 

Oh  I didn t know that and 

I can imagine quite a lot. 

You never would have 

survived what I survived. 

I guess we ll never know. 

What are you going to do with that letter  

I don t know yet. 

Who did you show it to  

Where did you find it  

You re scared  aren t you  

What are you scared of  

You didn t commit any crimes. 

No one s gonna hang you. 

You re scared I ll show it to Jon 

  Arya  

  and he ll be angry. 

Not  that s not Jon. 

He ll understand  

you were just a scared little girl. 

All alone with the wicked Lannisters. 

Do you know how happy Cersei would 

be right now if she saw us fighting  

This is exactly what she 

wants  what she always wanted. 

You are scared the Northern 

lords will read it. 

They wouldn   t think much of Lady Sansa 

if they knew how she did Cersei s bidding. 

What would little Lyanna Mormont say  

She s younger than you 

were when you wrote this. 

Are you going to say  But 

I was just a child   

You re angry. 

Sometimes anger makes people 

do unfortunate things. 

Sometimes fear makes them 

do unfortunate things. 

I ll go with anger. 

You re the one they call the dog. 

Fuck off. 

They told me you were mean. 

Were your born mean or 

you just hate wildlings  

I could not give two shits about wildlings. 

Gingers I hate. 

Gingers are beautiful. 

Kissed by fire. 

Just like you. 

Don t point your fucking finger at me. 

Did you trip into the fire 

when you were a baby  

I didn t trip  I was pushed. 

Ever since  you ve been mean. 

Fuck off. 

I don t think you re truly mean. 

You have sad eyes. 

You want to suck my dick  is that it  

  Dick  

  Cock. 

Ah  dick. 

I like it. 

Bet you do. 

Nop  it s pussy for me. 

I have a beauty waiting for 

me back in Winterfell. 

If I ever get back there. 

Yellow hair  

blue eyes. 

Tallest woman you ve ever seen. 

Almost as tall as you. 

Brienne of Tarth  

  You know her  

  Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth  

Well  not with her yet. 

But I see the way she looks at me. 

How does she look at you  

Like she wants to carve you 

up and eat your liver  

You do know her. 

We ve met. 

I want to make babies with her. 

Think of them. 

Great big monsters. 

They conquer the world. 

How did a mad fucker like you 

live this long  

I m good at killing people. 

  You don t look much like him. 

  Who s that  

Your father. 

I suppose you favor your mother. 

You knew him  

Of course I did. 

When he was Hand. 

He sent me off hunting for the Mountain. 

Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman 

brought you back. 

Thoros has brought me back 

six times. 

We both serve the same lord. 

I serve the North. 

The North did not raise you from the dead. 

The Lord of Light never spoke to me. 

I don t know anything about him. I 

don t know what he wants from me. 

He wants your life. 

  Why  

  I don t know. 

That s what anyone can tell me. 

I don t know. 

So what s the point of serving a god  

none of us knows what he wants  

I think about that all the time. 

I don t think it s our purpose to understand. 

Except one thing. 

We re soldiers. 

We have to know what we re fighting for. 

I m not fighting so some man or woman I barely 

know can sit in a throne made of swords. 

So what are you fighting for  

Life. 

Death is the enemy. 

The first enemy. 

And the last. 

But we all die. 

The enemy always wins. 

But we still need to fight him. 

That s all I know. 

You and I won t fight much 

joy while we re here. 

But we can keep up the life. 

We can defend those who 

can t defend themselves. 

I am the shield that 

guards the realm of men. 

Maybe we don t need to 

understand anymore than that. 

Maybe that s enough. 

Aye. 

Maybe that s enough. 

That s what I saw in the fire. 

A mountain like an arrow head. 

Are you sure  

We re getting close. 

Do you know what I like about you  

  I honestly don t. 

  You re not a hero. 

Oh. 

I ve been heroic on occasion. 

I once charged through the Mud Gate 

of King s Landing. 

I don t want you to be a hero. 

Heroes do stupid things and they die. 

Drogo  Jorah  Daario  

even this... 

Jon Snow. 

They all try to outdo each other. 

You can do the stupidest bravest thing... 

It s interesting  these heroes you name... 

Drogo  Jorah  

Daarios  even this... 

Jon Snow... 

They all fell in love with you. 

Jon Snow is not in love with me. 

Oh  my mistake. 

I suppose he stares at you longingly because 

he s hopeful for a successful military alliance. 

He s too little for me. 

I didn   t mean... 

As heroes goes he is quite little. 

I know you re brave. 

I wouldn t have chosen a coward as my Hand. 

So... 

if all goes well  I ll finally 

get to meet your sister. 

From everything you ve told me about her 

she s rather murder me than speak. 

Oh... 

first she d torture you in some 

horrible way  then she d murder you. 

Nobody trusts my sister less than I do  

believe me. 

But if we go to the capital  

we ll go with two armies  

we ll go with three dragons  

and anyone touches you  

King s Landing burns down 

to the foundation stone. 

And right now she s thinking 

of how to set a trap. 

Of course she is. 

And she s wondering what 

trap you re laying for her. 

Are we  

Laying any traps  

If we want to create a 

new and better world  

I m not sure deceit and mass murder 

are the best ways to start. 

Which war was won without deceit and mass murder  

Yes  you ll need to be ruthless if 

you re going to win the throne. 

You need to inspire a degree of fear. 

But fear is all Cersei has. 

It s all my father had... 

And Joffrey. 

It makes their power brittle. 

Because everyone beneath 

them longs to see them dead. 

Aegon Targaryen got quite 

a long way on fear. 

He did. 

But you once spoke to me 

about breaking the wheel. 

Aegon built the wheel. 

If that s the kind of queen you want to be  

how are you different from all the 

other tyrants that came before you  

So we walk into the lion s den  

My brother promised me he d keep 

a grip on the Lannister forces. 

Forgive me  but I don t care 

about any Lannister promises. 

Except yours. 

And I promised him 

I d keep you from doing anything impulsive. 

Impulsive  

This will be a difficult negotiation. 

We re sitting down with people who 

want to see us both headless. 

My sister is likely to say 

something provocative. 

And  

And you ve been known to lose 

your temper from time to time. 

  As all our great leaders do... 

  When have I lost my temper  

Burning the Tarlys for instance. 

That was not impulsive. 

That was necessary. 

  Perhaps. 

  Perhaps. 

Perhaps the father needed 

to die and not the son. 

Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate 

the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. 

We had no time to discuss the possibility 

before you ended their possibilities. 

One can be forgiven for thinking you re 

taking your family s side in this debate. 

I am taking their side. 

You need to take your enemy s side. 

You need to see things the way they do. 

And you need to see things the way they do 

if you re gonna anticipate their actions  

respond effectively and beat them. 

Which I want you to do very much. 

Because I believe in you 

and the world you want to build. 

But the world you want to build 

doesn t get build all at once. 

Probably not in a single lifetime. 

How do we ensure your vision endures  

After you break the wheel  how 

do we make sure it stays broken  

You want to know who sits on the 

Iron Throne after I m dead  

You say you can t have children. 

But there are other ways 

of choosing a successor. 

The Night s Watch has one method  

The Iron born folk  

among their many flaws... 

We will discuss the succession 

after I wear the crown. 

Your Grace  I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards 

you when you fought on Blackwater Rush  

and I saw hundred of arrows miss. 

But any one of them could have 

found your heart and end... 

You ve been thinking about my 

death quite a bit  haven t you  

Is this one of the items you ve discussed 

with your brother in King s Landing  

I m trying to serve you by 

planning on the long term. 

Perhaps if you d planned 

for the short term  

we wouldn t have lost Dorne and Highgarden. 

We will discuss the succession 

after I wear the crown. 

Prepare. 

Big fucker. 

Do bears have blue eyes  

We have to get him back to Eastwatch. 

Flask. 

Go on. 

You alright  

I just got bit by a dead bear. 

Aye. 

You did. 

Funny old life. 

Alright then. 

  Where did she get it  

  I don t know. 

She seems very resourceful. 

You re worried. 

We re asking   men to fight with us 

in the worst winter any 

of them have ever seen. 

The weather will be the 

least of their problem. 

Many of them will be happy to 

find a good reason to go home. 

You question their loyalty  

Their loyalty is to Jon. 

Jon is not here. I haven t 

heard from him in weeks. 

You re the Lady of Winterfell. 

The King chose you to rule in his absence. 

And rule you have. 

Wisely. 

Ably. 

They see that  they respect you. 

Some may even prefer you. 

Yes  they turned their backs on Jon 

when it was time to retake Winterfell 

and then they named him their king and now 

they re ready to turn their backs on him again. 

How far would you trust men like that  

Bloody Windbanes. 

If they found out I wrote that letter... 

a woman who s already married not 

one but two enemies of her House... 

By the time Jon comes back  

he ll have no army left. 

Arya is not like them. 

She s your sister. 

You may have disagreements  

but she would never betray her family. 

She would if she thought 

I was going to betray Jon. 

Is that what she thinks  

I don t know what she thinks. 

I don t know her anymore. 

Perhaps Lady Brienne can help. 

She s sworn to protect both 

of Catelyn Stark girls. 

Did she not  

She is. 

And if one of you were planning 

to harm the other in any way  

wouldn t she be on about to intercede  

She would. 

Something I ve always wanted to know. 

Alright. 

How drunk were you when you charged 

through the breach on Pyke  

For being honest  I don t remember 

charging through the breach. 

Some of the lads told me 

about it the next morning. 

Some damn good scrap. 

Alright. 

It was a proper scrap. 

The Ironborn thought you were 

some kind of god. 

The way you were waving that flaming sword. 

I thought you were the bravest man 

I ever saw. 

Just the drunkest. 

Where s the rest of them  

If we wait long enough 

we ll find out. 

Go back to Eastwatch. 

Get a raven to Daenerys  

tell her what s happened. 

  I m not leaving you. 

  You re the fastest. 

Go  Now  

You re faster without the hammer. 

Give it  

Give it  

Stop  

Go  

What happened  

Where are the others  

Raven. 

We need to send the raven. 

Get the maester  Now  

Thoros  

Thoros  

They say it s one of the better ways to go. 

Lord of Light  

show us the way. 

Come to us in our darkness and 

lead your servant into the light. 

We have to burn his body. 

And all the clothes behind him. 

Unless the Lord of Light is kind 

enough to send us a bit of fire. 

Come to us in our darkness. 

For the night is dark and full of terrors. 

We ll all freeze soon. 

I saw the water. 

When you killed the white walker  

almost all the dead that followed it fell. 

Why  

Maybe he was the one who turned them. 

We can go for the walkers. 

  Maybe we ll stand a chance. 

  No. 

We need to take that thing back with us. 

There s a raven flying for Dragonstone now. 

Daenerys is our only chance. 

No. 

There s another. 

Kill him. 

He turned them all. 

You don t understand.  

The Lord brought you back... 

and he brought me back... 

No one else  just us. 

Did he do it to watch us freeze to death  

Careful  Beric  you ve lost your priest. 

This is your last life. 

I ve been waiting for the end for a long time. 

Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it. 

Every Lord I ve ever met it s been a cunt. 

Can t see why the Lord of Light 

should be any different. 

Milady. 

Milady. 

It s an invitation. 

To King s Landing. 

  Milady  you are the Lady of Winterfell. 

  I am. 

And you will represent my interest 

at this gathering as you see them. 

They invited you  they want you there. 

I will not set foot in King s Landing while 

Cersei Lannister is queen. 

They want another Stark prisoner  

they can come and take me. 

Until then  I ll remain where I belong. 

I have work to do here. 

It s not safe. 

Ser Jaime will be there. 

You said he treated you honourably before. 

I m not worried about me. 

It s not safe leaving 

you with Littlefinger. 

I have many guards who d happily 

imprison him or behead him 

whether or not you re here. 

And you trust their loyalty  

You trust he hasn t been speaking 

to them behind your back  

Let me at least leave Podrick 

behind to watch over you. 

He has become a competent swordsman. 

I do not need to be watched 

over or minded or cared for. 

I m not a child  I am the Lady 

of Winterfell and I am home. 

This is the safest place for me. 

Milady. 

I sworn an oath to protect 

you and your sister. 

If I abandon you... 

The trip to King s Landing 

is long  Lady Brienne  

and you won t be travelling 

on summer roads. 

The sooner you leave  the better 

your chances of making it on time. 

Yes  Milady. 

You can t  

The most important person in the world can t 

fly to the most dangerous place in the world. 

  Who else can  

  No one. 

They knew the risk when they left. 

You can t win the throne if you re dead. 

You can t break the wheel if you re dead. 

  So what would you have me do  

  Nothing. 

Sometimes nothing is the 

hardest thing to do. 

If you die 

we re all lost. 

Everyone  everything... 

You told to do nothing before 

and I ve listened to you. 

I m not doing nothing again. 

Damn cunt. 

Oh  fuck. 

Fall back  

Fall back  

Come on  

Help me  

Jon  

Go  

Go now  Leave  

Uncle Benjen  

You ride for the pass. 

Come with me. 

There s no time. 

Go  

We ll meet again  Clegane. 

Fucking hope not. 

It s time to go  Your Grace. 

A bit longer. 

Not what you re looking for  

I have hundreds of men here at 

Winterfell  all loyal to me. 

They re not here now. 

  What are these  

  My faces. 

  Where did you get them  

  In Braavos  

while I was training to be a faceless man. 

What does that mean  

Back in Braavos  before 

I got my first face  

there was I game I used to play. 

The game of faces. 

It s simple  I ask you a 

question about yourself 

and you try to make a lie 

sound like the truth. 

If you fool me  you win. 

If I catch a lie  you lose. 

Let s play. 

I don t want to play. 

How do you feel about Jon being king  

Is there someone else you feel should 

rule the North instead of him  

Those faces  what are they  

Is that what you should be asking  

Are you sure  

The game of faces didn t turn out so well 

for the last person who asked me questions. 

Tell me what they are  

We both wanted to be other people when 

we were younger. 

You wanted to be a queen. 

To sit next to a handsome young king 

on the Iron Throne. 

I wanted to be a knight 

To pick up a sword like 

father and go off to battle. 

Neither of us got to be the other person  

did we  

The world doesn t just let girls 

decide what they are going to be. 

But I can now. 

With the faces I can choose. 

I can become someone else. 

Speak in their voice  live in their skin. 

I can even become you. 

I wonder what it would feel like 

to wear those pretty dresses. 

To be the Lady of Winterfell. 

All I d need to find out 

is your face. 

I m sorry. 

I m so sorry. 

I wish I could take it back. 

I wish we d never go. 

I don t. 

If we hadn t gone I wouldn t have seen. 

You have to see it to know. 

Now I know. 

The dragons are my children. 

They re the only children I ll ever have. 

We are going to destroy the Night King 

and his army. 

And we ll do it together. 

You have my word. 

Thank you  Dany. 

Dany... 

Who was the last person who called me that  

I m not sure  was it my brother  

Not the company you want to keep. 

Alright. 

Not Dany. 

How about  My Queen   

I d... 

bend the knee but... 

What about those who 

swore allegiance to you  

They ll all come to see 

you for what you are. 

I hope I deserve it. 

You do. 

You should get some rest. 

  Magnificent. 

  Mm hmm. 

Looks fresh forged. 

It is. 

No one s made a Valyrian 

steel sword 

since the Doom of Valyria. 

There are three living smiths 

who know how to rework 

Valyrian steel. 

The finest of them 

was in Volantis. 

Came here to King s Landing 

at my invitation. 

Where did you get 

this much Valyrian steel  

From someone who no longer 

had need of it. 

You ve wanted one of these 

in the family for a long time. 

  And now we have two. 

  Two  

The original weapon 

was absurdly large. 

Plenty of steel for two swords. 

Well  thank you. 

It s glorious. 

You ll have to train 

your left hand. 

Any decent swordsman 

knows how to use both hands. 

You ll never be as good. 

No. 

But as long as I m better 

than everyone else  

I suppose it doesn t matter. 

You can t serve in the 

Kingsguard with one hand. 

Where s that written  

I can and I will. 

The Kingsguard oath 

is for life. 

The war is over. 

The king is safe. 

The king is never safe. 

How many people in this city alone 

would love to see his head on a pike  

Other knights protected the 

king while you were a prisoner. 

They will continue 

to do so when you go home. 

  Home  

  You ll return to Casterly Rock 

 i and rule in my stead.  i  

You are the Lord 

of Casterly Rock. 

I am the King s Hand. 

My place is here. 

I don t expect to see 

the Rock again before I die. 

You know what they call me  

Kingslayer. 

Oathbreaker. 

Man without honor. 

Now you want me to break 

another sacred vow. 

You won t be breaking anything. 

There is a precedent to relieve 

a Kingsguard of his duties. 

The king will exercise 

that prerogative. 

  No. 

  No  

No. 

I don t believe 

I asked you a question. 

  There s my answer. 

  If you think your bloody honor comes before... 

My bloody honor 

is beyond repair  

but my answer is still no. 

I don t want Casterly Rock. 

I don t want a wife. 

I don t want children. 

What do you want  

Supper would be nice. 

For  years 

I ve tried to teach you. 

If you haven t learned by now  

you never will. 

Go. 

 i If serving as a glorified  i  

 i bodyguard  i  

is the sum of your ambition  

go serve. 

I suppose you want 

the sword back. 

Keep it. 

A one handed man with no family 

needs all the help he can get. 

How many Dornishmen 

does it take to fuck a goat  

Please don t. 

 i Seems to me the smart place  i  

 i to meet travelers  i  

 i is in a tavern.  i  

That way  one party is late  

the other party can drink 

some ale inside. 

This is the Prince of Dorne 

we re waiting for  

not one of your 

sellsword friends. 

If he s so damned important  how 

come they sent you to meet him  

There s bad blood between 

the Martells of Dorne 

and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. 

Has been for years. 

And just in case 

the Martells of Dorne 

are looking to spill 

some Lannister blood  

  it may as well be yours  eh  

  No need for cynicism. 

  I happen to be an accomplished diplomat. 

  Oh. 

Ah  here we are. 

 i Can you read the sigils   i  

Yellow balls  

Wild lemons on a purple field  

House Dalt of Lemonwood. 

A vulture grasping a baby in 

its talons  House Blackmont. 

A crowned skull  

the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave. 

Boy knows his Dornish Houses. 

I need a sigil. 

And House Martell  a red 

sun pierced by a spear  

I don t see it  my lord. 

Well met  my lords. His Grace King 

Joffrey welcomes you in his name. 

My lord father  the King s Hand  

sends his greetings as well. 

I am Tyrion Lannister 

of Casterly Rock  

Master of Coin. 

Forgive me. I don t see 

Prince Doran in your company. 

The prince s health forces 

him to remain at Sunspear. 

He sends his brother 

Prince Oberyn 

 i to attend the royal  i  

 i wedding in his stead.  i  

Yes  the king will be delighted 

to enjoy the company 

of a warrior as renowned as Prince 

Oberyn at his wedding feast. 

Will he  

And where is Prince Oberyn  

Arrived before dawn. 

Not a man for welcome parties  

 i our prince.  i  

Very well. My lords  these 

fine men from the City Watch 

will escort you to your 

quarters in the Red Keep. 

You must be weary 

after such a long journey. 

Some accomplished 

diplomacy that was. 

Now where  

We must find Prince Oberyn before he 

kills somebody or several somebodies. 

How do you plan on finding a single 

Dornishman in a city this big  

You re famous for fucking 

half of Westeros. 

You just arrived at the capital 

after two weeks of bad roads  

where would you go  

I d probably go to sleep  

but I m getting old. 

Look at this one. 

How lovely is she  

Beautiful. 

But pale. 

They like them pale 

in the capital. 

Shows they don t 

work the fields. 

Do I frighten you  

You like  

Timid. 

Timid bores me. 

You re a bit of mischief  

aren t you  

I think she likes you. 

She has good taste. 

You re not timid  are you  

Not timid. 

Do you like women  

When they look 

like her  my lord. 

This one will do nicely. 

 i Very good  my lady.  i  

Oh  I m not a lady. 

A term of courtesy 

in this establishment. 

A lie anywhere. 

Why not use the right words  

I m a bastard. 

She is a whore. 

And you re what  

A procurer. 

Any of the others  

The two girls can leave. 

You stay. 

I m afraid I m not 

an offer  my lord. 

Everyone who works for 

Littlefinger is an offer. 

Take off your clothes. 

We ll be here a while. 

  My lord. 

  I am a prince  boy. 

Have you ever been 

with a prince  

Can t say I have. 

I m wildly expensive. 

Take off your clothes. 

Which way do you like it  

My way. 

 i     And so he spoke  i  

 i and so he spoke      i  

 i     That Lord of Castamere      i  

   i      And now the rains...      i  

  Oberyn. 

   i      Weep o er his hall...      i  

  Oberyn  don t. 

 i     With no one there to hear      i  

    Yes  not the rains 

weep o er his hall     

    And not a soul 

to hear.     

You lost  friend  

Forgive me for staring. 

I don t see many 

Lannisters where I m from. 

I don t see many 

Dornishmen in the capital. 

We don t like the smell. 

  Come with me  lover. 

  Gods  look at this one. 

Sirs  if you follow me  I ll 

arrange for a private room. 

Why are you wasting a woman 

like this on a Dornishman  

Bring him a shaved goat 

and a bottle of olive oil. 

Do you know why all the world 

hates a Lannister  

You think your gold 

and your lions 

and your gold lions 

make you better than everyone. 

May I tell you a secret  

You re not a golden lion. 

You re just a pink little man 

who is far too slow 

on the draw. 

Longsword is a bad option 

in close quarters. 

When I pull my blade  

your friend starts bleeding. 

Quite a lot  I m afraid. 

So many veins in the wrist. 

He ll live if you 

get him help straightaway. 

So  decisions. 

Prince Oberyn  

forgive the intrusion. 

We heard there might be... 

trouble. 

Apologies  my love. 

I m here to welcome you 

to the capital. 

Ellaria Sand  my paramour. 

The king s own Uncle Imp. 

Tyrion  son of Tywin Lannister. 

If there s anything 

I can do to make your stay... 

What are you  

His hired killer  

It started that way  aye. 

Now I m a knight. 

How did that come to pass  

Killed the right people  

I suppose. 

We ll need a few more girls. 

Girls  yes  

You don t partake  

Oh  I partook. 

Now I m married. 

Prince Oberyn  if I may  

a word in private  

Seems I visited the Lannister 

brothel by mistake. 

  Oh  they take all kinds. 

  Even Dornishmen. 

The king is very grateful that you 

traveled all this way for his wedding. 

Let us speak truth here. 

Joffrey is insulted. 

I am only the second son 

after all. 

Well  speaking 

as a fellow second son  

I have grown rather used 

to being the family insult. 

Why did you come to King s 

Landing  Prince Oberyn  

I was invited 

to the royal wedding. 

I thought we were 

speaking truth. 

The last time I was in the 

capital was many years ago. 

Another wedding. 

My sister Elia 

and Rhaegar Targaryen  

the Last Dragon. 

My sister loved him. 

She bore his children. 

Swaddled them  rocked them  

fed them at her own breast. 

Elia wouldn t let 

the wet nurse touch them. 

And beautiful  noble 

Rhaegar Targaryen 

left her for another woman. 

That started a war 

and the war ended right here 

when your father s army 

took the city... 

I wasn t actually present. 

And butchered those children. 

My nephew and niece. 

Carved them up and wrapped 

them in Lannister cloaks. 

And my sister  you know 

what they did to her  

I m asking you a question. 

I ve heard rumors. 

So have I. 

The one I keep hearing is that 

Gregor Clegane the Mountain 

raped Elia 

and split her in half 

with his great sword. 

I wasn t there. 

I don t know what happened. 

If the Mountain 

killed my sister  

your father gave the order. 

Tell your father I m here. 

And tell him the Lannisters aren t 

the only ones who pay their debts. 

Shh. 

Shh. Shh. 

They re dragons  Khaleesi. 

They can never be tamed. 

Not even by their mother. 

  Ser Barristan. 

  Your Grace. 

Where s Daario Naharis  

Where s Grey Worm  

Gambling  Your Grace. 

Gambling  

  Mhysa. Mhysa. 

  Mhysa... 

How long have they been at it  

Since midnight  Your Grace. 

Ser Worm is stronger 

than he looks. 

But I can see his arms 

beginning to shake. 

What s the prize to winning 

this stupid contest  

The honor of riding by your 

side on the road to Meereen. 

That honor goes to 

Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan 

as neither of them kept 

me waiting this morning. 

You two will ride in the rear 

guard and protect the livestock. 

The last man holding his sword 

can find a new queen 

to fight for. 

You need to eat something. 

Pigeon pie. 

No  thank you. 

Lemon cakes  

No  thank you. 

You love lemon cakes. 

Tell her she needs to eat. 

My lady  you do need to eat. 

I don t need to eat. 

If I could have a moment 

alone with my wife. 

She needs to eat. 

I can t let you starve. 

 i I swore to protect you.  i  

My lady  

I am your husband. 

Let me help you. 

How can you help me  

I don t know  but I can try. 

I lie awake all night 

staring at the canopy 

thinking about how they died. 

I could get you essence of 

nightshade to help you sleep. 

Do you know what 

they did to my brother  

How they sewed his direwolf s 

head onto his body  

And my mother. 

They say they cut 

her throat to the bone 

and threw her body 

in the river. 

 i What happened to your family  i  

 i was a terrible crime.  i  

I didn t know your brother. He seemed 

like a good man  but I didn t know him. 

 i Your mother  on the other hand   i  

 i I admired her.  i  

She wanted to have me executed  

but I admired her. 

She was a strong woman. 

And she was fierce 

when it came to 

protecting her children. 

Sansa. 

Your mother would want 

you to carry on. 

You know it s true. 

Will you pardon me  my lord  

I d like to visit the godswood. 

Of course. Of course. Prayer 

can be helpful  I hear. 

I don t pray anymore. 

It s the only place I can go 

where people don t talk to me. 

My lion. 

What are you doing  

What does it look like 

I m doing  Come here. 

How many times have I told you  

You can t visit me here. 

I know. 

I know. 

We have come 

to a dangerous place. 

Have you forgotten me  Do you 

know how long it s been  

Of course I haven t forgotten. 

I want you. 

Don t you want me  

Things are a bit tense 

right now. 

What things  

My nephew the king 

wants to murder me. 

My wife hates me because my 

father murdered her family. 

Oberyn Martell wants to murder 

everyone whose last name is Lannister. 

You need to relax. 

Don t you want to relax  

  What s wrong  

  I told you. 

  It s not a good time. 

  It s never a good time. 

  You have your child bride now. 

  Shae. 

  Do you love her  

  Love her  

I barely know her. 

She s a child. 

  She despises me. 

  That s not an answer. 

Of course I don t love her. 

You tried to ship me away. 

Ship you away  

Give me diamonds 

and make me disappear. 

What in the world 

are you talking about  

If you want me to leave  

just say it. 

  Say it  

  Shh. 

I don t know what 

you re talking about. 

You want me to stay  

A work of art  really. 

The craftsmanship is excellent. 

You like it so much  you re welcome to 

chop off your own hand and take it. 

Such an ingrate. I spent 

days with the goldsmith 

  getting the details just right. 

  Days  

Better part of an afternoon. 

There  how does that feel  

Uh... 

a hook would be more practical. 

Elegant  I think. 

Thank you for your help 

with the other matter. 

  The symptoms have abated  

  Gone completely. 

I am in your debt  

Maester Qyburn. 

Not a maester  Your Grace  

but happy to help 

whenever I can. 

Odd little man. 

I ve grown rather fond of him. 

He s quite talented  you know  

What symptoms  

Symptoms that are 

not your concern. 

You let him touch you  

You jealous  

I m surprised. 

You never let Pycelle near you. 

You think I d let 

that old lecher 

put his hands on me  

He smells like a dead cat. 

 i I m not sure I ve ever  i  

 i smelled a dead cat.  i  

Well  they smell like Pycelle. 

You drink more 

than you used to. 

  Yes. 

  Why  

Let s see  you started a brawl 

in the streets with Ned Stark 

and disappeared 

from the capital. 

My husband died in a tragic 

hunting accident. 

It must have been 

traumatic for you. 

My only daughter 

was shipped off to Dorne. 

 i We suffered through a siege.  i  

A rather short siege. 

A rather short siege that I 

didn t expect to survive. 

And now I m marrying 

my eldest son 

to a wicked little 

bitch from Highgarden 

while I m supposed 

to marry her brother  

a renowned pillow biter. 

So... 

Father disowned me today. 

He can t disown you. 

You re all he s got. 

You re forgetting Tyrion. 

You don t really plan on staying 

in the Kingsguard  do you  

Staying in the Kingsguard 

means I live right here 

in the Red Keep with you. 

  Not now. 

  I want... 

Not now  When  

I ve been back for weeks. 

  Something s changed. 

  Everything s changed. 

You come back after all 

this time with no apologies 

and one hand and expect 

everything to be the same  

What do you want me 

to apologize for  

For leaving me. 

You think I wanted 

to be taken prisoner  

Don t know what you wanted. 

You weren t here. 

You left me alone. 

Every day I was a prisoner  

I plotted my escape. 

Every day. I murdered people 

so I could be here with you. 

  You took too long. 

  I... 

  What are you saying  

  I m saying you took too long. 

  Come in. 

 i   Go away.  i  

Forgive me  Your Grace. 

You told me to come at once if 

there was anything important. 

You plan on killing 

all the crows yourself  

Do you plan on sitting here 

scratching your balls till winter  

We wait for Mance s orders. 

You sent a man over the Wall 

at the full moon. 

 i If he s not back yet   i  

 i he s not coming back.  i  

 i And what is it you want   i  

March on Castle Black 

with just this lot  

Your pretty crow said   

men are nesting there. 

Yeah  well  he s a liar. 

He is  

Shouldn t it be  he was   

You said you put 

three arrows in him. 

I did. 

I ve seen you slip a shaft through 

a rabbit s eye at  yards. 

If that boy s still walking  

it s  cause you let him go. 

Thenns. 

I fucking hate Thenns. 

Mance sent you  

How did you find us  

You came from the south  

not the north. 

Took a detour. 

Got some supper from 

a village down that way. 

 i Why does the meat down here  i  

 i taste so much better  i  

than it does 

on our side of the Wall  

Help yourself. 

Maybe everything s 

just better fed down here. 

Fat and lazy. 

Easier for us  hmm  

You didn t see us coming  

Lost your warg  

And that baby crow 

you had with you  

lost him too  

I ll answer to Mance. 

I won t answer to you. 

She yours  

I m not anybody s. 

Too scrawny. 

Not like those crows 

at Castle Black. 

 i Think of them  i  

 i stuck in their larders  i  

stuffing their faces 

with ham and blood sausage 

and stew  getting nice and fat 

and marbled. 

I know we ve had 

our differences  Tormund  

but just one time 

before you die  

you really ought to try crow. 

 i Draw.  i  

Loose. 

 i Last time I saw him   i  

 i he was in the courtyard  i  

 i at Winterfell.  i  

 i He said   Next time I see you   i  

 i you ll be all in black.   i  

I was jealous of Robb 

my whole life. 

 i The way my father  i  

 i looked at him   i  

 i I wanted that.  i  

He was better than me 

at everything... 

fighting and hunting 

and riding 

and girls. 

 i Gods  the girls loved him.  i  

I wanted to hate him  

but I never could. 

Sometimes I want to hate you. 

Well  you re better 

than me at everything. 

Except reading. 

They re... 

they re ready for you. 

He s wanted to hang me for a while. 

Now s his chance. 

No one s going to hang you. 

You ve done nothing wrong. 

I ve done plenty wrong. 

So you admit you 

murdered Qhorin Half hand  

 i I didn t murder him.  i  

No  

You put your sword 

through a brother 

of the Night s Watch. 

What do you call that  

He wanted me to kill him. 

A bastard son of a traitor. 

What would you expect  

The Half hand believed 

our only chance 

to stop Mance was to get 

a man inside his army. 

Don t talk about the Half hand as 

if you knew him. He was my brother. 

Then you d know he d do 

anything to defend the Wall. 

The free folk would have boiled him 

alive  but letting me kill him... 

 i   The free folk   i  

 i   Listen to him.  i  

He even talks like 

a wildling now. 

Aye  I talk like a wildling. 

I ate with the wildlings. 

I climbed the Wall 

with the wildlings. I... 

I laid with a wildling girl. 

You admit to breaking 

your vows  then  

I do. 

The law is the law. 

The boy must die. 

If we beheaded every ranger 

who lay with a girl  

the Wall would be manned 

by headless men. 

There s a difference 

between sneaking off 

to the Mole s Town brothel 

and sleeping with the enemy. 

While we sit here 

debating which rules I broke  

Mance Rayder marches on the 

Wall with an army of  . 

Impossible. 

You can t get 

 wildlings together 

before they start 

killing each other. 

 . 

He s united the Thenns  

 i the Hornfoots   i  

 i the ice river clans.  i  

He has giants fighting for him. 

Giants  

Have you ever been 

beyond the Wall  ser  

I commanded the City Watch 

of King s Landing  boy. 

And now you re here. You must not 

have been very good at your job. 

How dare you   

There s a band of wildlings 

south of the Wall already 

led by Tormund Giantsbane. 

I killed their warg 

and three others. 

They shot me full of arrows. 

Their orders are to attack 

Castle Black from the south 

when Mance hits 

it from the north. 

The signal for the attack 

will be a bonfire. 

Mance said it would be 

the greatest fire 

the North has ever seen. 

 i That s the truth.  i  

All the truth. 

Do you intend to execute me 

or am I free to go  

None of us are free. 

We are men 

of the Night s Watch. 

But we won t be taking 

your head today  Jon Snow. 

Go on. 

I am acting commander here  

Maester Aemon. 

Yes  you are. 

And I don t trust the bastard. 

He told the truth. 

And you always know 

when a man s telling a lie  

How did you acquire 

this magical power  

I grew up in King s Landing. 

 i No. No.  i  

You re a queen  not an ox. 

Your grandfather 

gave me a necklace 

just like this one 

for my  nameday. 

The wedding is in 

a fortnight  Grandmother. 

You can t say no to everything. 

Nonsense. 

My little dears. 

Go and speak to the 

jewelers of King s Landing. 

Tell them who you are  

tell them who sent you. 

The one who brings 

me the best necklace 

will get to keep the next best. 

The Margaery Tyrell 

who walks into the sept 

a fortnight from now 

will inspire   songs. 

Now  how sad it will be if she s 

wearing rubbish like that. 

Perhaps I should just let 

Joffrey choose it for me. 

End up with a string of dead 

sparrow heads around my neck. 

You watch that. 

Even here  even with me. 

My word. 

My lady. 

My lady. 

Please pardon me 

for interrupting. 

My name is Brienne of Tarth. 

We know who you are. 

We ve heard all about you. 

But hearing is one thing. 

Aren t you just marvelous  

Absolutely singular. 

I hear you knocked 

my grandson into the dirt 

like the silly little 

boy he is. 

My lady  I know this is 

a very busy time for you  

but if I could 

just have a moment. 

You dare not refuse. 

A shadow  

A shadow with the face 

of Stannis Baratheon. 

I swear to you by all 

the gods it was Stannis. 

He plunged his sword 

through Renly s heart 

and disappeared. 

One day  my lady  

I will avenge our king. 

Joffrey is our king now. 

I meant no offense. 

And you ve given none. 

All the Kingsguard 

will be on duty  of course. 

Ser Boros 

will be stationed here. 

Ser Preston 

will be stationed here 

beside the primary 

entertainment. 

Your Grace  

Yes  yes  one guard at the... 

the thing. 

Go on. 

Ser Meryn will guard 

Lady Margaery and Tommen. 

I ve always guarded 

the king himself  my lord. 

Ever since your absence. 

And I thank you 

for it  Ser Meryn. 

All very good. 

I don t expect any trouble. 

The people love their king. 

They know who keeps them fed. 

Margaery Tyrell  I ve heard. 

By my leave. 

They know I saved the city. 

They know I won the war. 

The war s not won. 

Not while Stannis lives. 

I broke Stannis 

on the Blackwater. 

Pity you weren t 

there to help  Uncle. 

My apologies  Your Grace. 

I was rather busy. 

Busy getting captured. 

So this is the famous 

 Book of Brothers   

All the great deeds 

of all the great Kingsguard. 

Ser Arthur Dayne. 

The Sword of the Morning. 

Led the attack on the 

Kingswood Brotherhood. 

Defeated the Smiling Knight 

in single combat. 

Ser Duncan the Tall. 

Four pages for Ser Duncan. 

He must have been quite a man. 

So they say. 

Ser Jaime Lannister. 

Someone forgot to write down 

all your great deeds. 

  There s still time. 

  Is there  

For a  year old knight 

with one hand  

How can you protect me 

with that  

I use my left hand 

now  Your Grace. 

Makes for more of a contest. 

Have you ever been to Meereen  

Several times  Your Grace  

with Master Kraznys. 

And  

They say   slaves died 

building the Great 

Pyramid of Meereen. 

And now an army 

of former slaves 

is marching to her gates. 

You think the Great 

Masters are worried  

If they re smart  Your Grace. 

You were told to ride 

at the back of the train. 

Yes  my queen. 

But I need to speak to you 

about something important. 

A matter of strategy. 

Your Grace. 

All right  what is this 

matter of strategy  

A dusk rose. 

Would you like to walk at the back 

of the train instead of riding  

And this one s called 

lady s lace. 

Would you like 

to walk without shoes  

You have to know 

a land to rule it. 

Its plants  its rivers  

its roads  its people. 

Dusk rose tea eases fever. 

Everyone in Meereen knows that. 

Especially the slaves 

who have to make the tea. 

If you want them to follow you  

you have to become 

a part of their world. 

Strategy. 

Harpy s Gold. 

No tea from this one. 

Beautiful but poisonous. 

You are a gambler  aren t you  

Your Grace. 

There s one on every mile marker 

between here and Meereen. 

How many miles are there 

between here and Meereen  

  Your Grace. 

 i I ll tell our men to ride  i  

 i ahead and bury them.  i  

You don t need to see this. 

You will do no such thing. 

I will see each 

and every one of their faces. 

Remove her collar 

before you bury her. 

 i There she is.  i  

Yes  there she is. 

  And  

  You made a promise. 

To return the Stark girls to 

their mother who is now dead. 

To keep them safe. 

Well  Arya Stark 

hasn t been seen 

since her father was killed. 

Where do you think she is  

My money s on dead. 

There s a certain safety 

in death  wouldn t you say  

And Sansa Stark is now 

Sansa Lannister. 

Bit of a complication. 

A complication does not 

release you from a vow. 

What do you want me to do  

Kidnap my sister in law  

And take her where  Where 

would she be safer than here  

Look me in the eye and tell me 

that you think she ll be 

safe in King s Landing. 

Are you sure we re not related  

Ever since I ve returned  

every Lannister I ve seen 

has been a miserable 

pain in my ass. 

Maybe you re a Lannister  too. 

You ve got the hair for 

it if not the looks. 

It s all right. 

It s all right. 

It s all right. 

  You re drunk. 

  Yes. 

I have good reason to be. 

Once I was a knight. 

Now I m only a fool. 

Don t you know me  

Ser Dontos. The king s 

nameday celebration. 

I m sorry. I should 

have remembered. 

I can t accept your apology. 

I may be a fool  but I m a 

living fool  thanks to you. 

Anyone would have 

done the same. 

But only you did. 

I can never repay you. 

You gave me my life. 

But this  

this is worth 

more than my life. 

It belonged to my mother 

and her mother before her. 

House Hollard was strong once. 

House on the rise. 

That s all that s left 

of those days  

thanks to a few sad  

fat drunks like me. 

I can t take it. 

It s very  very kind 

of you  but I can t. 

I don t have 

anything else left. 

That s all. 

Take it. 

Wear it. 

Let my name have one 

more moment in the sun 

before it disappears 

from the world. 

I ll wear it with pride  

Ser Dontos. 

Yeah. 

 i When am I going to get  i  

 i a horse of my own   i  

The little lady wants a pony. 

The little lady wants 

away from your stench. 

Horses aren t easy to come by. 

Even if they were  you think I m 

gonna put you on your own horse  

Watch the only thing of value 

I ve got in the world ride away  

Why don t you have any money  

Didn t you steal anything 

from Joffrey before you left  

No. 

You re not very smart  are you  

I m not a thief. 

You re fine with 

murdering little boys  

but thieving is beneath you  

A man s got to have a code. 

You think I m gonna escape  

Where would I go  

I d be dead by nightfall 

without you. 

My family s gone. 

I ve got no one. 

You ve got an aunt in the Vale. 

Your rich Aunt Lysa. 

After I sell you to her  

maybe she ll have 

enough left over 

to buy you that pony 

you want so much. 

 i   I m hungry.  i  

 i   You re hungry.  i  

Five horses  five men. 

More than I feel like 

killing on an empty stomach. 

I know him. 

 i The small one.  i  

 i His name is Polliver.  i  

He captured us 

and took us to Harrenhal. 

He killed Lommy. 

What the fuck s a Lommy  

He was my friend. 

Polliver stole my sword and put 

it right through his neck. 

He s still got it. 

 i Got what   i  

My sword Needle. 

Needle  Of course you 

named your sword. 

Lots of people 

name their swords. 

Lots of cunts. 

What are you... 

get back here. 

My brother gave me that sword. 

  Get back here. 

  He killed my friend. 

I don t care 

if he ate your friend. 

We re not going in there. 

 i Come on  give it up.  i  

Come here. 

  Let s have a feel there. 

  Leave it. 

Come here. 

Please  she s a good girl. 

Shut your mouth 

and pour us more ale 

and we may not take her with 

us when we re done with her. 

I know you. 

You re the Hound. 

 i Pour our new friend some ale.  i  

What brings you so far north  

I could ask the same of you. 

What are you doing up here  

Just keeping the king s peace. 

No need. 

The war s over. 

So I ve heard. Stannis 

defeated at the Blackwater. 

Robb Stark killed at the Twins. 

And where am I for all of it  

Stuck with your brother. 

  Meaning no offense. 

  None taken. 

He s good  the Mountain is. 

Best at what he does. 

But torture  torture  

torture  torture. 

 i You spend enough time putting 

the hammer to people   i  

 i you start to feel like  i  

 i a carpenter making chairs.  i  

Drains the fun right out of it. 

And what s life 

without a little fun  

But I don t need 

to tell you that  eh  

She s all right. 

I ve had better. 

You know what  

You should come with us. 

His kind  they ve always got 

something hidden away somewhere. 

Gold  silver  more daughters. 

 i Always something if you  i  

 i know how to make them talk.  i  

And there s plenty of him between 

here and King s Landing. 

You could do well for yourself. 

We certainly have been. 

I m not going 

to King s Landing. 

Think about it. We could 

do whatever we like 

wherever we go. 

These are the king s colors. 

No one s standing 

in his way now. 

Which means no one s 

standing in ours. 

Fuck the king. 

When I heard that Joffrey s 

dog had tucked tail 

and run from the Battle 

of the Blackwater  

I didn t believe it. 

  But here you are. 

  Here I am. 

Bring me one of those chickens. 

  You got money to pay for it  

  You paid for it  

No. 

But we re the king s men. 

So  you got money  

Not a penny. 

I ll still take that chicken. 

Tell you what. 

We ll trade you. 

One of our little chickens 

for one of yours. 

 i Give us a go at your friend.  i  

Lowell there likes them 

a bit broken in. 

You re a talker. 

Listening to talkers 

makes me thirsty. 

Ah. 

And hungry. 

Think I ll take two chickens. 

You don t seem to 

understand the situation. 

I understand that 

if any more words 

come pouring out 

of your cunt mouth  

I m gonna have to eat every 

fucking chicken in this room. 

You lived your life 

for the king. 

You re gonna die 

for some chickens  

Someone is. 

Something wrong 

with your leg  boy  

What  

What do you mean  

Can you walk  

I ve got to carry you  

Carry me  

Fine little blade. 

Maybe I ll pick 

my teeth with it. 

 cawing 

 i  dog barking   i 

    You   re wearing a black cloak again.

    I   ve been sent to negotiate with you.

    It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.

    It   s happened before.

    I was hoping your loyalty was real when

you pledged yourself to us  Jon Snow.

    Truly I was.

    The Halfhand ordered me to join your army

    and bring back whatever information

I could to Castle Black.

    He made me kill him so you   d trust me.

    I was loyal   

    to him and to my Night   s Watch vows.

    All your vows 

    She wasn   t enough to turn you  eh 

    Were you enough to turn her 

    She put three arrows in me

    when I escaped.

    Did you see her again at Castle Black 

    Yes.

    And 

    She   s dead.

    Your doing 

    No.

    We   ll drink to her.

    Of all the ways I   d kill you 

    poison would be the last.

    Ygritte.

    Ygritte.

     coughs 

    That   s not wine.

    No  it   s a proper northern drink  Jon Snow.

    You did well. Fought hard.

    Killed some of our strongest men.

    One of our giants went into your tunnel

    and never came out again.

    Mag the Mighty.

    He   s dead.

    He killed my friend Grenn.

    He was their king.

    The last of a bloodline that stretches back

    before the First Men.

    Grenn came from a farm.

    Mag and Grenn.

    Grenn and Mag.

    Kullback  could I trouble you for something to eat 

    I don   t imagine our guest has eaten anything

    for quite some time.

    So  you   re here to strike a bargain 

    Turn your army around and go home.

    You know I know you   re low on arrows 

    you   re low on oil  you   re low on men.

    How many are left   

    I told Tormund and Orell.

    We have more than   men.

    I showed you everything I had.

    The whole army    strong.

    And what did you do  You fired

on us with everything you had.

    It wasn   t much. As soon as I saw that 

    I sent  men to climb the Wall 

    an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

    A lot of them will die climbing 

    but most of them will be over by the end of the day.

     i It   s me being honest with you  Jon Snow   i 

     i which is more than you   ve ever done for me.  i 

    My people have bled enough.

    We   re not here to conquer.

    We   re here to hide behind your Wall.

    Just like you. We need your tunnel.

    Now we both know that winter is coming.

    And if my people aren   t south of

the Wall when it comes in earnest 

    we   ll all end up worse than dead.

    You want to strike a bargain with me 

    Here   s the bargain.

    You go back  you open the gates to us 

    and I swear to you that no one else will die.

    Refuse 

    and we   ll kill every last man at Castle Black.

    Ah 

    Oh  that   s why you   re here.

    I reckon you could do it before

any of them could stop you.

    They   d kill you  of course.

    They   d kill you slow.

    But you knew that when you came in here.

    Are you capable of that  Jon Snow 

    Killing a man in his own tent

when he   s just offered you peace 

    Is that what the Night   s Watch is 

    Is that what you are 

     i   horn blows   i 

    Man  i  Riders coming   i 

    Are you attacking us 

    No.

    It   s like you said  we don   t have the men.

     i   horn blowing   i 

     i   dogs barking   i

    and I meant it.

Man       i Round them up.  i 

     i Stay with the horses.  i 

    You   re the King beyond the Wall 

    Do you know who I am 

    Never had the pleasure.

    This is Stannis Baratheon 

    the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

    We   re not in the Seven Kingdoms and

you   re not dressed for this weather.

    It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

    We do not kneel.

    I   ll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall 

    have nowhere to put them  have nothing to feed them.

    I   m not here to slaughter beat dogs.

    Their fate depends on their king.

    All the same  we do not kneel.

    Take these men away.

    What   s a man of the Night   s

Watch doing in a wildling camp 

    I was sent to discuss terms

with the King beyond the Wall.

    You   re speaking to the one true king  boy.

    You will address him as Your Grace.

    I know he   s the king. My father died for him.

    My name is Jon Snow  Your Grace.

    I   m Ned Stark   s son.

    Your father was an honorable man.

    He was  Your Grace.

    What do you think he   d have done with him 

    I was this man   s prisoner once.

    He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.

     i But he spared my life.  i 

    I think my father would have taken him prisoner 

    listened to what he had to say.

    Very well  then. Take him.

    Your Grace.

     i If my father had seen the things that I   ve seen   i 

    he   d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.

    All of them.

 i  flies buzzing   i 

    I would suggest milk of the poppy

    to ease his pain  but he is completely insensate.

    Bloody Martells.

    The cause appears to be manticore venom.

    It is. The Death   s Head manticore.

    Yes  I   ve read a great deal about it.

    It   s a horrible poison.

    Usually Mantari in origin.

    Oh  Yes  yes.

    There   s nothing to be done.

    Yes  there is.

    May I ask what you think you   re doing 

    Saving him.

    Your Grace  I wish it were otherwise 

    but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

    Well  well beyond.

    This man is not even a maester 

    let alone Grand Maester.

    That   s for the best.

    No maester knows how to save him.

    That is exactly the sort of arrogance

    that had him expelled from the Citadel  Your Grace.

    His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.

    Rightly so  in my opinion.

    You   re dismissed  Grand Maester.

    But  Your Grace  this is my laboratory.

    Not anymore.

Pycelle       i But I     i 

 scoffs 

 i  door opens   i 

    You can save him 

    Difficult to say  Your Grace.

     i But if my past work is any guide     i 

 i  door slams   i 

       we stand a chance.

    Do everything you can.

    Come to me for anything you need.

    Thank you  Your Grace.

     i You should know   i 

    the process may change him   

    somewhat.

    Will it weaken him 

    Oh  no.

    Very well  then.

Tywin       i Not another word.  i 

    We   ve been over this. The matter   s closed.

    I   m opening it again.

    You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

    You   re still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

    And you will marry Loras Tyrell

    as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

    I will not.

    Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

    Tyrion   s sentence will be carried out tomorrow.

    You have on several occasions made great claims

    about your commitment to this family   s future.

    Your role in that future

    is more vital now than it ever was.

    I don   t care.

    I will stay in King   s Landing where

I belong with my son the king.

    When you were nine years old 

I was called to the capital.

    I decided to take your

brother with me and not you.

    You insisted that you would

not be left at Casterly Rock

    under any circumstances. And if you recall   

    I   m not interested in hearing

another one of your smug stories

    about the time you won.

    This isn   t going to be one of those times.

    Do you think you   ll be the first person

    dragged into a sept to be married against her will 

    When you marched into the throne room to tell me

    we   d won the Battle of Blackwater    Do you remember 

    I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

    I was about to give him essence of nightshade.

    That   s how far I was willing to go when I thought

    someone awful had come to take my son away.

    Someone awful is coming to take him away.

    No.

    Joffrey is dead.

    Myrcella   s been sold like livestock.

    And now you want to ship me off

to Highgarden and steal my boy.

    My last boy.

    Margaery will dig her claws in 

    you will dig your claws in

and you   ll fight over him

    like beasts until you rip him apart.

    I will burn our house to the

ground before I let that happen.

    And how will you do that 

    I   ll tell everyone the truth.

     i What truth would that be   i 

    You don   t know  do you 

    You never believed it.

    How is that possible 

    What am I saying  Of course it   s possible.

    How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family

    have any conception what his actual family was doing 

    We were right there in front

of you and you didn   t see us.

    One look in the past  years 

    one real look at your own children

and you would have known.

    Known what 

    Everything they say is true.

    About Jaime and me.

    No.

    Your legacy is a lie.

    No  no  no  no.

    I don   t believe you.

    Yes  you do.

    Jaime.

    You won.

    One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.

    There   s really nothing you wouldn   t do  is there 

    For my family  no  nothing.

    I would do things for my

family you couldn   t imagine.

    Tyrion is your family.

    He   s not.

    You don   t get to choose.

    I do. So do you.

    You can choose the creature that killed

our mother to come into this world   

    Are you really mad enough to blame him for that 

     i He didn   t decide to kill her. He was an infant.  i 

    A disease doesn   t decide to kill you.

    All the same  you cut it out before it does.

    What do you decide  What do you choose 

    The things I did to get back to you 

    to endure all that  only to find you   

    I choose you.

    Those are words.

    Yes.

    Like the ones I just said to Father.

    I told him.

    Told him what 

    I told him about us.

    You told him 

    I told him I won   t marry Loras Tyrell.

    I told him I   m staying right here

with Tommen  with you.

    You think he   ll just accept that 

    Go and ask him.

    What did you say 

    I don   t want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

    I don   t choose Tywin Lannister.

    I don   t love Tywin Lannister.

    I love my brother.

    I love my lover.

    People will whisper  they   ll make their jokes.

    Let them.

    They   re all so small  I can   t even see them.

    I only see what matters.

    Someone will walk in.

    I don   t care.

    I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

    You speak it very well.

    Before you freed me  I belonged to Master Mighdal.

    I was tutor to his children.

     i I taught them languages and history.  i 

    They know a great deal about your family because of me.

     i Little Calla is only seven   i 

    but she admires you very much.

    I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

    What can I do for you 

    When you took the city  the children begged me

    not to leave the house.

    But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

    So I lost my home.

    Now I live on the streets.

    I have outfitted mess halls

    to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

    I do not mean to offend  Your Grace.

     i I went to one of these places.  i 

    The young prey on the old.

    Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

    My Unsullied will make them

safe again in short order 

    my friend  this I promise you.

    Even if they are safe  who would I be there 

    What purpose would I serve 

     i With my master  I was a teacher.  i 

    I had the respect and love of his children.

    What is it that you want from me 

    Your Grace  I ask you

    to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

    You want to return to a man who owned you

    like a goat or a chair 

    Please  Your Grace.

    The young may rejoice in the new

world you have built for them 

    but for those of us too old to change 

    there is only fear and squalor.

    I am not alone.

    There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.

    I did not take this city to preside

    over the injustice I fought to destroy.

    I took it to bring people freedom.

    But freedom means making your own choices.

    I will allow you to sign a

contract with your former master.

    It may not cover a period

lasting longer than a year.

    Thank you  Your Grace.

    Thank you.

    The masters will take advantage of this situation.

    The men serving them

    will be slaves in all but name.

    Approach  my friend.

    He   s sworn to treat all wounded men  friend or foe.

    You want me alive so you can torture me 

    No one   s gonna torture you.

    So how do we die  Hanging  Beheading 

     i Drop us from the top of the Wall   i 

    I don   t know what happens to the prisoners.

    Who decides 

    I suppose Stannis does.

    He your king now 

    I don   t have a king.

    You spent too much time with us  Jon Snow.

    You can never be a kneeler again.

    We   re gonna burn the bodies of your dead.

    Do you want to say any words over them 

    Words  What kind of words 

    Funeral words. I don   t know how the free folk do it.

     i Do what   i 

    Say farewell.

    The dead can   t hear us  boy.

    Snow.

    Did you love her 

    She loved you.

    She told you 

     i No.  i 

    All she ever talked about was killing you.

     i That   s how I know.  i 

    She belongs in the North.

     i The real North.  i 

    You understand me 

 i  wind howling   i 

 groaning 

    We can stop. We can rest.

    We   ll rest with the three eyed raven.

    We   re not going to make it.

    We   re already here.

Bran       i Jojen.  i

Girl       i  Come with me  Brandon Stark.  i

    He is lost.

    Come with me or die with him.

     i They cannot follow us.  i 

    The power that moves them is powerless here.

    The First Men called us the children 

    but we were born long before them.

    Come  he waits for you.

     i  crow caws   i 

     caws 

    You   re the three eyed raven 

    I   ve been many things.

    Now I am what you see.

    My brother  he led us to you and now he   

    He knew what would happen.

    From the moment he left 

    he knew and he went anyway.

    How do you know 

    I   ve been watching you.

    All of you.

    All of your lives.

    With   eyes and one.

     i Now you   ve come to me at last   i 

    Brandon Stark.

    Though the hour is late.

    I didn   t want anyone to die for me.

    He died so you could find what you have lost.

    You   re going to help me walk again 

     i You will never walk again.  i 

    But you will fly.

     i  bird squawks   i 

    Podrick.

    Podrick.

    Where are the horses 

    I hobbled them last night.

    What sort of hobble 

    A figure eight like you taught me.

    If you did it like I taught you 

    then the horses would be here.

    Thieves  maybe 

    It   s at least  miles to the Eyrie from here.

    You   re carrying the saddlebags.

     i  grunting   i 

    People coming.

    You can shit later. There   s people coming.

    Morning.

    Morning.

    I like your sword.

     i Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate   i 

    About  more miles.

    Did you hear that  Podrick 

    Only  more miles to the Bloody Gate.

    Are you a knight 

    No.

    But you know how to use that sword 

    I do.

    Does it have a name 

    Oathkeeper.

    Mine   s Needle.

    Good name.

    Who taught you how to fight 

    My father.

    Mine never wanted to.

    Said fighting was for boys.

    Mine said the same.

    But I kept fighting the boys anyway.

     i Kept losing.  i 

    Finally my father said    If you   re going to do it 

    you might as well

do it right.  

    Seven blessings.

    I   m Brienne of Tarth. This is Podrick Payne.

    You want something 

    That   s Sandor Clegane. The Hound.

    You   re Arya Stark.

    I asked if you wanted something.

    I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.

    My mother   s dead.

     i I know.  i 

    I wish I could have been there to protect her.

    You   re not a northerner.

    No  but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

    Why didn   t you 

    She commanded me to bring Jaime

Lannister back to King   s Landing.

    You   re paid by the Lannisters.

     i You   re here for the bounty on me.  i 

    I   m not paid by the Lannisters.

    No 

    Fancy sword you   ve got there.

    Where   d you get it 

    I   ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life.

    Go on  Brienne of fucking Tarth.

    Tell me that   s not Lannister gold.

    Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

    The Bloody Gate is  miles.

    I swore to your mother by the old gods   

    I don   t care what you swore.

    Arya 

Hound       i You heard the girl.  i 

    She   s not coming with you.

    She is.

    You   re not a good listener.

    That Valyrian steel 

    I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

    Come with me  Arya. I   ll take you to safety.

    Safety  Where the fuck   s that 

    Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead. Her mother   s dead.

    Her father   s dead. Her brother   s dead.

    Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

    There is no safety  you dumb bitch.

    You don   t know that by now 

    you   re the wrong one to watch over her.

    And that   s what you   re doing 

    Watching over her 

    Aye  that   s what I   m doing.

    I   m ready.

    Go on  girl.

    Another name off your list.

    You kept promising me.

    I cut down your butcher   s boy.

    The ginger.

    He was begging for mercy.

      Please  Ser. Please don   t kill me.

    Please  please.

    And your sister.

    Your pretty sister.

     i I should have taken her.  i

    I should have fucked her bloody.

     i At least I   d have one happy memory.  i 

    Do I have to beg you 

    Do it.

    Do it.

    Do it.

    Kill me.

    Is that any way to speak about our mother 

    What are you doing 

    What do you think I   m doing 

    A galley   s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.

    Who   s helping you 

    Varys.

    Varys 

    You have more friends than you thought.

    There   s a locked door at the top of the stairs.

    Knock on it twice  then twice again.

    Varys will open.

    I suppose this is good bye  then.

    Farewell  little brother.

    Jaime.

    Thank you for my life.

    Quickly now.

    I   m sorry.

     door creaks 

    Tyrion.

    Put down the crossbow.

    Who released you 

    Your brother  I expect.

    He always had a soft spot for you.

    Come  we   ll go and talk in my chambers.

    This is how you want to speak to me  hmm 

     i Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.  i 

    All my life

    you   ve wanted me dead.

    Yes.

     i But you refused to die.  i 

    I respect that.

    Even admire it.

     i You fight for what   s yours.  i 

    I   d never let them execute you.

    Is that what you fear 

     i I   ll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.  i 

    You   re a Lannister.

    You   re my son.

    I loved her.

    Who 

    Shae.

    Oh  Tyrion.

    Put down that crossbow.

    I murdered her.

    With my own hands.

    It doesn   t matter.

    Doesn   t matter 

    She was a whore.

    Say that word again   

     i And what   i 

    You   ll kill your own father in the privy 

    No.

    You   re my son.

    Now  enough of this nonsense.

    I am your son and you sentenced me to die.

    You knew I didn   t poison Joffrey 

    but you sentenced me all the same.

    Why 

    Enough.

     i We   ll go back to my chambers  i 

    and speak with some dignity.

    I can   t go back there. She   s in there.

    You   re afraid of a dead whore 

     groans 

    You shot me.

     groans 

    You   re no son of mine.

    I am your son.

    I have always been your son.

     groans 

    What have you done 

    Quickly.

    Trust me  my friend. I brought you this far.

     i  bells tolling   i 

    I want to see the captain.

    You   re seeing him.

    I want to go north to the Wall.

    No  you don   t.

    I can pay.

    There is nothing in the North

but ice and war and pirates.

    I wouldn   t need a cabin. Please.

    I could work scrubbing the floors.

    I   m not going north  child. I   m going home.

    Where   s home 

    The Free City of Braavos.

    Wait. I have something else.

    More silver won   t make a difference.

    It   s not silver. It   s iron.

    This   

    How did you   

     i Valar morghulis.  i 

     i Valar dohaeris.  i 

    Of course  you shall have a cabin.

You ve got too much 

wood in there. 

But the more wood  

the bigger the fire. 

It needs to breathe. 

 i Take off that big log.  i  

Huh. 

You know your fires. 

Someone built your fires 

for you growing up  

It doesn t get so cold 

down in the Reach. 

And there were 

servants  of course. 

I knew you were highborn. 

Oh  I found something 

at the Fist of the First Men. 

Buried treasure. 

Thousands of years old. 

I think. 

What does it do  

I m not sure 

that it does anything. 

It s beautiful  though  

isn t it  

  How much longer  

  Not so far. 

A few more days. 

Is the Wall 

as big as they say  

Bigger. 

So big you can t even see 

the top sometimes. 

It s hidden in clouds. 

You re playing with me. 

I m not. 

It s  feet high  

all made of ice. 

On a warm day 

you can see it weeping. 

Castle Black 

is nice enough. 

They keep a fire burning 

in the long hall 

day and night. 

And Hobb makes 

venison stew 

with onions. 

Very tasty. 

Sometimes  one of 

the brothers will sing. 

Dareon sings best. 

  Do you sing  

  No. 

No  no  no. 

Not very well. 

Sing me a song. 

Oh  all right. 

Let s see. 

Oh... ahem. 

    The father s face 

is stern and strong     

    He sits and judges 

right from wrong     

    He weighs our lives  

the short and long     

    And loves 

the little children     

 i     The mother gives 

the gift of life      i  

    And watches over 

every wife     

    Her gentle smile 

ends all strife     

    And she loves 

her little children.     

That s not how 

you skin a rabbit. 

I know how 

to skin a rabbit. 

Not by the looks of it. 

You grow up 

north of the Wall  

you learn the proper 

way to handle game. 

I didn t see any game 

before I got here. 

If I had a bow  I could have shot 

a dozen rabbits. 

Well  I made 

this bow myself. 

Guess you don t learn 

how to do that north of the Wall. 

You learn how to use 

your fists  though. 

Oh  you re gonna punch 

the rabbits to death  

I had someone else in mind. 

Well  someone else 

is sitting right here. 

You re both very good 

at skinning rabbits. 

Some of us are just 

a little better. 

Well  some of us would say 

thank you when someone else 

hunts down their 

breakfast for them. 

Or don t they teach you to say 

thank you north of the Wall  

You ve got a big mouth  girl  

and too many teeth. 

  Stop it  

  Hodor. 

You ve been fighting since you met. 

Just stop it. 

Lady Reed here s got 

a stick so far up her ass  

it s a wonder her feet 

touch the ground. 

You ve been nasty 

to her every day. 

Of course she s nasty back. 

Me  It s my fault  

First time I met her  

she put a knife to my throat. 

First time I met you  

you held a knife at me. 

We can t fight each other. 

We ll never make it 

to the Wall. 

I want you both 

to make peace. 

Your way of skinning rabbits 

is quicker than mine. 

  I said so  didn t I  

  Osha  

You re a good 

little hunter. 

Thank you. 

See  

Not so hard  is it  

Thank you. 

Don t push me. 

Shh. 

I m right here with you. 

What s happening  

I m right here with you. 

What s wrong with him  

The visions 

take their toll. 

He s having one now  

I saw Jon Snow. 

You saw him  

At Castle Black  

He was on the wrong side 

of the Wall... 

surrounded by enemies. 

Used to be you couldn t 

find a tree within a mile of the Wall. 

Crows would come out 

every morning with axes. 

Your flock gets smaller 

every year. 

You ever climbed it before  

No. 

But Tormund s done it 

half a hundred times. 

You re afraid. 

 i   Aren t you  

  Aye.  i  

It s a long way up 

and a long way down. 

But I ve waited 

my whole life 

to see the world 

from up there. 

Here  sit down. 

I brought a pair for you. 

They re too big for you  

but they re good. 

You kill someone 

for them  

Nah. 

 i I didn t kill him   i  

but I bet his balls 

are still bruised. 

He wasn t good to me 

the way you re good to me. 

He didn t do that thing 

you do with your tongue. 

Can we not talk 

about that here  

 Can we not talk 

about that here  

I m Jon Snow. 

I ve killed dead men 

and Qhorin Halfhand  

but I m scared 

of naked girls.  

Did I seem scared 

the other day  

You were trembling 

like a leaf. 

Only in the beginning. 

Only in the beginning. 

You re a proper lover  

Jon Snow. 

And don t worry. 

Your secret s safe 

with me. 

What secret  

Do you think I m as dumb 

as all those girls 

in silk dresses 

you knew growing up  

You re loyal 

and you re brave. 

You didn t stop 

being a crow 

the day you walked 

into Mance Rayder s tent. 

But I m your woman now  

Jon Snow. 

You re going to be loyal 

to your woman. 

The Night s Watch 

don t care if you live or die. 

Mance Rayder don t care 

if I live or die. 

We re just soldiers 

in their armies 

and there s plenty more 

to carry on if we go down. 

It s you and me 

that matters 

to me and you. 

Don t ever betray me. 

I won t. 

 Cause I ll cut 

your pretty cock right off 

and wear it 

 round my neck. 

Sink your metal deep 

and make sure it holds 

before taking your next step. 

And if you fall  

don t scream. 

You don t want that to be the 

last thing she remembers. 

 i Joffrey.  i  

Cersei. 

 i Ilyn Payne.  i  

You re good. 

You re not as good 

as you think you are. 

Face  tits  balls   

I hit  em right 

where I wanted to. 

Aye  but you took 

your sweet time of it. 

You won t be fighting 

straw men  little lady. 

Show me your position. 

Keep your elbow high. 

You want your back 

doing the hard labor. 

You re holding. 

Never hold. 

  What  

  Your muscles tense up when you hold. 

Pull the string back 

to the center of your chin 

and release. 

Never hold. 

But I have to aim. 

Never aim. 

Never aim  

Your eye knows where 

it wants the arrow to go. 

Trust your eye. 

There s someone out there. 

That s about far enough. 

We come as friends. 

 i Begging 

your pardon  m lady   i  

but we ll be 

the judge of that. 

Valar morghulis. 

 i Valar dohaeris.  i  

My friends here 

don t speak High Valyrian. 

 i Why are you here  

my lady   i  

Forgive my manners. 

I don t see many ladies 

these days. 

Lucky for the ladies. 

How many times has 

the Lord brought him back  

Six. 

I ve always been 

a terrible priest. 

Drank too much rum. 

Fucked all the whores 

in King s Landing. 

It s a terrible 

thing to say  

but by the time I came 

to Westeros  I didn t believe in our Lord. 

I decided that He  

that all the gods  

 i were stories we told 

the children to make them behave.  i  

So I wore the robes and every now 

and then I d recite the prayers  

but it was just for show. 

A spectacle 

for the locals. 

Until the Mountain drove a lance 

through this one s heart. 

I knelt beside 

his cold body 

and said the old words. 

Not because I believed 

in them  but... 

he was my friend 

and he was dead. 

And they were 

the only words I knew. 

And for the first time 

in my life  the Lord replied. 

Beric s eyes opened 

 i and I knew the truth.  i  

Our god 

is the one true god. 

And all men 

must serve Him. 

You ve been 

to the other side. 

The other side  

There is no other side. 

I have been 

to the darkness  my lady. 

He sent you to us 

for a reason. 

You have someone 

He needs. 

Bodkin point. 

Penetrates plate 

at  yards. 

Can you make  em  

Yeah  nothing tricky 

about it. 

Just need decent steel. 

I ll get you the steel. 

 i Come on.  i  

 i I don t like that woman.  i  

That s  cause 

you re a girl. 

What does that have 

to do with anything  

Forgive me  lad. 

What are you doing  

Let go of him. 

  Tell them to stop. 

  Come on. 

He wants to be one of you. 

He wants to join the Brotherhood. 

Stop them  

We serve 

the Lord of Light 

and the Lord of Light 

needs this boy. 

Did the Lord of Light 

tell you that or did she  

You re not doing this 

for your god. 

You re doing it for gold. 

We re doing it 

for both  girl. 

We can t defend the people 

without weapons 

and horses and food. 

And we can t get weapons 

and horses and food without gold. 

You told me 

this was a Brotherhood. 

You told me 

I could be one of you. 

You are more 

than they can ever be. 

They re just foot soldiers 

in the great war. 

You will make kings 

rise and fall. 

You re a witch. 

You re going to hurt him. 

I see a darkness in you. 

And in that darkness  

eyes staring back at me   

brown eyes  

blue eyes  

green eyes. 

Eyes you ll shut forever. 

We will meet again. 

You staring at my ass  

Jon Snow  

You all right  

Just seeing if you can 

take a hit  lad. 

Sorry. 

Were you sleeping  

Wa   

Wa    Wa    

Water  

You want some water. 

I wish I had 

some for you. 

So let s play a game. 

Which body part 

do you need the least  

  Please. 

  Please is not a body part. 

I ll tell you everything  

please. 

But you ve already 

told me everything. 

 i Remember   i  

Your daddy 

was mean to you. 

The Starks didn t 

appreciate you. 

One good bit  though. 

The Stark boys  

they re still alive. 

Wouldn t that be 

a hunt to remember  

You failed  but I m a better 

hunter than you. 

 i Now...  i  

how about 

your little finger  

You don t use that 

for much  do you  

No  Good. 

Let s start with that. 

You ve been wondering 

why you re here. 

 i Haven t you   i  

 i Where you are.  i  

Who I am. 

Why I m doing 

this to you. 

So guess. 

 i If you guess right   i  

I ll tell you. 

By the old gods 

and the new  I swear it. 

You win the game 

if you can 

figure out who I am 

and why 

I m torturing you 

and I win the game if you beg 

me to cut off your finger. 

If I win  

you ll let me go  

If you think this has 

a happy ending  

you haven t been 

paying attention. 

Please. 

You say please again 

and you ll wish you hadn t. 

You first. 

Where are we  

  The North. 

  Too vague. 

Deepwood Motte. 

Terrible guess. 

Now  where  

Last Hearth. 

Do I look like 

a fucking Umber to you  

Karhold  

Karhold  

How did you know that  

Did you see any banners 

flying when we came in  

No. 

It was just a guess. 

Very good  Lord Theon. 

And who am I  

Torrhen Karstark. 

He s dead. 

Strangled by 

the Kingslayer. 

He was your brother. 

Your father 

is Lord Rickard Karstark. 

  You swore to tell me if I   

  You re right. 

Lord Rickard Karstark 

is Robb Stark s bannerman. 

 i I betrayed Robb.  i  

That s why you re 

torturing me. 

Yes. 

You win. 

Of course  you forgot 

to ask one question. 

You forgot to ask 

if I m a liar. 

I m afraid I am. 

Everything I told you 

is a lie. 

This isn t happening 

to you for a reason. 

Well  one reason   

I enjoy it. 

Please  cut it off  

Cut it off  Cut it off  

I win. 

Thank you for riding 

here so quickly. 

I know travel 

isn t easy in these times. 

The roads are crawling 

with cutthroats and bandits. 

But when the King 

of the North summons us  we come. 

 i Our father has 

instructed us to tell you  i  

that his alliance 

with the North can continue 

if his terms are met. 

Lord Frey requires 

a formal apology 

for your violation 

of your sacred oath 

to marry one 

of his daughters. 

Of course. He deserves as much. 

I was in the wrong. 

As restitution 

for this betrayal  

 i he demands Harrenhal 

and all its attendant lands.  i  

  I don t think that s   

  We are fighting for the North. 

Harrenhal is not 

in the North. 

It is his 

once the war is over 

and we have no further 

strategic need for it. 

And there s 

something else. 

We will do whatever we can 

to give Lord Frey what he needs. 

Not what  whom. 

What  

No. 

Our father requires 

Lord Edmure to wed 

one of his daughters   

Roslin. 

How old is she  

. 

Could I see her first  

You want to count 

her teeth  

 i We depart for the Twins 

in the morning.  i  

 i We need an answer 

before we leave  i  

and a wedding not more 

than a fortnight thereafter 

or this alliance 

is at an end. 

Your father does realize 

we re in the middle of a war  

Father is old. 

It will put 

his heart at peace 

if he could see her wed 

to a good husband. 

And his recent experience 

has made him wary 

 i of long engagements.  i  

He has every right to be. 

Please excuse us 

while we discuss it. 

Why should I let that old 

ferret choose my bride for me  

At the very least  I should be 

offered the same choice you were. 

I m his liege lord. 

He s a proud man 

and we ve wounded him. 

I didn t wound him. 

My answer is no. 

Listen to me 

and listen very carefully. 

You   

The laws of gods and men 

are very clear. 

No man can compel 

another man to marry. 

The laws of my fist 

are about to compel your teeth. 

It s all right. 

You heard him. 

If you refuse  our alliance with 

the Freys is dead. 

He s wanted me for one 

of his daughters since I was . 

He s not gonna stop 

wanting it now. 

When I say no  

he will come back 

and offer me a daughter 

of my choosing. 

You re willing to risk 

our freedom 

and our lives for a chance 

at a prettier wife  

I have a war to fight. 

We can t win it 

without them. 

I have no time to haggle. 

You said you wanted to make 

amends for the Stone Mill. 

You recall that 

heroic engagement  

I had something 

less permanent in mind. 

I ve won every battle  

but I m losing this war. 

If we don t do this 

and do it now  

we re lost. 

I ll marry her. 

You re paying 

for my sins  Uncle. 

It s not fair or right. 

I ll remember it. 

 i I see my men have 

finally found you  i  

 i something appropriate 

to wear.  i  

Yes. Most kind of them. 

You re a Stark 

bannerman  Lord Bolton. 

I am acting on 

Lady Stark s orders 

 i to return Jaime Lannister 

to King s Landing.  i  

When King Robb left Harrenhal  

his mother was his prisoner. 

If she wasn t his mother  

 i he d have hanged her 

for treason.  i  

I should send you 

back to Robb Stark. 

You should. 

But instead  

you re sitting here 

watching me fail at dinner. 

Why might that be  

Wars cost money. 

Many people would pay 

a great deal for you. 

We both know 

who would pay the most. 

 i Or make you pay the most  i  

if he found out 

you had captured me 

and sent me back up north 

for a summary execution. 

You re right. 

Perhaps the safest thing to do is to 

kill you both and burn your bodies. 

It would be  

if you honestly believed my father 

would never find out about it. 

King Robb is keeping 

your father quite busy. 

He doesn t have time 

for anything else. 

He ll make time for you. 

As soon as you re 

well enough to travel  

 i I will allow you 

to go to King s Landing  i  

as restitution for the mistakes 

my soldiers made. 

And you will swear to tell 

your father the truth  

that I had nothing 

to do with your maiming. 

  Shall we drink on it  

  I don t partake. 

You do understand how suspicious 

that is to ordinary people  

Very well. 

My lady  

may our journey continue 

without further incident. 

Oh  she won t be 

going with you. 

I am charged with 

bringing Ser Jaime to   

 i You are charged 

with abetting treason.  i  

I m afraid I must insist. 

 i You re in no place 

to insist on anything.  i  

I would have hoped 

you d learned your lesson 

about overplaying 

your position. 

 i   Impossible. 

  Why   i  

My grandson is the pride 

of Highgarden. 

 i The most desirable bachelor 

in all seven kingdoms.  i  

  Your daughter   

  Is rich  

the most beautiful woman 

in all seven kingdoms... 

and the mother 

of the king. 

Old. 

Old  

Old. 

 i I m something of an expert 

on the subject.  i  

 i Her change will be 

upon her before long.  i  

I ll spare you the details 

of what will happen then. 

You men may have a stomach 

for bloodshed and slaughter  

but this is another 

matter entirely. 

The years punish us as well  

I promise you that. 

My stomach remains 

quite strong  however. 

The only thing 

that might turn it 

are details of your grandson s 

nocturnal activities. 

 i   Do you deny them  

  Oh  not at all.  i  

A sword swallower 

through and through. 

And a boy 

with his affliction 

should be grateful 

for the opportunity 

 i to marry the most beautiful 

woman in the kingdoms  i  

and remove the stain 

from his name. 

Did you grow up 

with boy cousins  Lord Tywin  

Sons of your father s 

bannermen  

squires  stable boys  

Of course. 

And you never... 

No. 

Not once  

Not in any way  

Never. 

I congratulate you 

upon your restraint. 

But it s a natural thing  

two boys having a go 

at each other 

beneath the sheets. 

Perhaps Highgarden 

has a high tolerance 

for unnatural behavior. 

 i I wouldn t say that.  i  

True  we don t tie 

ourselves in knots 

over a discreet 

bit of buggery  but... 

brothers and sisters   

where I come from  

that stain 

would be very difficult 

to wash out. 

I will not breathe 

further life 

into a malicious lie 

by discussing it. 

Lie or not  

you must admit many people 

find it quite convincing. 

Convincing enough 

to put swords in their hands 

and send them off 

to kill Lannisters 

and Tyrells thanks to 

our new affiliation. 

I don t care 

what people believe. 

And neither do you. 

As an authority on myself  

I must disagree. 

Now  if the rumors about 

my children were true  

then Joffrey 

is no king at all 

and House Tyrell is throwing its 

prized flower into the dirt. 

And if Cersei is too old 

to give Loras children  

we re throwing another 

prized flower into the dirt. 

It is a chance 

we simply cannot take. 

The uncertainty 

makes you uncomfortable. 

All right. 

I ll remove it for you. 

If you refuse to marry 

Loras to Cersei  

I will name him 

to the Kingsguard. 

 i I m sure you re familiar 

with the Kingsguard vows.  i  

He will never marry. 

  He will never have children. 

  Oh... 

 i The Tyrell name 

will fade.  i  

And Highgarden will go 

to the children 

of Joffrey 

and Margaery. 

You would have 

your grandson protected 

by someone 

who disgusts you  

I would have my grandson 

protected by a skilled warrior 

who takes his vows 

seriously. 

So  shall I draw up 

the order  

Or do you consent 

to this marriage  

It s a rare enough thing   

a man who lives up 

to his reputation. 

No  

We ve gotta cut them loose  

No  

Take my hand  

 i That s a wonderful pin.  i  

Oh  it s more 

of a brooch  really. 

Though I suppose a brooch 

is a sort of pin  so... 

I m very happy about... 

Uh  yes. 

I I am as well. 

I feel like 

I m in a dream. 

Yes  me  too. 

Definitely. 

I ve dreamed of a large wedding 

since I was quite young. 

The guests  

the food  

the tournaments. 

And the bride  

of course. 

The most beautiful bride 

in the world 

in a beautiful 

gown of gold 

and green brocade 

with fringed sleeves. 

Have you ever been 

to Highgarden  my lady  

No. I had never 

left Winterfell 

before I came 

to King s Landing. 

But it sounds wonderful. 

I can t wait to see it. 

And to leave this place. 

It s terrible  

isn t it  

The most terrible 

place there is. 

 i I don t suppose 

there s anything we can do about this.  i  

We can have them 

both killed. 

It s hard to say 

which of the four of us 

is getting the worst 

of this arrangement. 

Probably Sansa. 

Though Loras 

will certainly come to know 

a deep and singular misery. 

Father doesn t 

discriminate. 

We re all being shipped 

off to hell together. 

On a boat you built. 

The Tyrells were plotting 

to undermine our family. 

I did what I did 

to protect our family. 

I m your family. 

A member of your family 

who has actively contributed 

to that family s survival. 

Whether or not 

you or Father 

or anyone else 

wants to admit it. 

I do admit it. 

If it weren t for your trick 

with the wildfire  

Stannis would have sacked the 

city before Father got here. 

 i Our heads would still be 

rotting on the city gate.  i  

Trying to have me killed is an 

odd way of saying thank you. 

There are two people 

in King s Landing 

who can give an order 

to a Kingsguard. 

Did you or did you not 

order Ser Mandon 

 i to kill me during the Battle 

of the Blackwater   i  

The impulse I understand. 

He hates me 

because I m the only one 

who tells him 

what he really is. 

So  fair enough. 

He wants me dead. 

But his stupidity  

He could have had me poisoned 

and no one would have known. 

But the king 

orders a Kingsguard 

to murder 

the Hand of the King 

in full view 

of his own army. 

The boy s an idiot. 

What do you 

want me to say  

I want you to tell me if my life 

is still in danger. 

Probably. 

But not from Joffrey. 

He won t do anything 

now Father s here. 

Seven kingdoms 

united in fear 

of Tywin Lannister. 

Not the Tyrells. 

Soon they won t need 

to be afraid of him. 

Joffrey will belong 

to Margaery  

the little 

doe eyed whore. 

And so will his children 

and their children. 

History will be taken 

from our hands. 

You may escape  

at least. 

Once Jaime gets back  

Ser Loras may come down 

with a terrible case 

of sword through bowels. 

When Jaime gets back  yes. 

But when do we think 

that s going to be  

He s out there somewhere. 

Jaime or not  

I m truly fucked. 

Who s going to tell her  

Do you think 

people will like it  

I don t think they 

will even notice it. 

You re right. 

It s not my wedding. 

Anyway  from what 

I can tell  

the dressmakers in Highgarden 

will be far superior 

to the ones 

in King s Landing. 

They d never make me anything 

as dull as this for my wedding. 

Loras likes green 

and gold brocade. 

I m sure he does. 

Will they let me 

invite my family  

They haven t asked 

my opinion. 

But do you think 

they will  

No. 

Lady Sansa  

Lord Tyrion to see you. 

  Should I   

  I beg your pardon  my lady. 

Good afternoon  

Lord Tyrion. 

I was just trying on a gown 

for King Joffrey s wedding. 

Yes  it should be 

quite a wedding. 

I need to speak 

with you  Lady Sansa. 

Of course. 

Alone  if I may. 

Why do you need 

to speak to her alone  

Shae. 

Please excuse her  

Lord Tyrion. 

 i She s not from here.  i  

But I trust her  

even though 

she tells me not to. 

Sometimes we think 

we want to hear something 

 i and it s only afterwards 

when it s too late  i  

that we realize 

we wished we d heard it 

under entirely 

different circumstances. 

It s all right  really. 

How to begin  

It s   this   

this   this is awkward. 

  blades 

taken from the hands 

of Aegon s fallen enemies  

forged in the fiery breath 

of Balerion the Dread. 

There aren t 

  blades. 

There aren t even . 

I ve counted. 

Ha  I m sure you have. 

Ugly old thing. 

Yet it has 

a certain appeal. 

The Lysa Arryn 

of chairs. 

 i Shame you had to settle 

for your second choice.  i  

Early days  my friend. 

It is flattering  

really... 

you feeling such dread 

at the prospect of me 

getting what I want. 

Thwarting you has never 

been my primary ambition  

I promise you. 

Although who doesn t like to see 

their friends fail now and then  

You re so right. 

For instance  

when I thwarted 

your plan 

to give Sansa Stark 

to the Tyrells. 

If I m going 

to be honest  

I did feel 

an unmistakable sense 

of enjoyment there. 

But your confidant  

the one who fed you information 

about my plans  

the one you swore 

to protect... 

you didn t bring her 

any enjoyment. 

And she didn t bring me 

any enjoyment. 

She was a bad 

investment on my part. 

Luckily  I have a friend 

who wanted to try 

something new. 

Something daring. 

And he was so grateful 

to me for providing 

this fresh experience. 

I did what I did 

for the good of the realm. 

The realm  

Do you know 

what the realm is  

It s the thousand blades 

of Aegon s enemies. 

A story we agree to tell 

each other over and over 

till we forget 

that it s a lie. 

But what do we have left 

once we abandon the lie  

Chaos. 

A gaping pit waiting 

to swallow us all. 

Chaos isn t a pit. 

Chaos is a ladder. 

 i Many who try 

to climb it fail  i  

 i and never get 

to try again.  i  

 i The fall breaks them.  i  

 i And some are given 

a chance to climb   i  

 i but they refuse.  i  

 i They cling to the realm  i  

 i or the gods  i  

 i or love.  i  

 i Illusions.  i  

 i Only the ladder is real.  i  

 i The climb is all there is.  i

    You brought her down. That s what matters. 

A fine shot. 

Wasn t it  Reek  

A fine shot  master. 

My lady. 

Please  my lord. 

It hurts. 

Oh  sweet. 

Don t cry. 

It will be over soon. 

She thinks she s pretty. 

Let me put one through her face. 

We have to reward 

the hounds  love. 

They did all the hard work. 

Why  I did 

whatever you asked. 

But you made Myranda 

feel jealous. 

    Me jealous of her  

     i  My lord  please. 

You can see that your presence 

has become a bit of a problem.

Is it solid gold  

Gilded steel. 

You re not eating. 

Why is no one eating  

My wife wastes away and my 

brother starves himself. 

    I m not hungry. 

    You lost a hand  

not a stomach. 

Try the boar. 

Cersei can t get enough of it 

since one killed Robert for her. 

A toast. 

To the proud Lannister children. 

The dwarf  the cripple  

and the mother of madness. 

    Oh  

    I ll clean it up. 

No  I ll do it. 

Leave us. 

It s only wine. 

I can t fight anymore. 

What about your left  

I can hold a sword  but all 

my instincts are wrong. 

How can I protect the king 

when I can hardly 

wipe my own ass  

You re the Lord Commander now. 

Command. 

Let others do the fighting. 

When was the last time 

Father used a sword  

I m not Father. 

I m the Kingslayer. 

When people find out 

I can t slay a pigeon... 

Train  then. 

Learn to fight with your other hand. 

With whom  You  

Men talk. 

Soon as someone discovers I can t 

fight  he ll tell everyone. 

You need a proper  

discreet swordsman. 

As it happens  

I have just the one. 

My brother tells me you 

can keep your mouth shut. 

Unusual talent for a sellsword. 

He tells me you shit gold 

just like your father. 

Is this place safe  

There s this knight  Leygood  

    got thunderbolts on his shield. 

    Uh   huh. 

Right here is where 

I fuck his wife. 

She s a screamer  that one. 

If they don t hear her  

they won t hear us. 

  whistles   I ve never 

seen Valyrian steel before. 

She s a beauty. 

The problem is  

if you fight with 

an edged blade  

I ll have to. 

And if I fight with 

an edged blade  

I ll have no one left to pay me. 

  blade clatters   

I haven t used a sparring 

sword since I was nine. 

Ah  

Bold warrior you are  attacking 

a man when his guard s down. 

Best time to attack a man. 

Mind yourself. 

    If I still had my right hand... 

    Plan on growing it back  

Come on  then. 

Man  

 i Open the gates  

 i Riders coming in  

  horse whinnies   

Man       i Let s get these 

horses seen to  

Father. 

Welcome home. 

Walda  this is 

Ramsay Snow  my bastard. 

A pleasure  Mother. 

Hello. 

Roose       i See that the horses are 

fed  watered  and rubbed down. 

And take Lady Walda 

to her chambers. 

This way  my lady. 

Where is your prize  

With the hounds. 

I ll have a look at him. 

I hear you took a hand 

from the Kingslayer. 

Word travels. 

How he screamed. 

    You would have loved it. 

      laughs   

Father. 

What did you do to him  

I trained him. 

He was a slow learner  but he learned. 

You flayed him. 

Peeled a few bits. 

Removed a few others. 

This was Balon Greyjoy s 

son and heir. 

We ve been flaying 

our enemies for   years. 

The flayed man 

is on our banners. 

My banners  not yours. 

You re not a Bolton. 

You re a Snow. 

Tywin Lannister has given 

me the North. 

But he won t lift a finger 

to help me take it. 

As long as the ironborn 

hold Moat Cailin  

 i our armies are trapped  i  

 i south of the Neck. 

Theon was a valuable 

hostage  not your plaything. 

I wanted to trade him 

for Moat Cailin. 

I already asked. 

Lord Greyjoy refused. 

Savages have no    

You sent terms to Balon 

Greyjoy without my consent  

You made me acting 

Lord of the Dreadfort. 

I acted. 

I had to smuggle myself 

into my own lands 

thanks to the Greyjoys. 

I needed Theon. 

I needed him whole. 

Theon was our enemy. 

But Reek  

Reek will never betray us. 

I placed far too much 

trust in you. 

Reek  how could you let me stand 

before my father unshaven  

     i  It s disrespectful.  i  

    I m sorry  my lord. 

Give him the razor. 

If I m not a Bolton  

Father  what does it matter  

Go on  Reek. 

 i A nice close shave. 

Reek  tell Father 

where are Bran and Rickon Stark  

I don t know  my lord. 

You murdered them 

and displayed their corpses 

at Winterfell. 

Ramsay  i      Reek  

did you murder the Stark boys  

No  my lord. 

Just two farm boys. 

Ramsay       i And crisped them 

so no one would know. 

Theon  

 i Yes  my lord. 

The Starks have always 

ruled the North. 

If Bran and Rickon are alive  

the country will rally 

to their side 

now that Robb Stark is gone. 

 i Oh  that s right  Reek. 

Robb Stark is dead. 

 i Sorry. 

 i I know he was like  i  

 i a brother to you. 

But my father put a knife 

through his heart. 

How do you feel about that  

    You ready for a hunt  

    Always. 

Find those boys and I ll give 

you   acres and a holdfast. 

Your pet rat have any thoughts 

on which way they went 

after Winterfell  

Jon Snow is at Castle Black. 

Who the fuck is Jon Snow  

Their bastard brother. 

He could be sheltering them. 

He may know where they are. 

Even if he doesn t  

he s half Stark himself. 

Could be a threat. 

You want to prove 

yourself a Bolton  

Gather whatever men you can 

and ride for Moat Cailin. 

Bring this creature of yours. 

Maybe he ll be of some use. 

Take the Moat for the family  

for i  our  i  family  

and I ll reconsider 

your position. 

Lord Varys. 

Breakfasting with the king  

I m afraid foreigners aren t 

welcome at such exclusive affairs. 

    Oh  to be foreign. 

    Ahem. 

Shae has been noticed. 

Sansa s maid saw you with her. 

She already told your sister. 

It s only a matter of time 

before your father hears. 

So I m guilty of being seen 

with my own wife s handmaiden. 

My father will ask you 

if there s anything more 

and you ll tell him 

some clever lie. 

No  I will not. 

How long do you imagine your father 

and sister would let me live 

if they suspected me of lying  

I have no pet sellsword 

to protect me. 

No legendary brother 

to avenge me. 

 i Only little birds  i  

 i who whisper in my ear. 

Forgive me 

if I don t weep for you. 

No one weeps 

for spiders or whores. 

I have friends across 

the sea who could help her. 

She won t leave. 

I ve told her this is 

a dangerous place 

so many times  

she no longer believes it. 

Your father has promised to hang 

the next whore he finds you with. 

Have you ever known your 

father to make an idle threat  

From House Tyrell and the 

people of the Reach  

Your Grace  it is my honor to 

present you with this wedding cup. 

May you and my daughter Margaery 

drink deep and live long. 

A handsome goblet  my lord. 

Or shall I call you Father  

I shall be honored  Your Grace. 

She s the whore 

I told you about. 

The dark haired one. 

Have her brought to the Tower 

of the Hand before the wedding. 

A book  

  The Lives of Four Kings.   

Grand Maester Kaeth s history 

of the reigns of 

Daeron the Young Dragon  

Baelor the Blessed  Aegon the 

Unworthy  and Daeron the Good. 

A book every king should read. 

Now that the war is won  

we should all find 

time for wisdom. 

Thank you  Uncle. 

One of only two Valyrian 

steel swords in the capital  

Your Grace  freshly 

forged in your honor. 

Careful  Your Grace. 

Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel. 

So they say. 

  panting   

Such a great sword 

should have a name. 

    What shall I call her  

    Man  i  Stormbringer. 

    Man    i  Terminus.  i  

    Man    i  Widow s Wail. 

    Man    i  Wolfsbane.  i  

    Widow s Wail. I like that. 

  chuckles   

Every time I use it  

it ll be like cutting off 

Ned Stark s head all over again. 

 i   door opens   

Don t. 

You want me on the desk  

     i  What s wrong  my lion   i  

    Don t call me that. 

What should I call you  

I m afraid our friendship 

can t continue. 

Our friendship  

There s a ship waiting in 

the harbor bound for Pentos. 

What  

You ll have your own 

cabin  of course  

and across the Narrow Sea 

a house  servants. 

What is this  

I m a married man. 

My wife has suffered a great 

deal  as you well know. 

 i I don t want her to suffer 

anymore on my account. 

I need to uphold my vows. 

She doesn t want you. 

     i  I need to do right by her.  i  

    You don t want her. 

By our children. 

    What are you afraid of  

    I m not afraid. 

You are. You are afraid of 

your father and your sister. 

    You re going to run from them all your life  

    I need you to leave. 

I m not afraid of them. 

I m not going to run. 

    Shae. 

    We will fight them together. 

It s like you said  

I am yours and you are mine. 

You re a whore  

Sansa is fit to bear 

my children and you are not. 

I can t be in love with a whore. 

I can t have children 

with a whore. 

How many men have you been with  

How many whores 

have you been with  

I have enjoyed my time 

with all of them 

and I have enjoyed my time 

with you most of all. 

But now that time is over. 

 i   Shae crying   

You ll have a comfortable 

life in Pentos. 

Bronn will escort you 

to your ship. 

 i   door closes   

 i    woman screaming    i  

Melisandre      Hear us now. 

Accept these tokens 

of our faith  my lord  

and lead us from the darkness. 

  crying   

Sire  I served you well. 

 i   crowd chanting   Lord of 

Light  show us the way... 

Selyse  you re my sister  

Yours are the stars 

that guide us. 

Tell him  

Tell him  

Melisandre       i Lord of Light  protect us  

for the night is dark 

and full of terrors. 

  screaming   

Did you see  

Their souls. 

It was their souls. 

Our lord took them. 

Did you see  

Lord Florent was 

your brother by law. 

He was an infidel. 

He worshipped the gods 

of his fathers 

and their fathers before him. 

They were the gods 

of your fathers  too. 

I ordered him to tear 

down his idols. 

He disobeyed. 

How many ships did he 

bring to your cause  

How many men  

A good deal more than you. 

Did you see  Ser Davos  

They re with our lord now. 

Their sins all burned away. 

Did you see  

I m sure they re more 

than grateful  my queen. 

  sniffs   

Meat s off. 

Our larders are almost empty. 

Serve fish  then. 

We re on an island. 

You hate fish. 

I hate a good many things  

but I suffer them all the same. 

When Storm s End was under 

siege and I was starving  

 i Stannis boiled soup  i  

 i for me from books. 

The binding glue 

is made from horses. 

One morning  he shot two 

seagulls on the beach. 

I ve never tasted anything 

as good as grilled seagull. 

    Do you remember  

    Of course I remember. 

Have you ever known 

true hunger  my lady  

 i It s all I knew  i  

 i when I was a child. 

Until you found 

the Lord of Light  

Until he found me. 

I fear for our daughter s soul. 

 i Every mother should fear  i  

 i for her child s soul. 

    She s a stubborn little beast. 

    She s a child. 

You barely know her. 

You think she s sweet because 

she smiles when you visit. 

She s sullen and stubborn 

and sinful. 

Why else would the Lord of Light 

have seen fit to mark her face  

She needs the rod. 

She s my daughter. 

You will not strike her. 

As you command. 

Perhaps the Lady Melisandre 

could speak with her. 

 i   knocks   

Come in. 

Were you sleeping  Princess  

Did you watch the ceremony 

on the beach  

I heard it. 

And it frightened you  

Ser Axel was my uncle. 

 i He was always kind to me. 

They re in a better 

place now  Princess. 

 i The fire cleansed them  i  

 i of the sins of the world. 

But they screamed. 

Women scream 

when they give birth. 

Afterward they are 

filled with joy. 

Afterward they aren t 

ash and bone. 

You have so many 

questions  don t you  

 i So did I when I was a child. 

I was much like you. 

Only I wasn t a princess. 

And you didn t have this. 

No. 

But I suffered in other ways  

sweet girl  believe me. 

What do you know of the gods  

I read 

  The Seven Pointed Star.   

Lies and fables. 

Septons speak of seven gods. 

There are but two    

a god of light and love and joy 

and a god of darkness  

evil  and fear. 

Eternally at war. 

There are no seven heavens 

and no seven hells  

There s only one hell  Princess. 

The one we live in now. 

 i   heavy breathing   

 i   growls   

     i  Hodor.  i  

      breathing heavily   

Why did you wake me  

You ve been gone for hours. 

I was hungry. 

We re all hungry. 

I was just eating. 

Summer was eating. 

Your body can t live on 

the food your wolf consumes. 

 i Spending too much time in 

Summer s skin is dangerous. 

You re not a direwolf  Bran. 

Must be glorious  though. 

To run  to leap  to hunt. 

To be whole. 

 i I know that s tempting  

but if you re trapped 

in Summer for too long  

you ll forget what it was 

to be human. 

You d forget us  Bran. 

You d forget your mother 

and father. 

You d forget your brothers 

and sisters. 

You d forget Winterfell. 

You d forget you. 

And if we lose you  

we lose everything. 

 i   wind blowing   

 i   wolf barks

Let it be known 

that Margaery of House Tyrell 

 i and Joffrey of the Houses  i  

 i Lannister and Baratheon 

are one heart  one flesh  

one soul. 

 i Cursed be he 

 i who would seek  i  

 i to tear them asunder. 

With this kiss  

I pledge my love. 

  applause   

We have a new queen. 

Better her than you. 

    Bit much  wouldn t you say  

    It feels proportionate. 

    Proportionate to what  

    The expected extravagance. 

People who spend their money 

on this sort of nonsense 

tend not to have it for long. 

You ought to try enjoying 

something before you die. 

You might find it suits you. 

Not now  Mace. Lord Tywin 

and I are speaking. 

Anyway  I don t know what 

you re complaining about. 

I m paying my share. 

Shall we stick golden roses 

in half the meat pies 

to commemorate your generosity  

No  your heartfelt thank you 

is its own reward. 

I would imagine I d be hearing 

it again before long. 

Wars are rather expensive. 

  The Iron Bank 

will have its due.   

How they love 

to remind everyone. 

Almost as much as you 

Lannisters with your debts. 

I m not worried about 

the Iron Bank. 

We both know 

you re smarter than that. 

Come  Tywin  let us 

celebrate young love. 

     i    music playing    i  

      people laughing  chatting   

All taken care of. 

    You saw her board the ship  

    Aye  she s on it. 

You saw the ship sail away  

No one knows she s there 

but you  me  and Varys. 

How do you know  

Because if someone follows 

me without an invitation  

I m the last person 

they ever follow. 

There s someone following you  

She s gone. 

I know you don t want to 

believe it  but she is. 

Now  go drink till it feels 

like you did the right thing. 

Hello. 

    Hello. 

    Not you. 

You look exquisite  child. 

The wind has been 

at you  though. 

I haven t had the 

opportunity to tell you 

how sorry I was to hear 

about your brother. 

War is war  but killing 

a man at a wedding  

horrid. 

What sort of monster 

would do such a thing  

As if men need more 

reasons to fear marriage. 

My lady. 

My lady. 

Lord Tyrion  you see  

Not as bad as all that. 

Perhaps if your pauper husband 

were to sell his mule 

and his last pair of shoes  

he might be able to afford to bring 

you to Highgarden for a visit. 

Now that peace has come and 

all is right with the world  

it would do you good 

to see some of it. 

You must excuse me. 

It s time I ate 

some of this food I paid for. 

            A coat of gold             

            Or a coat of red             

 i             A lion still has claws             

            And mine  

my lord...             

Very good. Very good. 

Off you go. 

      coins clatter   

      crowd laughs   

My love  why don t we 

make the announcement  

  taps goblet   

Everyone. 

The queen would like 

to say a few words. 

  applause   

We are so fortunate 

to enjoy this marvelous 

food and drink. 

Not all among us are so lucky. 

To thank the gods for bringing 

the recent war to a just end  

King Joffrey has decreed 

that the leftovers 

from our feast be given 

to the poorest in his city. 

      applause   

     i    music playing   

You re an example to us all. 

Ser Jaime  I m very sorry. 

Ser Loras  it s quite all right. 

Your sister looks 

very beautiful. 

Loras  

 i As does yours. 

So  looking forward 

to your wedding  

Yes  very much. 

Our fathers are both 

rather keen on the prospect. 

They certainly are. 

Perhaps they should get married. 

  laughs   

If you were to marry Cersei  

she d murder you in your sleep. 

If you somehow managed 

to put a child in her first  

she d murder him  too  

long before he drew 

his first breath. 

Luckily for you  

none of this will happen 

because you ll never marry her. 

And neither will you. 

Your Grace. 

My king. 

    My queen. 

    Lady Brienne. 

So good of you to come. 

I m no lady  Your Grace. 

Did you just bow  

Apologies  Your Grace. 

I never did master the curtsy. 

You re the one who put a sword 

through Renly Baratheon. 

That s not true  my love. Brienne 

had nothing to do with it. 

A shame. 

I d knight the man that put an 

end to that deviant s life. 

I just wanted 

to congratulate you both 

and wish you good fortune. 

The country has been 

at war too long. 

I hope your reign 

is long and peaceful. 

    Yes  yes. 

    Thank you. 

I hope we see more of you. 

Lady Brienne. 

You re Lord Selwyn 

Tarth s daughter. 

That makes you a lady whether 

you want to be or not. 

As you say  Your Grace. 

I owe you my gratitude. 

You returned my brother 

safely to King s Landing. 

In truth  he rescued me  

Your Grace. 

More than once. 

Did he  

Haven t heard that story before. 

Not such a fascinating 

story  I m afraid. 

I m sure you have many 

fascinating stories. 

Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to 

Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. 

Must be exciting to flit 

from one camp to the next 

serving whichever lord 

or lady you fancy. 

I don t serve 

your brother  Your Grace. 

But you love him. 

Your Grace. 

No  no  come to my chambers and 

I will examine you personally. 

    She ll do no such thing. 

    Oh  Your Grace. 

Yes  well  this young 

lady sought my advice    

You should see Qyburn. 

He s quite good. 

    Your Grace. 

    Qyburn  Deplorable man. 

Brought shame on the Citadel 

with his repugnant experiments. 

More repugnant than your gnarled 

fingers on that girl s thighs  

Your Grace  

I am a man of learning. 

My little brother had you sent to the 

Black Cells when you annoyed him. 

What do you think I could do 

to you if you annoyed me  

I never meant to annoy anyone. 

But you are. 

You annoy me right now. 

Every breath you draw 

in my presence annoys me. 

So here s what I want you to do. 

I want you to leave my presence. 

Leave this wedding right now. 

Go to the kitchens 

and instruct them 

that all the leftovers from the feast 

will be brought to the kennels. 

Your Grace  

Queen Margaery    

The i  queen  i  is telling you 

the leftovers will feed the dogs 

or you will. 

A gold dragon to whoever 

knocks my fool s hat off. 

  crowd laughing   

You re in rather a good mood. 

    I suppose I am. 

    I won t ask why. 

    Small pleasures. 

    Your Grace. Lord Tywin. 

Prince Oberyn. 

I don t believe you 

have met Ellaria. 

This is the Lord Hand 

Tywin Lannister 

and Cersei Lannister 

the Queen Regent. 

I suppose it is 

former Queen Regent now. 

Lord Hand and Lady Cersei  

    Ellaria Sand. 

    My lord. My lady. 

Charmed. 

Can t say I ve ever 

met a Sand before. 

We are everywhere in Dorne. 

I have   brothers 

and sisters. 

Bastards are born 

of passion  aren t they  

We don t despise them in Dorne. 

No  

How tolerant of you. 

I expect it is a relief  

Lady Cersei  

giving up your regal 

responsibilities. 

Wearing the crown for so many years 

must have left your neck a bit crooked. 

I suppose you ll never 

know  Prince Oberyn. 

It s a shame your older brother 

couldn t attend the wedding. 

Please give him our regards. 

With any luck  

the gout will abate 

with time and he will 

be able to walk again. 

They call it 

the rich man s disease. 

A wonder you don t have it. 

Noblemen in my part 

of the country 

don t enjoy the same lifestyle 

as our counterparts in Dorne. 

People everywhere 

have their differences. 

In some places the highborn 

frown upon those of low birth. 

In other places the rape and 

murder of women and children 

is considered distasteful. 

What a fortunate thing for 

you  former Queen Regent  

that your daughter 

Myrcella has been sent 

to live in the latter 

sort of place. 

 i   taps goblet   

Everyone  silence  

Clear the floor. 

There s been too much 

amusement here today. 

A royal wedding 

is not an amusement. 

A royal wedding is history. 

The time has come for all of us 

to contemplate our history. 

My lords... 

my ladies...

the champion yet  are you  

A true champion defeats 

all the challengers. 

Surely there are 

others out there 

who still dare 

to challenge my reign. 

Uncle. 

How about you  I m sure 

they have a spare costume. 

 i   crowd laughs   

One taste of combat was 

enough for me  Your Grace. 

I would like to keep 

what remains of my face. 

 i I think you should fight him. 

This was but a poor imitation 

of your own bravery 

on the field of battle. 

I speak as a firsthand witness. 

 i Climb down from the high table 

 i with your new Valyrian sword 

and show everyone how 

a true king wins his throne. 

 i Be careful  though. 

This one is clearly 

mad with lust. 

It would be a tragedy for 

the king to lose his virtue 

hours before his wedding night.

A fine vintage. 

Shame that it spilled. 

It did not spill.

It s time for my father s toast.

Well  how does he expect me 

to toast without wine  

Uncle  you can be my cupbearer 

seeing as you re 

too cowardly to fight. 

Your Grace does me 

a great honor. 

It s not meant as an honor. 

Bring me my goblet.

The Lannisters have 

declared war on house Tyrell. 

They have declared war on Dorne. 

We must be allies now  

if we wish to survive. 

I offer vengeance... justice... 

Fire and blood. 

I traveled south 

under orders from the Lord Commander. 

You ought to be a Maester. 

Spending your life reading 

about the achievements 

of better men. 

It s a map of Dragonstone. 

That s dragonglass. 

A mountain of it  beneath the ground. 

Jon needs to know. 

You must send me away. 

I command you to heal yourself. 

I command you to find the cure. 

So why s a nice girl on her own 

heading to King s Landing  

I m going to kill the queen. 

I invited Euron Greyjoy  

the new king of the Iron Islands. 

The Iron Fleet is the greatest 

armada Westeros has ever seen. 

The surest way to a woman s 

heart is with a gift. 

I won t return to King s Landing 

until I have that for you. 

Shall we begin  

On a night like this  

you came into the world. 

I remember that storm. 

All the dogs in King s Landing 

howled through the night. 

I wish I could remember it. 

I always thought this 

would be a homecoming. 

Doesn t feel like home. 

We won t stay on Dragonstone for long. 

Good. 

Not so many lions. 

Cersei controls fewer 

than half the Seven Kingdoms. 

The lords of Westeros despise her. 

Even before your arrival  

they plotted against her. 

  Now... 

  They cry out for their true queen  

They drink secret toasts to my health  

People used to tell my 

brother that sort of thing  

and he was stupid 

enough to believe them. 

If Viserys had three dragons 

and an army at his back  

he d have invaded 

King s Landing already. 

Conquering Westeros 

would be easy for you. 

But you re not here to 

be queen of the ashes. 

No. 

We can take the Seven Kingdoms 

without turning it 

into a slaughterhouse. 

If the great houses support 

your claim against Cersei  

the game is won. 

With the Tyrell army and 

the Dornish on our side  

we have powerful allies in the south. 

I never properly thanked you for that. 

They joined our side  my queen  

because they believe in you. 

You served my father  

didn t you  Lord Varys  

I did. 

And then you served the 

man who overthrew him. 

I had a choice  Your Grace... 

serve Robert Baratheon or 

face the headman s axe. 

But you didn t serve him long. 

You turned against him. 

Robert was an improvement 

on your father  to be sure. 

There have been few rulers in history 

as cruel as the Mad King. 

Robert was neither mad nor cruel. 

He simply had no interest in being king. 

So you took it upon yourself 

to find a better one. 

Your Grace  

when I was ready to drink 

myself into a small coffin  

Lord Varys told me about a 

queen in the east who... 

Before I came to power  

you favored my brother. 

All your spies  your little birds  

did they tell you Viserys was 

cruel  stupid  and weak  

Would those qualities have made for a 

good king in your learned opinion  

Until your marriage to 

Khal Drogo  Your Grace  

I knew nothing about 

you  save your existence 

and that you were said to be beautiful. 

So you and your friends traded me 

like a prized horse to the Dothraki. 

Which you turned to your advantage. 

Who gave the order to kill me  

King Robert. 

Who hired the assassins  

Who sent word to Essos to 

murder Daenerys Targaryen  

Your Grace  I did what 

had to be done to... 

To keep yourself alive. 

Lord Varys has proven 

himself a loyal servant. 

Proven himself loyal  

Quite the opposite. 

If he dislikes one monarch  he 

conspires to crown the next one. 

What kind of a servant is that  

The kind the realm needs. 

Incompetence should not be 

rewarded with blind loyalty. 

As long as I have my 

eyes  I ll use them. 

I wasn t born into a great house. 

I came from nothing. 

I was sold as a slave and 

carved up as an offering. 

When I was a child  I lived in 

alleys  gutters  abandoned houses. 

You wish to know where 

my true loyalties lie  

Not with any king or queen  

but with the people. 

The people who suffer under despots 

and prosper under just rule. 

The people whose hearts you aim to win. 

If you demand blind allegiance  

I respect your wishes. 

Grey Worm can behead me or 

your dragons can devour me. 

But if you let me live  

I will serve you well. 

I will dedicate myself to 

seeing you on the Iron Throne 

because I choose you. 

Because I know the people have 

no better chance than you. 

Swear this to me  Varys. 

If you ever think I m 

failing the people  

you won t conspire behind my back. 

You ll look me in the eye 

as you have done today  

and you ll tell me how I m failing them. 

I swear it  my queen. 

And I swear this... if 

you ever betray me  

I ll burn you alive. 

I would expect nothing less 

from the Mother of Dragons. 

Forgive me  my queen. 

A red priestess from As shai 

has come to see you. 

She once served another who 

wanted the Iron Throne. 

It didn t end well for 

Stannis Baratheon  did it  

No  it didn t. 

You chose an auspicious day 

to arrive at Dragonstone. 

We ve just decided to pardon those 

who once served the wrong king. 

The Lord of Light doesn t have many 

followers in Westeros  does he  

Not yet  but even those who 

don t worship the Lord 

can serve his cause. 

What does your lord expect from me  

 The prince who was promised 

will bring the dawn.  

I m afraid I m not a prince. 

Your Grace  forgive me  

but your translation 

is not quite accurate. 

That noun has no gender 

in High Valyrian  

so the proper translation 

for that prophecy would be  

 The prince or princess who was 

promised will bring the dawn.  

Doesn t really roll off 

the tongue  does it  

No  but I like it better. 

And you believe this 

prophecy refers to me  

Prophecies are dangerous things. 

I believe you have a role to play. 

As does another... 

the King in the North  Jon Snow. 

Jon Snow  

  Ned Stark s bastard  

  You know him  

I travelled with him to the Wall 

when he joined the Night s Watch. 

And why do you think the Lord of 

Light singled out this Jon Snow  

Aside from the visions you ve 

seen in the flames  that is. 

As Lord Commander of the Night s Watch  

he allowed the wildlings 

south of the Wall 

to protect them from grave danger. 

As King in the North  

he has united those wildlings 

with the Northern houses  

so together they may 

face their common enemy. 

He sounds like quite a man. 

Summon Jon Snow. 

Let him stand before you 

and tell you the things 

that have happened to him  

the things that he has 

seen with his own eyes. 

I can t speak to prophecies 

or visions in the flames  

but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him. 

And I am an excellent 

judge of character. 

If he does rule the North  

he would make a valuable ally. 

The Lannisters executed his father 

and conspired to murder his brother. 

Jon Snow has even more reason 

to hate Cersei than you do. 

Very well. 

Send a raven north. 

Tell Jon Snow that his queen 

invites him to come to Dragonstone... 

and bend the knee. 

Gather round. Come here. 

You think it s really Tyrion  

It could be someone trying 

to lure you into a trap. 

Read the last bit. 

 All dwarves are bastards 

in their father s eyes.  

What does that mean  

It s something he said to 

me the first night we met. 

You know him better than any of us. 

What do you think  

Tyrion s not like the other Lannisters. 

He was always kind to me  

but it s too great a risk. 

 The Seven Kingdoms will bleed 

as long as Cersei sits 

on the Iron Throne. 

Join us. 

Together  we can end her tyranny.  

Sounds like a charmer. 

Of course  the casual mention 

of a Dothraki horde  

a legion of Unsullied  

and three dragons... 

a bit less charming. 

What  

Fire kills wights  you told me. 

What breathes fire  

You re not suggesting Jon meet with her  

  No  too dangerous. 

  But  

But if the Army of the Dead 

makes it past the Wall  

do we have enough men to fight them  

If the Mad King s daughter 

takes the Iron Throne  

she ll destroy the realm as we know it. 

Some of you are bannermen 

of House Tyrell. 

But House Tyrell is in open 

rebellion against the crown. 

With their help  the Mad King s daughter 

has ferried an army of 

savages to our shores... 

mindless Unsullied soldiers who will 

destroy your castles and your holdfasts  

Dothraki heathens who will burn 

your villages to the ground  

rape and enslave your women  

and butcher your children 

without a second thought. 

This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards 

centuries of service and loyalty. 

You all remember the Mad King. 

You remember the horrors he 

inflicted upon his people. 

His daughter is no different. 

In Essos  her brutality 

is already legendary. 

She crucified hundreds of 

noblemen in Slaver s Bay. 

And when she grew bored of that  

she fed them to her dragons. 

It is my solemn duty to protect 

the people  and I will. 

But I need your help  my lords. 

We must stand together  all of us... 

if we hope to stop her. 

She has three full grown 

dragons  Your Grace. 

The same as Aegon when he conquered 

the Seven Kingdoms. 

How do you propose to stop them  

We are currently at work 

on a solution  my lord. 

Lord Tarly. 

Ser Jaime. 

I believe you know my son. 

Ser Jaime. 

Rickard  isn t it  

Dickon. 

That s it. 

Thank you for coming. 

The other lords of the Reach look to 

you for guidance  now more than ever. 

They might not have come if you hadn t. 

If my queen summons me  

I answer the call. 

And I ve heard what she 

does to those who defy her. 

You ride for Horn Hill today  

I have an army to mobilize. 

Won t be long before 

the fighting starts. 

And which side will you be fighting for  

You were the only man to defeat 

Robert Baratheon in battle. 

Not even Rhaegar 

Targaryen could do that. 

It s a long ride back to the 

Reach  Ser Jaime. How may I serve  

I want you to be my ranking 

general in the wars to come. 

I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei 

and I want you to help 

me destroy her enemies. 

All her enemies. 

Including Olenna Tyrell. 

I m a Tarly. 

That name means something. 

We re not oathbreakers. 

We re not schemers. 

We don t stab our rivals in the back 

or cut their throats at weddings. 

I swore an oath to House Tyrell. 

You swore an oath to the 

crown as well  Lord Tarly. 

I ve known Olenna since I was a child. 

She was a great woman once. 

Now she s broken. 

She wants revenge so badly  

she brought the Dothraki to our shores. 

The Dothraki in Westeros for 

the first time in history. 

I know you don t like my sister  

but you have to make a choice. 

Do you fight with us 

or with foreign savages and eunuchs  

When the war is won  

the queen will need a new 

Warden of the South. 

I can think of no better man 

than Randyll Tarly. 

The infection 

has spread too far. 

You should have cut off your arm 

the moment you were touched. 

How long  

It ll be years before it kills you. 

Could be . 

Could be . 

But how long until...  

Your mind  

Six months  maybe fewer. 

Um... 

Pardon  Archmaester. 

I met Stannis Baratheon s 

daughter at Castle Black. 

She had the greyscale as 

a baby and was cured. 

  No. 

  Isn t there some way... 

Does this look 

like a baby to you  

  No. 

  Have you studied 

the varying rates of 

greyscale progression 

in infants and fully grown men  

No. 

Maester Cressen discovered 

Shireen Baratheon s 

affliction immediately. 

This is quite advanced. 

And beyond our skills  ser. 

Were you a commoner  I d have 

you shipped to Valyria at once 

to live out your life 

with the stone men. 

As an anointed knight  I ll 

allow you one more day. 

How you choose to spend 

that time is up to you. 

Come  Samwell. 

Should we send word to 

your family  Ser...  

Jorah. 

Jorah Mormont. 

Mormont  

There s no need. 

I ve been dead to them for years. 

Come  Samwell  

Have you ever been 

down here  Your Grace  

No  I can t say I have. 

I haven t seen these since Robert had 

them removed from the throne room. 

Curious that King Robert did 

not have them destroyed. 

They were his trophies. 

He couldn t keep them around. 

They would have made him look small. 

Sometimes he would come 

down here and look at them. 

I believe he brought his 

whores on occasion. 

Balerion the Dread. 

The beast that Aegon 

rode across the sea. 

His flames forged the Iron Throne 

and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. 

Powerful... 

but not invincible. 

Apparently  one of Daenerys s dragons 

was wounded by spears in the 

fighting pits of Meereen. 

And if they can be wounded  

they can be killed. 

The finest artillators and 

blacksmiths in King s Landing 

have been laboring day 

and night  Your Grace. 

If you ll kindly pull that lever. 

If you want the 

Iron Throne  take it. 

We have an army  a fleet  

and three dragons. 

We should hit King s Landing now  

hard  with everything we have. 

The city will fall within a day. 

If we turn the dragons loose  tens of 

thousands will die in the firestorms. 

It s called war. 

You don t have the stomach for 

it  scurry back into hiding. 

I know how you wage war. 

We don t poison little girls here. 

Myrcella was innocent. 

She was a Lannister. 

There are no innocent Lannisters. 

My greatest regret is that 

Oberyn died fighting for you. 

That s enough. 

Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen. 

You will treat him with respect. 

I am not here to be queen of the ashes. 

That s very nice to hear. 

Of course  I can t remember a queen 

who was better loved 

than my granddaughter. 

The common people loved her. 

The nobles loved her. 

And what is left of her now  

Ashes. 

Commoners  nobles  

they re all just children  really. 

They won t obey you 

unless they fear you. 

I m grateful to you  Lady 

Olenna  for your counsel. 

I m grateful to all of you. 

But you have chosen to follow me. 

I will not attack King s Landing. 

We will not attack King s Landing. 

Then how do you mean to 

take the Iron Throne  

By asking nicely  

We will lay siege to the capital  

surrounding the city on all sides. 

Cersei will have the Iron Throne  

but no food for her army or the people. 

But we won t use Dothraki and Unsullied. 

Cersei will try to rally 

the lords of Westeros 

by appealing to their loyalty  

their love for their country. 

If we besiege the city with foreigners  

we prove her point. 

Our army should be Westerosi. 

And I suppose we re 

providing the Westerosi  

You are. 

Lady Greyjoy will escort 

you home to Sunspear. 

And her Iron Fleet will 

ferry the Dornish army 

back up to King s Landing. 

The Dornish will lay 

siege to the capital 

alongside the Tyrell army. 

Two great kingdoms 

united against Cersei. 

So  your master plan 

is to use our armies. 

Forgive me for asking  but why did 

you bother to bring your own  

The Unsullied will have 

another objective. 

For decades  House Lannister has 

been the true power in Westeros. 

And the seat of that 

power is Casterly Rock. 

Grey Worm and the Unsullied 

will sail for the Rock and take it. 

Do I have your support  

You have mine. 

Dorne is with you  Your Grace. 

Thank you all. 

Lady Olenna  may I speak with you alone  

I realize you re here out of hatred 

for Cersei and not love for me. 

But I swear to you  she will 

pay for what she s done. 

And we will bring peace 

back to Westeros. 

Peace  

Do you think that s what 

we had under your father  

Or his father  Or his  

Peace never lasts  my dear. 

Will you take a bit of 

advice from an old woman  

He s a clever man  your Hand. 

I ve known a great many clever men. 

I ve outlived them all. 

You know why  

I ignored them. 

The lords of Westeros are sheep. 

Are you a sheep  

No. 

You re a dragon. 

Be a dragon. 

Maj  . 

You leave tomorrow. 

Were you going to say goodbye  

I will see you when I return. 

But you don t know when that will be. 

No one knows. 

I wish you good fortune. 

Missandei. 

It is hard for me to say goodbye to you. 

Why  

You know why. 

I don t. 

Y you are my weakness. 

That s what I am  

Your weakness  

When Unsullied are young  the 

masters learn their fears. 

One boy is scared of dogs  

one boy hates high places  

one is frightened of the ocean. 

They make the boy sleep with dogs 

or climb a cliff. 

They throw him in the water. 

If he learns to swim  good. 

If he drowns  good. 

Either way  strong Unsullied. 

But I had no fears. 

I was never the biggest  

never the strongest... 

but I was bravest  always. 

  I believe it. 

  Until... 

I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath. 

Now I have fear. 

I do  too. 

No. 

I want to see you. 

Please. 

Might be useful. 

Ch Vyalthan was a dreadful writer  

but an excellent researcher. 

  Archmaester  I wondered if I... 

  And this one. 

Maester Faull was quite the opposite... 

a brilliant stylist who invented 

half the stories he tells. 

Um  I wanted to ask you... 

If you re going to write 

histories  Tarly  

you have to do the research. 

If you want people to 

read your histories  

you need a bit of style. 

I m not writing  A Chronicle of the Wars 

Following the Death of King Robert I  

so it can sit on a shelf unread. 

What  You don t like the title  

What would you call it  then  

Mm  possibly something 

a bit more poetic  

We re not poets  Tarly. 

Um  Archmaester  if I 

could just have a moment. 

This is your moment. 

Use it wisely. 

I may have found a way 

to treat Ser Jorah. 

There are two recorded cases 

of advanced greyscale being cured. 

I found the procedure in 

the study of rare diseases 

by Archmaester Pylos. 

I m familiar with Archmaester Pylos 

and his study of rare diseases. 

  Oh  you are  

  Yes. 

And shall I tell you how he died  

From greyscale. 

  Oh. 

  The procedure s far too dangerous  

which is why it s now forbidden. 

Hello. 

What are you doing  

You re Jorah Mormont  

the only son of Jeor Mormont. 

My name is Samwell Tarly  

Sworn Brother of the Night s Watch  

training to serve as 

maester at Castle Black. 

I knew your father. 

I was with him when he died. 

You are not dying today  Ser Jorah. 

Drink this. 

  What is it  

  Rum. 

Drink it all  please. I m 

afraid this is going to hurt. 

If you could take off your shirt. 

If you wouldn t mind  bite down hard. 

I m sorry  but no one knows I m here  

and if they hear you screaming  

then we re both finished. 

Have you ever done this before  

No. 

But no one else will try it  

so I m the best you ve got. 

Have a seat. 

I m going to have to remove the entire 

upper layer of infected tissue  

then apply a medicinal 

ointment to the... 

Shh  shh  

Shh. 

Again  I m sorry  

but please try not to scream. 

They say her dragons are 

bigger than Aegon s. 

Horseshit. Cersei s just 

trying to frighten us. 

I hope it s true. 

If she lays siege to King s 

Landing  prices will triple. 

As long as we get back 

there before they start. 

One more round. It s a long ride. 

Arry  

Hello  Hot Pie. 

Sit down. 

Who s that for  

Mm. This is good. 

You think so  

The secret is browning the 

butter before making the dough. 

Most people don t do that  cause 

it takes up too much time. 

Mm  I didn t do that. 

You ve been making pies  

One or two. 

I can t believe you re here. 

Did you meet the big lady  

  Big lady  

  The lady knight  

You know  I figured she was a 

knight  cause she had armor on. 

She was looking for your sister  

but I told her about you. 

Did she ever find you  

She found me. 

What happened to you  Arry  

You got any ale  

  Where you heading  

  King s Landing. 

  Why  

  Heard Cersei s queen now. 

Heard she blew up the Great Sept. 

That must have been something to see. 

  Boom. 

  Mm. 

I can t believe someone would do that. 

Cersei would do that. 

I thought you d be 

heading for Winterfell. 

Why would I go there  

The Boltons have it. 

No  the Boltons are dead. 

What  

Jon Snow came down from Castle 

Black with a wildling army 

and won the Battle of the Bastards. 

He s King of the North now. 

You re lying. 

Why would I lie about that  

He s your brother  right  

Thanks for the pie. 

Friends don t pay. 

Can t believe I thought you were a boy. 

You re pretty. 

Thanks. 

Take care of yourself  Hot Pie. 

Try not to get killed. 

Ah  I won t. 

I m like you  Arry. 

I m a survivor. 

 miles to King s Landing. 

One bottle of rum. You 

think we ll make it  

Come in. 

A raven  my king  from the Citadel. 

This message was sent 

to me by Samwell Tarly. 

He was my brother at the Night s Watch  

a man I trust as much as 

anyone in this world. 

He s discovered proof that Dragonstone 

sits on a mountain of dragonglass. 

I received this a few days ago 

from Dragonstone. 

It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister. 

He is now Hand of the Queen 

to Daenerys Targaryen. 

She intends to take the Iron 

Throne from Cersei Lannister. 

She has a powerful army at her back 

and  if this message is to be believed  

three dragons. 

Lord Tyrion has 

invited me to Dragonstone 

to meet with Daenerys. 

And I m going to accept. 

Accept   

We need this dragonglass  my lords  

We know that dragonglass can destroy 

both white walkers and their army. 

We need to mine it and 

turn it into weapons. 

But more importantly  we need allies  

The Night King s army 

grows larger by the day. 

We can t defeat them on our own. 

We don t have the numbers. 

Daenerys has her own army 

and she has dragonfire. 

I need to try and persuade 

her to fight with us. 

Ser Davos and I will ride 

for White Harbor tomorrow  

then sail for Dragonstone. 

Have you forgotten what 

happened to our grandfather  

The Mad King invited 

him to King s Landing 

  and roasted him alive. 

  I know that. 

She is here to reclaim the Iron 

Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. 

The North is one of 

those seven kingdoms. 

This isn t an invitation  it s a trap. 

It could be  but I don t 

believe Tyrion would do that. 

You know him. He s a good man. 

Your Grace  with respect  I 

must agree with Lady Sansa. 

I remember the Mad King all too well. 

A Targaryen cannot be trusted. 

  Nor can a Lannister. 

  Yeah  

Aye. We called your brother king. 

And then he rode south 

and lost his kingdom. 

Winter is here  Your Grace. 

We need the King in the 

North in the North. 

Aye  

You all crowned me your king. 

I never wanted it. 

I never asked for it. 

But I accepted it because 

the North is my home. 

It s part of me  and I will 

never stop fighting for it  

no matter the odds. 

But the odds are against us. 

None of you have seen the Army 

of the Dead. None of you. 

We can never hope to defeat them alone. 

We need allies  powerful allies. 

I know it s a risk. 

But I have to take it. 

Then send an emissary. 

Don t go yourself. 

Daenerys is a queen. 

Only a king can convince her to help us. 

It has to be me. 

You re abandoning your people  

You re abandoning your home. 

I m leaving both in good hands. 

  Whose  

  Yours. 

You are my sister. 

You re the only Stark in Winterfell. 

Until I return  the North is yours. 

I delivered his bones myself. 

Presented them to Lady Catelyn 

as a gesture of goodwill 

from Tyrion Lannister. 

Seems like a lifetime ago. 

Do give Lord Tyrion my 

best when you see him. 

I was sorry when he died. 

Your father and I had our differences  

but he loved Cat very much. 

So did I. 

She wasn t fond of you  was she  

Well  it appears she 

vastly underestimated you. 

Your father and brothers are gone  

yet here you stand  King in the North. 

Last best hope against the coming storm. 

You don t belong down here. 

Forgive me. 

We haven t ever talked... properly. 

I wanted to remedy that. 

I have nothing to say to you. 

Not even  thank you   

If it weren t for me  you d have been 

slaughtered on that battlefield. 

You have many enemies  my king  but I 

swear to you  I m not one of them. 

I love Sansa  

as I loved her mother. 

Touch my sister  and 

I ll kill you myself. 

  Ready  

  Ready  

Ready  

Come on. 

  Yah  

  Come on  

Nymeria  

Nymeria  it s me  Arya. 

I m heading north  girl. 

Back to Winterfell. I m 

finally going home. 

Come with me. 

Come with me. 

That s not you. 

You can t have them all. 

It s not fair. 

I m oldest. 

Mama will want Cersei for herself. 

She s not my mama. 

You can have Cersei. 

I want the Mountain. 

The Mountain killed Father. 

He ll crush you with one hand. 

Father got careless. 

That s what Mama says. 

Will you shut up about Mama  

 Mama  Mama  Mama.  

Maybe I ll kill you both 

before we take King s Landing. 

And then I won t have to share. 

 Mama   

How can you drink this piss  

When we reach Sunspear  

I ll treat you to a Dornish red. 

The best in the world. 

Have you ever been to Dorne  

A few times. 

Never stayed long. 

A boy in every port  

A boy  a girl. 

Depends on the port. 

Could we get some more  

I thought it wasn t for you. 

I m developing a taste for it. 

  He s not your servant. 

  It s fine. 

So  you re going to be 

Queen of the Iron Islands. 

Once I kill my uncle. 

And what will you be  handsome  

Whatever my queen commands. 

He ll be my advisor  my protector. 

Oh  I see. 

Your protector. 

So  if someone gets too close to you... 

He might have to intervene. 

To hold that person back. 

Until they ve made their 

intentions known. 

Why are you standing all 

the way over there  then  

A foreign invasion is underway. 

Leave him be. 

Seems like you don t need a protector. 

Stay here. 

We re under attack  

Euron. 

You mother s below deck. Keep her safe. 

Aah  

Yah  

Aah  

Yah  

Yah  

Kill us. 

Get it over with. 

Give your uncle a kiss. 

Little Theon  

Ah  come on  you cockless coward. 

I have her. 

Come and get her. 

Is the Wall as big as they say  

Bigger. 

  How much longer  

  A few more days. 

I found something 

at the Fist of the First Men. 

What does it do  

I m not sure that 

it does anything. 

You re not supposed to be here. 

  If your father knew   

  He said you re a traitor. 

I am  child. 

You must get bored down here. 

I brought you 

something to read. 

My lady  I can t 

read the words. 

I wouldn t know where to start. 

At the beginning. 

This word is Aegon. 

The Yunkish train 

bed slaves  not soldiers. 

  We can defeat them. 

  But they won t meet us on the field. 

 i They have strong walls.  i  

Women in our position 

must make the best 

of our circumstances. 

How do I make the best 

of my circumstances  

I have to marry him. 

I didn t ask for this marriage. 

I will marry Sansa Stark 

and do my duty by her. 

My feelings for you 

have not changed. 

Listen to me  my lady. 

I m not your lady. 

I m your whore. 

You will release 

every slave in Yunkai. 

You are mad. 

We have powerful friends. 

Friends who would take great 

pleasure in destroying you. 

Perhaps we ll make 

a slave of you as well. 

He said he had 

powerful friends. 

Who was he talking about  

  I don t know. 

  Find out. 

Haven t you ever wondered 

where your strength came from  

  Your blood is noble. 

  I m just a bastard. 

The bastard of Robert 

of the House Baratheon. 

There is power 

in a king s blood. 

You re a liar  

You lied to Gendry  

you lied to me. 

Now   

  Anguy  bring her back. 

  Come back  girl  

Kick all you like  wolf girl. 

Won t do you no good. 

I ll give you one try  girl. 

Kill me and you re free. 

But if I live  

I ll break both your hands. 

Go on  hit me. 

 i Hit me hard.  i  

Sulk all you want. 

The truth is  you re lucky. 

You don t want to be 

alone out here  girl. 

Someone worse than me 

would find you. 

There s no one worse than you. 

Ha  you never knew my brother. 

He once killed a man 

for snoring. 

There s plenty worse than me. 

There s men who like 

to beat little girls  

men who like to rape them. 

I saved your sister 

from some of them. 

You re lying. 

Ask her  if you 

ever see her again. 

Ask her who came back for her 

when the mob 

had her on her back. 

They would have 

taken her every which way 

and left her there 

with her throat cut open. 

Is that the Blackwater  

The Blackwater  

Where do you think 

I m taking you  

Back to King s Landing 

to Joffrey and the queen. 

Fuck Joffrey. 

Fuck the queen. 

That s the Red Fork. 

I m taking you to the Twins. 

But why  

Because your mother 

and brother will be there 

and they ll pay me for you. 

Why would they be at the Twins  

Those outlaws you 

love so much never told you  

The whole countryside 

is yapping about it. 

Your uncle is marrying 

one of the Frey girls. 

So quit trying 

to bash my skull in 

and we might just make it there 

in time for the wedding. 

Men who fight for gold have 

neither honor nor loyalty. 

 i They cannot be trusted.  i  

 i They can be trusted to 

kill you if they re well paid.  i  

 i The Yunkish  i  

 i are paying them well.  i  

You know these men  

Only by the broken swords 

on their banners. 

They re called the Second Sons. 

A company led by 

a Braavosi named Mero  

 The Titan s Bastard.  

Is he more titan or bastard  

He s a dangerous man  khaleesi. 

They all are. 

How many  

 i    Your Grace.  i  

 i Armored and mounted.  i  

Enough to make a difference  

It s hard to collect 

wages from a corpse. 

I m sure the sellswords prefer 

to fight for the winning side. 

I imagine you re right. 

I d like to talk to the Titan s 

Bastard about winning. 

He may not agree to meet. 

He will. 

A man who fights for gold can t 

afford to lose to a girl. 

 i Your Grace   i   i allow me to present  i  

 i the captains  i  

 i of the Second Sons    i  

Mero of Braavos  

Prendahl na Ghezn  

and... 

Daario Naharis. 

You are the Mother of Dragons  

I swear I fucked you once 

in a pleasure house in Lys. 

  Mind your tongue. 

 i   Why   i  

I didn t mind hers. 

She licked my ass 

like she was born to do it. 

You  slave girl  bring wine. 

We have no slaves here. 

You ll all be slaves 

after the battle 

unless I save you. 

Take your clothes off and 

come and sit on Mero s lap 

and I may give you 

my Second Sons. 

Give me your Second Sons 

and I may not have you gelded. 

Ser Barristan  how many men 

fight for the Second Sons  

Under    Your Grace. 

We have more  don t we  

 i   Unsullied.  i  

I m only a young girl  

new to the ways of war  

but perhaps a seasoned 

captain like yourself 

can explain to me how you 

propose to defeat us. 

I hope the old man is better with 

a sword than he is with a lie. 

You have   Unsullied. 

You re very young 

to be a captain. 

He s not a captain. 

He s a lieutenant. 

Even if your numbers are right  

you must admit the odds 

don t favor your side. 

The Second Sons have faced 

worse odds and won. 

The Second Sons have 

faced worse odds and run. 

Or you could fight for me. 

We ve taken the slavers  gold. 

We fight for Yunkai. 

 i I would pay  i  

 i you as much and more.  i    

Our contract is our bond. 

If we break our bond  

no one will hire 

the Second Sons again. 

Ride with me and you ll 

never need another contract. 

You ll have gold and castles 

and lordships of your choosing 

when I take back 

the Seven Kingdoms. 

You have no ships. 

You have no siege weapons. 

You have no cavalry. 

A fortnight ago  I had no army. 

A year ago  I had no dragons. 

You have two days to decide. 

Show me your cunt. I want to see 

if it s worth fighting for. 

You seem to be 

enjoying my wine. 

Perhaps you d like 

a flagon to help you ponder. 

Only a flagon  

And what are my brothers 

in arms to drink  

  A barrel  then. 

  Good. 

The Titan s Bastard 

does not drink alone. 

In the Second Sons  

we share everything. 

After the battle  

maybe we ll all share you. 

I ll come looking for you 

when this is over. 

Ser Barristan  

if it comes to battle  

kill that one first. 

Gladly  Your Grace. 

Half Robert  half lowborn. 

Show the boy to his chambers. 

 i Have the maids draw him a bath and 

find him some decent clothes.  i  

I ll come visit you soon. 

What do you mean 

to do with him  

You know what I mean 

to do with him. 

Then why bathe him 

and dress him in fine clothes  

If it needs to be done  do it. 

Don t torture the boy. 

Have you ever slaughtered 

a lamb  my king  

No. 

If the lamb sees the knife  

she panics. 

Her panic seeps into her meat  

darkens it  fouls the flavor. 

You ve slaughtered many lambs  

And none have seen the blade. 

 And tho   and thowg... 

V v visenya... 

Targaryen... 

rod   rode 

Vhagar   

Vhag    

Fuck me. 

 i  Visenya Targaryen  i  

rode Vhagar  

the smallest of the dragons  

though still... 

large enog   

enough   enough 

to swallow 

a horse whole.  

Your Grace. 

They feeding you enough  

 i Two meals a day.  i  

Cold for breakfast  

hot for supper. 

I cannot complain. 

You don t belong 

in a place like this. 

Well  it s sad to say  

but I ve seen worse. 

Yeah. 

I m sorry about your son. 

 i Didn t get the chance  i  

 i to tell you before.  i  

Good lad. 

Loyal lad. 

Melisandre s returned. 

I didn t know she d been gone. 

Came back with a bastard boy. 

Robert s bastard boy. 

Why  

She says there s power 

in king s blood. 

She s going to kill him. 

Sacrifice him. 

Forgive me  Your Grace  

I m not a learned man  

but is there a difference 

between kill and sacrifice  

The boy is your nephew. 

What of it  

We re at war. 

Why should I spare the son 

of some tavern slut 

Robert bedded 

one drunken night  

Because he has 

your blood in his veins. 

So did Renly. 

Renly wronged you. 

Renly declared himself king when 

the throne belonged to you. 

He raised an army  

stole your bannermen. 

This boy has done you no harm. 

  He s an innocent. 

  How many boys live in Westeros  

How many girls  How many men  

How many women  

The darkness will devour 

them all  she says. 

The night that never ends. 

Unless I triumph. 

I never asked for this. 

No more than I asked 

to be king. 

We do not choose our destiny  

but we must do our duty  no  

Great or small  

we must do our duty. 

What s one bastard boy 

against a kingdom  

Your Grace  

why did you come 

to see me today  

I came to free you. 

If you swear never to raise your 

hand to the Lady Melisandre again. 

I swear it. 

I can t swear never 

to speak against her. 

You have little regard 

for your own life. 

Quite little  Your Grace. 

Verging on none. 

You could have freed me 

yesterday or tomorrow  

but you came to me now before 

this boy is put to the knife 

because you knew 

I d counsel restraint. 

You came to hear me say it 

because you believe it yourself. 

You re not a man 

who slaughters innocents 

for gain or glory. 

When my son was five 

he said to me  

 I don t ever 

want to die.  

I wanted to say to him   You won t  child. 

You won t ever.  

 i I hated the idea of him lying 

awake in the dark  afraid.  i  

I think mothers and fathers 

made up the gods 

because they wanted their children 

to sleep through the night. 

I saw a vision in the flames. 

A great battle in the snow. 

I saw it. 

And you saw whatever 

she gave birth to. 

 i I never believed   i  

 i but when you see the truth   i  

when it s right there 

in front of you 

as real as these iron bars  

how can you deny 

her god is real  

Little dragon bitch. 

She talks too much. 

You talk too much. 

She won t talk so much 

when she s choking on my cock. 

  Unsullied stand 

between her and your cock. 

My cock will find a way. 

Tell him. Is there any place 

that my cock can t reach  

She ll tell me whatever 

you pay her to tell me. 

Daario Naharis  the whore 

who doesn t like whores. 

I like them very much. 

I just refuse to pay them. 

And I m no whore  my friend. 

She sells her sheath 

and you sell your blade. 

  What s the difference  

  I fight for beauty. 

For beauty  

We fight for gold. 

The gods gave men two gifts to 

entertain ourselves before we die   

the thrill of fucking a woman 

who wants to be fucked 

and the thrill of killing 

a man who wants to kill you. 

You ll die young. 

 i What do we do  i  

 i about the dragon girl   i  

We can t beat   Unsullied 

on the battlefield. 

There won t be a battle. And we don t 

have to deal with her eunuchs. 

We only have to deal with her. 

  She s well guarded. 

 i   Tonight s a new moon.  i  

One of us slips into her camp past 

her Unsullied and her knights. 

Which one of us  

Close your eyes  love. 

Three coins. 

A coin from Meereen  

a coin from Volantis  

and a coin from Braavos. 

The Braavosi does the deed. 

One for each of us  darling. 

No peeking. 

Do you hear me  

Follow my voice. 

I m right here. 

You have something for me  

Valar morghulis. 

Lady Sansa. 

You look very handsome  

my lord. 

Oh  yes. 

The husband of your dreams. 

But you do look glorious. 

Perhaps we could have 

a moment alone. 

Do you mind  

Podrick  could you escort 

Lady Stark s handmaiden  

My lady  

I want you to know 

I didn t ask for this. 

I hope I will not 

disappoint you  my lord. 

No  don t. 

You don t have to speak to me 

as a prisoner anymore. 

You won t be a prisoner 

after today. 

You ll be my wife. 

I suppose that s a 

different kind of prison. 

I just wanted to say   

I m just trying 

to say very badly   

I just   

just want to say 

I know how you feel. 

I doubt that 

very much  my lord. 

You re right. 

I have no idea how you feel. 

And you have no idea 

how I feel. 

But I promise you 

one thing  my lady. 

I won t ever hurt you. 

Do you drink wine  

When I have to. 

Well  today you have to. 

 i You look radiant  Your Grace.  i  

Radiant  

Why radiant  

It s the word 

that came to mind. 

We re going to be sisters soon. 

We should be friends. 

You re a musical girl  

aren t you  

I imagine you have 

a lovely voice. 

A better dancer than a 

singer  I m afraid. 

Ah  but you know the song 

 The Rains of Castamere   

Of course. They play it 

so often here at court. 

So you know the story 

of House Reyne of Castamere  

Not as well as you  I m sure. 

House Reyne 

was a powerful family. 

Very wealthy. 

The second wealthiest 

in Westeros. 

Aren t the Tyrells the second 

wealthiest family in Westeros now  

Of course  ambitious 

climbers don t want to stop 

on the second highest rung. 

If only you could take 

that final step  

you d see further 

than all the rest. 

You d be alone with nothing 

but blue sky above you. 

So Lord Reyne built a castle 

as grand as Casterly Rock. 

He gave his wife diamonds 

larger than any 

my mother ever wore. 

And finally one day  

he rebelled against my father. 

Do you know where 

House Reyne is now  

Gone. 

Gone. 

A gentle word. 

Why not say slaughtered  

Every man  woman  and child 

put to the sword. 

I remember seeing 

their bodies hanging 

high above the gates 

of Casterly Rock. 

My father let them rot 

up there all summer. 

It was a long summer. 

 And now the rains 

weep o er their halls  

and not a soul to hear.  

If you ever 

call me sister again  

I ll have you strangled 

in your sleep. 

What are you doing  

Your father s gone. 

As the father of the realm  

it is my duty to give you 

away to your husband. 

You may now cloak the bride 

and bring her 

under your protection. 

Could you... 

Thank you. 

Your Grace  Your Grace  

 i my lords  my ladies   i  

 i we stand here in the sight  i  

 i of gods and men  i  

 i to witness the union  i  

 i of man and wife.  i  

 i One flesh  one heart  one soul   i  

now and forever. 

Have you ever seen one like it  

I ve never seen anything 

like any of this. 

Not in my life. 

It s shocking  isn t it  

the first time 

you encounter real wealth  

When I was your age  I lived 

on one bowl of stew a day. 

And stew is a kind word for it. 

In Flea Bottom we called 

them bowls of brown. 

We d pretend that the meat 

in them was chicken. 

We knew it wasn t chicken. 

Here  taste this. 

You think I m trying 

to poison you  

That s good. 

That s really good. 

 i Where do you think it s from   i  

I couldn t even guess. 

Doesn t matter  does it  

It s the real thing 

or it s not. 

You only need a tongue 

to tell the difference. 

Go on  have some more. 

You still don t trust it. 

You think this is all a mistake 

and that you ll have to pay 

somehow for every bite you take. 

That thought had 

crossed my mind  yeah. 

There are no mistakes. 

Not for us. 

I m a mistake. 

I m only here because 

my father grabbed my mother 

instead of the girl 

next to her in the tavern. 

Your father chose your mother because 

the Lord of Light willed it. 

He willed it so you 

could be here right now 

with a power inside you 

you can t even begin 

to understand. 

And He brought me here 

to draw it from you 

and birth it into the world. 

We re both a part of His plan. 

He wants this for us. 

No  He demands this of us. 

I don t understand. 

This   

this doesn t seem 

very religious. 

According to whom  

The Silent Sisters  

With their stern looks  

muzzled mouths  

and dried up cunts  

What have their gods 

done for you  

Hmm  

When you pray to them  

what s their answer  

A god is real or he s not. 

You only need eyes to see. 

Death is coming 

for everyone and everything. 

A darkness that will 

swallow the dawn. 

And we can stop it  you and I. 

Let me show you 

what you have inside you. 

Come fight death with me. 

What are you doing  

You have to trust me. 

What    

Get it away. 

Get it off me. 

Don t fight  don t fight. 

They won t take much. 

Why are you doing this  

I told you there s power 

in the blood of kings. 

And you have so much blood. 

No. No  no  no  no  

Not there. 

Not there  

You can blame Ser Davos. 

He didn t believe in 

the power of king s blood. 

He wanted a demonstration. 

 i Please.  i  

 i Please  Your Grace.  i  

 i My lord   i  

The usurper Robb Stark. 

The usurper Balon Greyjoy. 

The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. 

So their son 

will be your nephew. 

After you re wed 

to Cersei  of course. 

And you will be 

the king s stepfather 

and brother in law. 

When you marry the king  

 i Joffrey s mother will  i  

 i become his sister in law  i  

 i and your son  i  

 i will be Loras  nephew   i  

Grandson  

I m not sure. 

But your brother will become 

your father in law. 

That much is beyond dispute. 

Will you pardon me  my lord  

Of course. Of course. 

En   enjoy. 

Perhaps you could talk 

to your bride to be instead. 

I ve got a lifetime for that. 

Stay. 

You seem rather drunk. 

Rather less than I plan to be. 

Isn t it a man s duty to be 

drunk at his own wedding  

This isn t about your wedding. 

Renly Baratheon had a wedding. 

Your wife needs a child  

a Lannister child  

as soon as possible. 

  And  

  If you re going to give her one  

you need to perform. 

What did you once call me  

A drunken little 

lust filled beast. 

  More than once. 

   i There you have it.  i  

Nothing to worry about. 

Drinking and lust  

no man can match me 

in these things. 

I am the god of tits and wine. 

I shall build 

a shrine to myself 

at the next brothel I visit. 

You can drink  you can joke  

you can engage 

in juvenile attempts 

to make your father 

uncomfortable  

but you will do your duty. 

Well... 

My father once told me   

Nobody cares what 

your father once told you. 

Congratulations  my lady. 

Thank you  Your Grace. 

Well  you ve done it. 

You ve married a Lannister. 

Soon you ll have 

a Lannister baby. 

It s a dream come true 

for you  isn t it  

What a glorious day. 

Yes  Your Grace. 

I suppose it doesn t 

really matter 

which Lannister 

puts the baby into you. 

Maybe I ll pay you 

a visit tonight 

after my uncle passes out. 

How d you like that  

You wouldn t  

That s all right. Ser Meryn and 

Ser Boros will hold you down. 

Time for the bedding ceremony. 

There will be 

no bedding ceremony. 

Where s your respect 

for tradition  Uncle  

Come  everyone. 

Pick her up and carry her 

to her wedding bed. 

Get rid of her gown. She won t 

be needing it any longer. 

Ladies  attend to my uncle. 

He s not heavy. 

There will be 

no bedding ceremony. 

There will be if I command it. 

Then you ll be fucking 

your own bride 

with a wooden cock. 

What did you say  

What did you say   

I believe we can dispense 

with the bedding  Your Grace. 

 i I m sure Tyrion did not mean  i  

 i to threaten the king.  i  

A bad joke  Your Grace. 

Made out of envy 

of your own royal manhood. 

Mine is so small. 

My poor wife won t 

even know I m there. 

Your uncle is clearly 

quite drunk  Your Grace. 

 i I am.  i  

Guilty. 

But   

but it is my wedding night. 

My tiny drunk cock 

and I have a job to do. 

Come  wife. 

I vomited on a girl once 

in the middle of the act. 

Not proud of it. 

But I think honesty 

is important 

between a man and wife  

don t you agree  

Come  I ll tell you 

all about it. 

Put you in the mood. 

Is that wise  my lord  

Tyrion  Sansa. 

My name is Tyrion. 

Is that wise  Tyrion  

Nothing was ever wiser. 

Astoundingly long. 

What  

Neck. 

You have one. 

How old are you exactly  

. 

Well  talk won t 

make you any older. 

My lord father has commanded me 

to consummate this marriage. 

Stop. 

I can t. 

I could  I won t. 

But your father   

If my father wants 

someone to get fucked  

I know where he can start. 

I won t share your bed. 

Not until you want me to. 

What if I never want you to  

And so my watch begins. 

Yes  Your Grace. 

How can anyone 

speak  languages  

It only took Your Grace a year to 

learn Dothraki reasonably well. 

Yes  well  it was 

either learn Dothraki 

or grunt at my husband 

and hope   

what do you mean 

reasonably well  

Dothraki is difficult 

for the mouth to master. 

So guttural and harsh. 

 i Athjahakar.  i  

Athjahaka. 

Ath ja hakar. 

Athjahakar. 

Well  I suppose 

I m a bit out of practice. 

Your High Valyrian 

is very good  Your Grace. 

The gods could not devise 

a more perfect tongue. 

 i It is the only proper  i  

 i language for poetry.  i  

No screaming or she dies. 

What do you want  

You. 

Let her go. 

Don t scream  lovely girl. 

You were sent here to kill me  

So why haven t you  

I don t want to. 

What do your captains 

have to say about that  

You should ask them. 

Why  

We had philosophical 

differences. 

  Over what  

  Your beauty. 

 i It meant more to me  i  

 i than it did to them.  i  

You re a strange man. 

I m the simplest man 

you ll ever meet. 

I only do what I want to do. 

And this is supposed 

to impress me  

Yes. 

Why would I trust a man 

who murders his comrades  

They ordered me to murder you. 

 i I told them I preferred not to.  i  

 i They told me I had no choice.  i  

I told them 

I am Daario Naharis. 

I always have a choice. 

They drew their swords 

and I drew mine. 

Will you fight for me  

Swear to me. 

The Second Sons are yours 

and so is Daario Naharis. 

My sword is yours  

my life is yours  

my heart is yours. 

You really ought to knock. 

I brought your breakfast. 

It s getting dark. 

We could stay here 

for the night. 

How hard can it be 

to build a fire  

It doesn t matter. 

Come under the furs. 

We can keep each other warm. 

He winked at me before. 

  I doubt it. 

  I saw him wink at me. 

He blinked. 

I suppose it s a rather 

philosophical difference 

between a wink and a blink. 

A what  

Well  I mean  

there s no real difference. 

A wink is on purpose. 

You thought of a name yet  

It would be easier to refer 

to him if he had a name. 

Sometimes do you talk fancy 

on purpose to confuse me  

What  No. 

This is just the way I talk. 

I ll build that fire. 

Don t you think 

he should have a name  

I don t know many boys  names. 

Let s see  

there s Duncan  

Kevan  Jon... 

Guymon  

Feldan  Tristifer. 

Craster. 

Uh  yes. 

Maybe that s not   

Mormont. 

That s a lovely idea  

but Mormont s a last name. 

Why is it a last name  

Well  it s a family name. 

For instance  

I m Samwell Tarly. 

Samwell is my birth name 

and Tarly is my family name. 

You see  So my father 

is also a Tarly. 

His name is Samwell Tarly  too  

No  Randyll Tarly. 

Randyll is a handsome name. 

Please don t name him Randyll. 

Is your father cruel like mine  

Different manner of cruel. 

Not Randyll  then. 

Don t. 

Don t go out there. 

I ll be back. 

I just want to look. 

Go inside. 

Go back inside. 

I ll   

It s come for the baby. 

Stay back  

You stay back  

No  you can t 

have him  No  

No  

Here we are. 

Ready  

 The Rains of Castamere.  

You fucking deaf  

Same wrong guess 

every fucking time. 

Listen  you cunt. 

Oh  

 The Bear 

and the Maiden Fair.  

There s a man 

with an ear. 

Too bad you got 

a hangnail for a cock. 

First time I saw you 

with your breeches down  

I thought you were 

a eunuch. 

You ve seen it  girls. 

Like a baby snail 

peeking out of his shell. 

Your baby was crying 

this morning. 

Woke me up. 

You hear me  

Yes. 

Well  got 

anything to say  

I m sorry 

he woke you up. 

I don t care 

if you re sorry. 

Keep that baby quiet 

or I will. 

Don t you 

ever touch him. 

Little wildling bitch. 

 i You should have stayed  i  

 i with your own kind.  i  

 i You listening to me   i  

  Shut your mouth. 

  What  

It s just an owl  

you dumb bitch. 

No  it s not. 

    Shh. 

I should never 

have left her there. 

  You couldn t have known. 

  Of course I could ve known. 

They ve been raiding 

the villages close by. 

And we just cower in here while 

they slaughter our brothers. 

Our brothers had orders 

to stay at Castle Black. 

So it s all right  then  

Black Jack and Kegs 

and Mully chopped to pieces 

 cause they broke the rules  

 i I didn t say it  i  

 i was all right.  i  

I m saying they shouldn t 

have been there. 

We re pledged to guard 

the realms of men. 

She s dead because of me. 

We can t even guard 

Mole s Town. 

We can t go after them. 

You know that. 

It s what they want. 

And little Sam. 

As if I cut 

their throats myself. 

Maybe she managed 

to hide herself. 

 i I thought  i  

 i all of you was dead.  i  

You went north with Mormont 

and no one came back. 

Not for ages. 

But then you did. 

She survived Craster 

and he was the worst 

shit I ve ever met. 

She survived the long march 

to the Wall. 

 i She survived a white walker   i  

 i for fuck s sake.  i  

She might have got out. 

She might have. 

If they hit Mole s Town  

then we re next. 

Mance and his army 

must be close. 

 i   of them.  i  

And there s what  

 of us left  

You counting Black Jack  

Kegs  and Mully  

. 

How do  men 

stop    

Whoever dies last  

be a good lad 

 i and burn the rest of us.  i  

Once I m done 

with this world  

I don t want 

to come back. 

 i You think he was  i  

 i spying on you   i  

 i No  not spying.  i  

 i The Dothraki think  i  

 i outsiders are ridiculous  i  

taking shame 

in the naked body. 

They make love under the stars 

for the whole khalasar to see. 

Yes  Your Grace. 

But you are not 

Dothraki. 

No. 

Well  I don t see 

why it matters. 

Grey Worm 

isn t interested. 

None of the Unsullied care 

what s under our clothes. 

He was interested. 

What  

I believe he was 

interested. 

When the slavers 

castrate the boys  

do they take all of it  

All of it  

The   

the pillar 

and the stones. 

I don t know  

Your Grace. 

Haven t you 

ever wondered  

Yes  Your Grace. 

 i Missandei.  i  

The lessons you give I 

in common tongue... 

these are precious to I. 

  To me. 

  To me. 

I don t remember teaching 

you the word precious. 

Jorah the Andal  

he teaches I   

he teaches me 

this word. 

Do you remember the name 

you were given at birth  

I remember nothing. 

Only Unsullied. 

When they cut you  

do you remember that  

I m sorry. 

I m sorry they did 

that to you. 

Why  

Why sorry  

It s a terrible thing 

to do to a boy. 

If the masters 

never cut me  

I never am Unsullied. 

I never stand in 

the Plaza of Pride 

when Daenerys Stormborn 

orders us 

to kill the masters. 

I never am chosen 

to lead the Unsullied. 

I never meet Missandei 

from the island of Naath. 

I am sorry I   

for today. 

I am sorry. 

Kraken. Mmm. 

Strong as long 

as they re in the sea. 

When you take them 

out of the water  

no bones. 

They collapse 

under their proud weight 

and slump into 

a heap of nothing. 

You d think 

they know that. 

Unfortunately  

they re not very bright. 

What do you tell them  

I m Theon Greyjoy  

son of Balon  

heir to the Iron Islands. 

  And what are you really  

  I m Reek. 

Are you sure  

You do look very much 

like a lord. 

Formidable  proud. 

I m Reek. 

Until when  

Always. 

  Forever. 

  That s right. 

Until you re rotting 

in the ground. 

Remember what you are 

and what you re not. 

Bring me Moat Cailin. 

No closer. 

Who are you  

I m Kenning  

commander of 

this garrison. 

And you say 

you re Theon Greyjoy  

Yes. 

And why should 

I believe that  

I was born on Pyke 

to Balon Greyjoy. 

His third 

and last living son. 

I am your prince. 

I swear it 

by the Drowned God. 

What is dead 

may never die. 

What is dead 

may never die. 

And if you were 

my prince  

why are you marching 

with a Bolton army  

Lord Bolton took me 

captive after Winterfell. 

He sent me to treat 

with you in good faith 

as your fellow ironborn. 

And what does 

Lord Bolton want  

You are fading 

from sickness  

you are badly outnumbered  

and you re hundreds 

of miles from the sea. 

Lord Bolton implores you 

to protect your men 

and abandon this fortress 

you can no longer hold. 

Do this  and he will be 

just and fair with you 

as he has been with me. 

The Boltons will give you safe 

passage to the Stony Shore. 

He wants us 

to surrender  

My own father  

your king  

surrendered years ago 

to Robert Baratheon. 

I watched him 

bend the knee. 

There was no shame there. 

He fought with honor  

as did you. 

 No shame.  

 Fought with honor.  

I m sorry  

I didn t hear. 

 No shame.  

 Fought with honor.  

Only a whipped dog 

would speak this way. 

Or a woman. 

Are you a woman  boy  

You don t know   

The ironborn 

will not surrender. 

Reek. My name is Reek... 

You go tell 

your master that  

Theon Greyjoy  

or whoever the fuck 

you are. 

My name is Reek. 

What in the hell 

are you muttering  

I m Reek. 

Reek. 

If we yield  we live  

Is that what it says 

on this paper here  

Yes. Have your men raise the 

white flag and open the gates. 

You re going home. 

 i   You didn t really think  i  

 i   I d let them go  did you   i  

It s fallen out 

of fashion  flaying. 

Sad  but true. 

Traditions 

are important. 

Where are we 

without our history  

  Eh  

  Yes  my lord. 

Will we go home now  

I believe we will. 

To our new home. 

 i You have foreign blood   i  

 i don t you  Baelish   i  

A great grandfather 

from Braavos  yes. 

I suppose 

all of our ancestors 

came from somewhere 

else originally. 

 i Our forebearers  i  

 i settled the Vale  i  

 i thousands of years ago.  i  

 i We ve fought off invaders  i  

 i ever since.  i  

The beauty of the Vale 

is matched only 

by the nobility 

of its great families. 

Lady Arryn often told me 

that you were her rock  

Lord Royce. 

She told me nothing 

about you  Baelish. 

But I didn t need 

to hear from her. 

Moneylender. 

Whoremonger. 

You ve been licking Tywin 

Lannister s boots so long  

  It s a wonder your tongue s not black. 

  My lord   

And when Jon Arryn named you 

Master of Coin  no one cared. 

Always been a grubby job. 

Why not let 

a grubby man do it  

 i But when I heard  i  

 i you were lurking here   i  

fawning over 

the Lady Arryn   

Lady Arryn 

invited me. 

She and I have been 

close since childhood. 

Yes  we all know 

how close you were. 

 i Lady Arryn s predilections  i  

 i were her own affair.  i  

Her death is our affair. 

Of course. Her suicide 

shattered us all. 

She was an odd fish. 

Everyone knew that. 

But suicide  

 i She adored  i  

 i that boy of hers.  i  

I don t see her abandoning him. 

Not by choice. 

 i Strange that within days  i  

 i of your arrival   i  

you ve married Lady Arryn and she s 

fallen through the Moon Door. 

She was always prone 

to melancholy. 

My lady wasn t meant for a 

world as brutal as ours. 

We were told there was a witness. 

A girl. 

A niece of yours  

I believe. 

A girl with no learning 

and scattered wits. 

I assure you  

she would be of no help. 

We d like 

to speak with her. 

  Let me fetch her. 

 i   No need.  i  

We prefer to hear her 

testimony unadulterated. 

 i Come closer  child.  i  

You have nothing 

to fear from us or him. 

 i Lord Baelish here  i  

 i is your uncle   i  

 i Your name is Alayne   i  

 i Perhaps you would feel more comfortable 

if Lord Baelish left the room.  i  

  My lady   

  I wasn t asking you. 

  He can stay.   Speak up  girl  

you re not a damn kitchen mouse. 

Tell us what you saw. 

I m sorry  Lord Baelish. 

I have to tell the truth. 

I ll tell you 

everything. 

Please  Alayne  

leave nothing out. 

My name is not Alayne. 

It s Sansa Stark  

eldest daughter 

of Lord Eddard Stark. 

Lord Royce  we met when 

you came to Winterfell. 

You were escorting your son 

Ser Waymar to the Wall. 

Sansa Stark  

You tell lies right to my 

face  you little worm  

Lord Baelish 

has told many lies. 

All to protect me. 

 i Since my father  i  

 i was executed   i  

I have been a hostage 

in King s Landing. 

A plaything for Joffrey 

to torture 

or Queen Cersei 

to torment. 

They beat me  

they humiliated me  

they married me 

to the Imp. 

I had no friends 

in King s Landing... 

except one. 

He saved me. 

Smuggled me away 

when he had the chance. 

He knew I d be safe 

here in the Eyrie 

with my own blood  

my Aunt Lysa. 

The Lannisters have 

friends everywhere. 

 i Even the Vale.  i  

 i He made me swear not to 

tell anyone my true name.  i  

Your secret is safe 

with us  my lady. 

 i Your father grew up  i  

 i right here in these halls.  i  

We hunted together 

many times. 

He was a fine man. 

Tell us what happened 

to your aunt  Sansa. 

You knew her well  

my lords  my lady. 

You knew she was 

a troubled woman. 

She always loved 

Lord Baelish. 

She told me herself. 

From the moment he arrived 

at the gates of Riverrun  

a boy of eight carrying everything 

he owned in a little sack. 

 i She confessed to me  i  

 i she never loved Lord Arryn.  i  

She did as her father commanded  

as so many of us have. 

 i When the gods finally allowed  i  

 i her to be with Lord Baelish   i  

she was so happy. 

For a time. 

My aunt 

was a jealous lady. 

She was terrified 

that Lord Baelish 

didn t love her 

anymore. 

That he would abandon 

her for a younger woman. 

And then... 

one day she saw 

him kiss me. 

Lady Sansa. 

It was a peck on the cheek  

Lord Royce  nothing more. 

Lord Baelish is my uncle 

now  in truth  by marriage. 

He s always been 

so kind to me. 

I was so happy to be here  

to be free. 

All because of him. 

But my aunt 

turned on me. 

She cursed me. 

Called me a whore. 

Promised to throw me 

through the Moon Door. 

When Lord Baelish tried 

to calm her  

she struck him. 

She said she didn t want 

to live anymore. 

 i She stood on the edge  i  

 i of that Moon Door.  i  

He tried 

to reason with her. 

Promised her she was the 

only one he had ever loved  

but she stepped through 

those doors and she was   

Shh. 

Shh  it s not your fault  

sweet girl. 

It s not 

your fault. 

You could see it in the 

way she raised that boy. 

Feeding him from her own teats 

when he was  years old. 

Lord Royce  

This is hardly the time. 

Apologies  my lady. 

And to you 

as well  Baelish. 

We treated you 

a bit harshly. 

You want justice  

Lord Royce. 

I can hardly 

complain about that. 

I want the same. 

Not much justice to be meted 

out in suicide  is there  

For Lysa  no. 

But for her son  

Only  years ago  

the knights of the Vale 

rode behind Jon Arryn  

Ned Stark  Robert Baratheon. 

They fought together 

to overcome the Mad King. 

And since then  

Arryn and Royce  

Corbray  Waynwood  

all the great houses of the 

Vale watched from the corner. 

A timid boy 

at a tavern brawl. 

Are you questioning 

our courage  

I want to know 

which side you re on. 

Do you support 

the Lannisters  

the house that executed 

your friend Ned Stark  

Of course we don t support 

the damn Lannisters. 

No  Catelyn Stark begged her sister 

for support and Lysa refused. 

By staying out of the fray  

you ve allowed Tywin Lannister 

to destroy his rivals 

on every compass point. 

Who stands 

against him now  

Who would you have 

us back  Lord Baelish  

Robb Stark is dead. 

I d have you back 

Robin Arryn  

Lord of the Vale. 

Robin Arryn is 

a sickly little boy. 

And sickly little boys 

sometimes become powerful men. 

More often 

they die young. 

I adored Lysa 

with all my heart. 

But she loved her son so much  

she became overprotective. 

He needs to learn 

how to swing a sword. 

How to ride a horse. 

  Aye  it s time. 

  Yes  it s time. 

Time for him 

to tour the Vale  

to visit all the castles 

in his domain. 

Time for Robin 

to leave the nest. 

 i Ser Barristan.  i  

Yes  

Who sent you  

  Ser Barristan. 

  Ser Jorah. 

Have I forgotten 

a council meeting  

No. 

What s this  

A royal pardon 

signed by 

Robert Baratheon. 

You spied on her. 

Who gave you this  

Does it matter  

Have you told her  

I wanted to tell you 

first  man to man 

rather than go 

behind your back. 

Let me speak 

with her in private. 

You ll never be alone 

with her again. 

Why did the usurper 

pardon you  

If we could 

speak alone. 

No  speak to me here. 

Explain it to me. 

Who do you think 

sent this to Meereen  

Who profits  

This is the work 

of Tywin Lannister. 

He wants to divide us. 

If we re fighting each other  

we re not fighting him. 

The pardon was signed 

the year we met. 

Why were you pardoned  

Unless you re saying 

this document was forged. 

It is not forged. 

Why  then  

I sent letters to Varys  

the spymaster 

of King s Landing. 

What was the content 

of these letters  

  Information. 

  What information  

When you and Viserys 

arrived in Pentos. 

His plan to marry you 

to Khal Drogo. 

 i When you were married.  i  

When your brother died. 

You told him I was 

carrying Drogo s child  

  I   

  Yes or no  

  Khaleesi. 

   i Don t call me that.  i  

Did you tell him I was 

carrying Drogo s child  

Yes. 

That wine merchant 

tried to poison me 

because of 

your information. 

I stopped you 

from drinking his wine. 

Because you knew 

it was poisoned. 

I suspected. 

You betrayed me 

from the first. 

Forgive me. 

I never meant   

please  Khaleesi  

forgive me. 

You sold my secrets to 

the man who killed my father 

  and stole my brother s throne... 

  I have protected you. 

Fought for you. 

Killed for you. 

...and you want me 

to forgive you  

I have loved you. 

Love  

Love  How can you 

say that to me  

 i Any other man  and I 

would have you executed.  i  

But you  I do not want you 

in my city dead or alive. 

Go back to your masters 

in King s Landing. 

Collect your pardon 

if you can. 

Daenerys  please. 

Don t ever presume 

to touch me again 

or speak my name. 

You have until dusk 

to collect your things 

and leave this city. 

 i If you re found in Meereen  i  

 i past break of day   i  

I ll have your head 

thrown into Slaver s Bay. 

Go. 

Now. 

Moat Cailin 

is yours  Father. 

Walk with me. 

Has there been 

any word from Locke  

No. 

Unimportant. 

A cripple  

a young boy. 

None of the northern 

lords have seen them. 

Dead most likely. 

Most of the ironborn 

have fled the North. 

Now more will follow  

thanks to you. 

Tell me what you see. 

Moors  fields  hills. 

Tell me what you see. 

Nothing. 

Not nothing. 

The North. 

Ride  miles that way  

you re still in the North. 

 miles that way. 

 miles that way. 

The North is larger than the 

other six kingdoms combined. 

And I am the Warden 

of the North. 

The North is mine. 

Now tell me  

what is your name  

Ramsay Snow. 

No  not Ramsay Snow. 

Open it. 

From this day 

until your last day  

you are Ramsay Bolton  

son of Roose Bolton  

Warden of the North. 

You honor me. 

I swear I will 

uphold your name 

and your tradition. 

I will be worthy 

of you  Father  

I promise. 

Come  Reek  

I ll be needing a bath. 

Yes  

 i First time I saw you   i  

 i you were just a child.  i  

 i A girl from the North come to 

the capital for the first time.  i  

Not a child any longer. 

Why did you help me  

They would have thrown you 

through the Moon Door 

if they found 

you guilty. 

 i That s not an answer.  i  

If they d have 

executed you  

what would they 

have done with me  

I don t know. 

Neither do I. 

Better to gamble 

on the man you know 

than the strangers 

you don t  

And you think 

you know me  

I know what you want. 

 i Do you   i  

I thought 

it d make me happy  

but it doesn t. 

Not really. 

Nothing makes 

you happy. 

  Lots of things make me happy. 

  Like what  

Killing Polliver  

killing Rorge. 

So you re sad because you didn t 

get to kill Joffrey yourself. 

Is that it  

At least I could 

have been there to watch. 

I wanted to see the look in his 

eyes when he knew it was over. 

Aye  nothing in the world 

beats that look. 

You protected him 

for most of his life. 

You think you 

could have saved him  

I wasn t the damn 

wine taster. 

Little shit deserved 

to die  but poison   

poison s a woman s weapon. 

Men kill with steel. 

That s your stupid 

pride talking. 

It s why you ll never 

be a great killer. 

I d have killed Joffrey with 

a chicken bone if I had to. 

I d pay good money 

to see that. 

You should have 

let me burn it. 

It s a fleabite. 

That fleabite s got you walking 

a lot slower than you used to. 

Well  we won t have to 

walk too much further. 

You really think my 

aunt will pay for me  

Aye  she ll pay. 

I ve never even 

met her. 

Doesn t matter. 

You re her blood. 

Family  honor  

all that horseshit. 

It s all you lords 

and ladies ever talk about. 

I m not a lady. 

Who would pass 

the Bloody Gate  

The bloody Hound  

Sandor Clegane. 

And his... 

traveling companion 

Arya Stark  

 i niece of your lady  i  

 i Lysa Arryn.  i  

Then I offer 

my condolences. 

Lady Arryn died. 

Three days ago. 

I ve never left home 

before  Uncle Petyr. 

  I m afraid to leave. 

  You shouldn t be. 

The Lord of the Vale belongs 

in the Eyrie  Mother said. 

She said it s not 

safe outside. 

It wasn t safe 

for her inside. 

People die 

at their dinner tables. 

They die in their beds. 

They die squatting 

over their chamber pots. 

Everybody dies 

sooner or later. 

Don t worry 

about your death. 

Worry about your life. 

Take charge of your life 

for as long as it lasts. 

That is what it means 

to be Lord of the Vale. 

Shall we go  

Wine always helps. 

I thank you 

for it. 

Trial by combat. 

Deciding a man s guilt 

or innocence 

in the eyes of the gods 

by having two other men 

hack each other to pieces. 

Tells you something 

about the gods. 

How much longer  

Soon. 

Do you think 

Oberyn has a chance  

The Red Viper of Dorne. 

You don t get a name like that 

unless you re deadly  right  

 i I ve never  i  

 i seen him fight.  i  

Oh  he s going to die. 

I m going to die. 

Oberyn believes in himself. 

That s putting it mildly. 

What s the punishment 

for regicide  

Drawing and quartering  

Hanging  

   i Breaking at the wheel   i  

  Beheading. 

 i Seems rather  i  

 i ordinary.  i  

 i And he was my nephew  i  

 i as well  so what is that   i  

Fratricide is brothers. 

Filicide is sons. 

Nepoticide. 

That s the one. 

Matricide  patricide  

infanticide  suicide. 

There s no kind of killing that 

doesn t have its own word. 

Cousins. 

 i Cousins  you re right.  i  

There is no word 

for cousin killing. 

Well done. 

Do you remember cousin Orson  

Orson Lannister  

Of course. Wet nurse 

dropped him on his head. 

  Left him simple. 

   i Simple   i  

Used to sit all day 

in the garden. 

Crushing beetles 

with a rock. 

Nothing made him happier. 

Nothing made you happier. 

You d think being 

tormented from birth 

would have given you some 

affinity for the afflicted. 

On the contrary. Laughing 

at another person s misery 

was the only thing that made 

me feel like everyone else. 

The joke wore thin  though. 

 i For you.  i  

 i You drifted away.  i  

I had other interests. 

Yes  other interests. 

But I stayed with Orson. 

 i Why   i  

I was curious. 

Why was he smashing 

all those beetles  

What did he 

get out of it  

 i First thing I did  i  

 i was ask him.  i  

 Orson  why are you smashing 

all those beetles   

He gave me an answer. 

 Smash the beetles. 

Smash  em.  

 i I wasn t deterred.  i  

I was the smartest 

person I knew. 

Certainly I had the wherewithal 

to unravel the mysteries 

that lay at the heart 

of a moron. 

So I went to 

Maester Volarik s library. 

Volarik. 

Tried to touch me once. 

Turns out  far too much has 

been written about great men 

and not nearly enough 

about morons. 

Doesn t seem right. 

In any case  

I found nothing 

that illuminated the nature 

of Orson s affliction 

or the reason behind his 

relentless beetle slaughter. 

 i So I went back  i  

 i to the source.  i  

 i I may not have been able  i  

 i to speak with Orson   i  

but I could observe him  

watch him 

the way men 

watch animals 

to come to a deeper understanding 

of their behavior. 

And as I watched  

I became more and more 

sure of it. 

There was something 

happening there. 

His face was like 

the page of a book 

written in a language 

I didn t understand. 

But he wasn t mindless. 

He had his reasons. 

 i And I became possessed  i  

 i with knowing what they were.  i  

I began to spend inordinate 

amounts of time watching him. 

I would eat my lunch 

in the garden  

chewing my mutton 

to the music of... 

And when I wasn t watching 

him  I was thinking about him. 

Father droned on about 

the family legacy 

 i and I thought about  i  

 i Orson s beetles.  i  

I read the histories 

of Targaryen conquests. 

Did I hear dragon wings  

No. 

I heard... 

 i And I still couldn t figure  i  

 i out why he was doing it.  i  

And I had to know  

because it was horrible 

that all these beetles should 

be dying for no reason. 

Every day around the world  

men  women  and children 

are murdered by the score. 

Who gives a dusty fuck 

about a bunch of beetles  

I know  I know. But still  

it filled me with dread. 

Piles and piles of them  

years and years of them. 

How many countless living 

crawling things 

smashed and dried out 

and returned to the dirt  

In my dreams I found myself 

standing on a beach 

made of beetle husks 

stretching as far 

as the eye could see. 

I woke up crying  

weeping for their 

shattered little bodies. 

I tried to stop 

Orson once. 

He was twice your size. 

He just pushed me 

aside with a  kuuh  

and kept on smashing. 

Every day until 

that mule 

kicked him in the chest 

and killed him. 

So what do you think  

Why did he do it  

What was it all about  

I don t know. 

Good luck today. 

Looks like 

very light armor. 

I like to move around. 

You could at least 

wear a helmet. 

You shouldn t drink 

before a fight. 

You learn this during your 

years in the fighting pits  

I always drink 

before a fight. 

It could get you killed. 

It could get me killed. 

Today is not 

the day I die. 

You re going 

to fight that  

I m going 

to kill that. 

He is the biggest man 

I ve ever seen. 

Size does not matter when 

you are flat on your back. 

Thank the gods. 

In the sight of gods 

and men  

we gather to ascertain 

the guilt or innocence 

of this... 

 i man Tyrion Lannister.  i  

 i May the Mother grant  i  

 i them mercy.  i  

May the Father give them 

such justice as they deserve. 

And may the Warrior 

guide the hand... 

    ...of our champion   

Don t leave me 

alone in this world. 

Never. 

Have they told you 

who I am  

Some dead man. 

I am the brother 

of Elia Martell. 

Do you know why I have come 

all the way to this stinking 

shit pile of a city  

For you. 

I m going to hear you 

confess before you die. 

You raped my sister. 

You murdered her. 

You killed her children. 

Say it now and we can 

make this quick. 

Say it. 

You raped her. 

You murdered her. 

You killed her children. 

You raped her  

You murdered her  

You killed her children  

You raped her  

You murdered her  

You killed 

her children  

Wait. 

Are you dying  

No  no  no. 

You can t die yet. 

You haven t confessed. 

Say it. 

Say her name. 

Elia Martell. 

You raped her. 

You killed her children. 

Elia Martell. 

Who gave you the order  

Who gave you 

the order   

Say her name  

You raped her  

You murdered her  

 i You killed her children.  i  

Say it. 

Say her name. 

Say it  

Elia Martell. 

I killed her 

children. 

Then I raped her. 

Then I smashed her head 

in like this  

The gods have made 

their will known. 

 i Tyrion Lannister   i  

 i in the name of King Tommen  i  

 i of the House Baratheon   i  

 i First of His Name   i  

you are hereby 

sentenced to death. 

Yah  

Left high  left low. 

Right low  

lunge right. 

You break anything  

the Septa will have my head. 

What is   

Your sister knew perfectly 

well we were to leave today. 

  How she could forget   

  She didn t forget. 

She s with her dancing master. 

She s with him every morning. 

She always comes back with scrapes 

and bruises. She s so clumsy. 

Hush  

Go back to your room. 

Bar the doors 

and do not open them for anyone 

you do not know. 

  What is it  What s happening  

  Do as I told you. 

Run  

 i This way   i  

Left  right. 

Rah  

Now you are dead. 

You said right  

but you went left. 

And now you are 

a dead girl. 

Only  cause you lied. 

My tongue lied. 

My eyes 

shouted the truth. 

You were not seeing. 

I was so. 

I watched  but you   

watching is not seeing  

dead girl. 

The seeing  

the true seeing  

that is the heart 

of swordplay. 

Arya Stark  

come with us. 

Your father wants 

to see you. 

And why is it 

that Lord Eddard is 

sending Lannister men 

in place of his own  

I am wondering. 

Mind your place  

dancing master. 

 i This is no  i  

 i concern of yours.  i  

My father wouldn t 

send you. 

And I don t have to go 

with you if I don t want. 

Take her. 

Are you men or snakes  that you 

would threaten a child  

Get out of my way  

little man. 

 i I  i  am Syrio Forel... 

Foreign bastard. 

...And you will be speaking 

to me with more respect. 

Kill the Braavosi. 

Bring the girl. 

Arya child  we are done 

with dancing for the day. 

Run to your father. 

Bloody oafs. 

Be gone now  Arya. 

Come with me. 

Run. 

The first sword of Braavos 

does not run. 

What do we say 

to the God of death  

Not today. 

Go. 

Not today. 

Not today. 

Stay away from me. 

I ll tell my father. 

I ll   I ll tell 

the Queen. 

Who do you think sent me  

Needle. 

There she is. 

  What do you want  

  I want you  wolf girl. 

  Come here. 

  Leave me be. 

My father s a lord. 

He ll reward you. 

 i She ll  i  reward me   

the Queen  

Stay away  

Lord Stark  

you must be thirsty. 

Varys. 

I promise you 

it isn t poisoned. 

Why is it no one ever 

trusts the eunuch  

Not so much  My Lord. 

I would save the rest  

if I were you. 

Hide it. Men have been known to die 

of thirst in these cells. 

What about 

my daughters  

The younger one seems 

to have escaped the castle. 

Even my little birds 

cannot find her. 

  And Sansa  

  Still engaged to Joffrey. 

Cersei will keep her close. The rest 

of your household though   

all dead  

it grieves me to say. 

I do so hate 

the sight of blood. 

You watched my men being 

slaughtered and did nothing. 

And would again  My Lord. 

I was unarmed  unarmored and 

surrounded by Lannister swords. 

When you look at me 

do you see a hero  

What madness led you 

to tell the Queen 

you had learned the truth 

about Joffrey s birth  

The madness of mercy. 

That she might 

save her children. 

 i Ah  the children.  i  

It is always 

the innocents who suffer. 

It wasn t the wine that killed Robert  

nor the boar. 

The wine slowed him down 

and the boar ripped him open  

but it was your mercy 

that killed the King. 

I trust you know you are 

a dead man  Lord Eddard  

The Queen 

can t kill me. 

Cat holds her brother. 

The wrong brother 

sadly. 

And lost to her. 

Your wife has let the Imp 

slip through her fingers. 

If that s true  

then slit my throat 

and be done with it. 

Not today  My Lord. 

Tell me something  Varys. 

Who do you truly serve  

The Realm  My Lord. 

Someone must. 

It s Othor  

without a doubt. 

The other one is 

Jafer Flowers  My Lord  

 i less the hand  i  

 i the wolf tore off.  i  

Any sign of Benjen 

or the rest of his party  

Just these two  

My Lord. 

Been dead awhile  

I d say. 

  Mmm. 

  The smell. 

What smell  

There is none. 

If they d be dead for a long time  

wouldn t there be rot  

We should burn them. 

Snow s not wrong  My Lord. 

Fire will do for them. 

The Wildling way. 

I want Maester Aemon 

to examine them first. 

You may be 

a coward  Tarly  

 i but you re not stupid.  i  

  Get them inside. 

  You heard him. 

Lord Commander  

Maester Aemon awaits you 

in his chambers   

a raven 

from King s Landing. 

Come on  

move  em out. 

Bring me a horn 

of ale  Snow  

 i and pour one  i  

 i for yourself.  i  

The King is dead. 

Is there any word 

of my father  

Sit. 

Lord Stark has been 

charged with treason. 

They say he conspired 

with Robert s brothers 

to deny the throne 

to Prince Joffrey. 

 i I hope you re not thinking  i  

 i of doing anything stupid.  i  

Your duty lies here now. 

My sisters were 

in King s Landing too. 

I m sure they ll be 

treated gently. 

Your father has proved to be 

an awful traitor  dear. 

King Robert s body 

was still warm 

when Lord Eddard began plotting 

to steal Joffrey s rightful throne. 

He wouldn t do that. 

He knows how much I love Joffrey. 

He wouldn t. 

Please  Your Grace  

there s been a mistake. 

Send for my father. He ll tell you   

the King was his friend. 

Sansa sweetling  you are innocent of 

any wrong. We know that. 

 i Yet you are the daughter  i  

 i of a traitor.  i  

How can I allow you 

to marry my son  

 i A child born  i  

 i of a traitor s seed  i  

is no fit consort 

for our King. 

 i She is a sweet thing now   i  

 i Your Grace   i  

but in  years who knows 

what treasons 

she may hatch  

No  I m not. I ll be a good wife 

to him  you ll see. 

I ll be a Queen just like you  

I promise. I won t hatch anything. 

The girl is innocent  

Your Grace. 

She should be given a chance 

to prove her loyalty. 

Little dove  you must 

write to Lady Catelyn 

and your brother  

the eldest  what s his name  

Robb. 

Word of your father s arrest 

will reach him soon  no doubt. 

Best it comes from you. 

If you would help 

your father  

urge your brother 

to keep the King s peace. 

Tell him to come to King s Landing 

and swear his fealty to Joffrey. 

If   if I could see my father  

talk to him about   

You disappoint me  child. 

We have told you 

of your father s treason. 

Why would you want 

to speak to a traitor  

I only meant that   

what will happen to him  

  That depends. 

  On   on what  

On your brother. 

And on you. 

Treason  

Sansa wrote this  

It is your sister s hand  

but the Queen s words. 

You are summoned to King s Landing 

to swear fealty to the new King. 

Joffrey puts my father in chains  

now he wants his ass kissed  

This is a royal 

command  My Lord. 

  If you should refuse to obey   

  I won t refuse. 

His Grace summons me 

to King s Landing  

I ll go to King s Landing. 

But not alone. 

Call the banners. 

All of them  My Lord  

They ve all sworn to defend 

my father  have they not  

They have. 

Now we see what 

their words are worth. 

Yeah. 

Are you afraid  

I must be. 

Good. 

Why is that good  

It means 

you re not stupid. 

You ve had this 

since dawn  

He sent it to me  

not you. 

I ve only shown it 

to you as a courtesy. 

A courtesy   

My husband has been 

taken prisoner. 

My son intends 

to declare war. 

A war  

Your son against 

the Lannisters  

You should go to him. 

Teach him patience. 

Ned rots in a dungeon 

and you speak of patience  

He is your brother by law  

Does family mean 

nothing to you  

Family means 

everything to me. 

And I will not 

risk Robin s life 

to get caught up in another 

of your husband s wars. 

  I m hungry. 

  Hush now  darling. 

You just ate. 

You will not support us then  

Do I understand you correctly  

  But I m hungry  

  Soon  love  soon. 

You re always 

welcome here  sister. 

But if you re asking me to send men 

from the Vale to fight   

That is what I ask. 

Go on  sweet. 

Time for your bath. 

I ll feed you after. 

If you fear for the safety 

of your son   

Of course I fear 

for the safety of my son  

Are you an idiot  

They killed my husband. 

 i You say they shoved  i  

 i your boy from a window.  i  

These people 

will do anything. 

And that is why 

we have to stop them. 

The knights of the Vale 

will stay in the Vale 

where they belong  

to protect their Lord. 

Will you shut up  

There s hill tribes 

all around here. 

If I m going to die  

it may as well be 

with a song in my heart. 

I should just take your food 

and leave you here. 

Eh  What would 

you do then  

Starve  most likely. 

You don t think 

I d do it  do you  

What do you want  Bronn  

Gold  Women  

Golden women  

Stick with me 

and you ll have them all  

for as long as I m around 

and not for a moment longer. 

But you knew that. 

That is why you so valiantly took 

up arms to defend my honor. 

Fair enough. 

But don t go looking 

for me to bend the knee 

and  My Lord  you 

every time you take a shit. 

I m not your toady 

and I m not your friend. 

Though I would treasure 

your friendship  

I m mainly interested 

in your facility with murder. 

And if the day ever comes when 

you re tempted to sell me out  

remember this  

Whatever their price  

I ll beat it. 

I like living. 

 i Tyrion.  i  

Tyrion. 

Tyrion. 

Come  share our fire. 

Help yourselves 

to our goat. 

When you meet your Gods  

you tell them 

Shagga Son of Dolf 

of the Stone Crows 

sent you. 

I am Tyrion son of Tywin 

of Clan Lannister. 

How would you like to die  

Tyrion son of Tywin  

In my own bed  

at the age of  

with a bellyful of wine and 

a girl s mouth around my cock. 

Take the half man. 

He can dance for the children. 

Kill the other one. 

No no no no no  

My   my House is rich 

and powerful. 

If you see us 

through these mountains  

my father will 

shower you with gold. 

We have no use 

for a half man s promises. 

Half a man maybe  but at least I have 

the courage to face my enemies. 

What do the Stone Crows do  

Hide behind rocks 

and shiver 

when the knights 

of the Vale ride by  

Are those the best weapons 

you could steal  

Good enough 

for killing sheep  

if the sheep 

don t fight back. 

Lannister smiths 

shit better steel. 

You think you can win us over 

with your trinkets  

That trinket is worth more than 

everything your tribe owns. 

But if you help us  

Shagga Son of Dolf  

I will not give you trinkets. 

I will give you this. 

What is  this   

The Vale of Arryn. 

The Lords of the Vale have always 

spat upon the hill tribes. 

The Lords of the Vale 

want me dead. 

I believe it is time 

for new Lords of the Vale. 

Ser Alliser  

 i Now there s a rare sight    i  

not only a bastard  

but a traitor s bastard. 

  Jon  no  

  Jon  stop  put it down  

Blood will always tell. 

You ll hang 

for this  bastard. 

I told you not to do 

anything stupid. 

You re confined 

to quarters. Go. 

Ghost  what s wrong  

Is something out there  

Commander  

Stay. 

Hello  

Who s there  

Lord Commander  

 i Snow   i

I thought the Dothraki 

didn t believe in money. 

Gold to hire ships  

Princess  

ships to sail 

to Westeros. 

Jorah  make them stop. 

  Khaleesi  

  You heard me. 

These men have shed blood for their Khal. 

Now they claim their rewards. 

Princess  you have

Thank you  

silver lady. 

Who are you  

I am named Mirri Maz Duur. 

I was the Godswife of this Temple. 

My mother was Godswife 

here before me. 

She taught me how to make 

healing smokes and ointments. 

 i All men are of one flock   i  

 i so my people believe.  i  

The Great Shepherd sent me 

to Earth to heal his   

lamb or lion  

his wound must be 

washed and sewn 

 i or it will fester.  i  

For  years 

I ve been making corpses 

out of men  boy. 

I m the man you want 

leading the Vanguard. 

Galbart Glover 

will lead the Van. 

The bloody Wall will melt 

before an Umber marches 

behind a Glover. 

 i I  i  will lead the Van 

or I will take my men 

and march them home. 

You are welcome 

to do so  Lord Umber. 

And when I am done 

with the Lannisters 

I will march back North  

root you out of your Keep 

and hang you 

for an oathbreaker. 

Oathbreaker  is it   

I ll not sit here 

and swallow insults 

from a boy so green 

he pisses grass. 

My Lord father taught me 

it was death to bare steel 

 i against your Liege Lord.  i  

But doubtless the Greatjon only meant 

to cut my meat for me. 

Your meat... 

is bloody tough. 

  What is it  What s happened  

  Shh  it s all right. 

  Where are you going  

  South. For father. 

But it s the middle 

of the night. 

The Lannisters have 

spies everywhere. 

I don t want them 

to know we re coming. 

They have 

more men than we do. 

Aye  they do. 

Can t I come with you  

I can ride now. 

You ve seen me riding. 

And I won t get 

in the way  I   

There must always be 

a Stark at Winterfell. 

Until I return 

that will be you. 

You are not to leave the castle walls 

while we are gone. Do you understand  

Listen to Maester Luwin. 

Look after your little brother. 

I will. 

I ll send letters 

whenever I can  

but if you don t 

hear from me  

don t be scared. 

Until I return. 

How long have you been 

hiding out there  

Robb will be looking for you 

to say goodbye. 

They ve all gone away. 

They ll be back soon. 

Robb will free father 

and they ll come back 

with mother. 

No  they won t. 

 i Please watch  i  

 i over Robb.  i  

And watch over all the 

other men from Winterfell. 

And Theon too  

I suppose. 

You hear them  boy  

The Old Gods are 

answering you. 

What are you 

doing here  

They re my Gods too. 

Beyond the Wall  

they re the only Gods. 

Even slaves 

are allowed to pray. 

You re not a slave. 

Well  your friend did 

put a knife to my throat. 

I m not complaining  

Little Lord  

just telling truths. 

What did you mean 

about hearing the Gods  

You asked them  

they re answering you. 

Shh. 

Open your ears. 

It s only the wind. 

Who do you think 

sends the wind 

if not the Gods  

They see you  boy. 

 i They hear you.  i  

Your brother will get no help 

from them where he s going. 

The Old Gods have 

no power in the South. 

The Weirwoods there were 

all cut down a long time ago. 

How can they watch 

when they have no eyes  

Well  there s a big man. 

He has giants  blood 

in him or I m the Queen. 

Go back and find 

your clothes  Hodor. 

 i Go dress.  i  

Hodor. 

Are there really giants 

beyond the Wall  

Giants 

and worse than giants. 

I tried telling 

your brother  

he s marching 

the wrong way. 

All these swords  

they should be going North  boy. 

North  not south  

The cold winds are rising. 

They were touched 

by White Walkers. 

That s why 

they came back. 

That s why their eyes 

turned blue. 

Only fire will 

stop them. 

How do you know that  

I read about it 

in a book   

a very old book 

in Maester Aemon s library. 

What else 

did the book say  

The White Walkers 

sleep beneath the ice 

for thousands of years. 

And when they wake up   

And when they 

wake up  what  

I hope The Wall 

is high enough. 

Summer snows  My Lady. 

Robb s brought 

the North with him. 

The River Lords 

are falling back 

with Jaime Lannister 

at their heels. 

And Lord Tywin is bringing around a 

second Lannister army from the South. 

Our scouts confirm it s even larger 

than the Kingslayer s. 

One army or two  

the Kings in the North 

threw back hosts 

 times as large. 

Mother  

You look well. 

Lady Catelyn  you re a welcome 

sight in these troubled times. 

We had not thought 

to meet you here  My Lady. 

I had not thought 

to be here. 

I would speak 

with my son alone. 

I know you will 

forgive me  My Lords. 

You heard her  

Move your asses  

Come on  out. 

You too  Greyjoy. 

Are you bloody deaf  

Have no fear  My Lady. 

 i We ll shove our swords  i  

 i up Tywin Lannister s bunghole  i  

and then it s on to the Red Keep 

to free Ned. 

  You old devil  Rodrik. 

  Jon. 

You re not 

wasting away  are you  

I remember the day 

you came into this world 

red faced and squalling. 

And now I find you 

leading a host to war. 

  There was no one else. 

  No one  

Who were those men 

I saw here  

  None of them are Starks. 

  All of them are seasoned in battle. 

If you think you can send me back 

to Winterfell   

Oh  would that I could. 

There was... 

a letter. 

From Sansa. 

From the Queen  

you mean. 

  There s no mention of Arya. 

  No. 

How many men 

do you have  

 . 

If I go to King s Landing 

and bend my knee to Joffrey   

you would never 

be allowed to leave. No. 

Our best hope   

our only hope   

is that you can defeat 

them in the field. 

And if I lose  

Do you know what happened 

to the Targaryen children 

  when the Mad King fell  

  They were butchered in their sleep. 

On the orders 

of Tywin Lannister. 

And the years have 

not made him kinder. 

If you lose  

your father dies  

your sisters die  

 i we  i  die. 

Well  that makes it 

simple then. 

I suppose it does. 

From here it might be best if 

Bronn and I continue alone. 

Best for Tyrion 

son of Tywin. 

Not best for me. 

If the half man betrays us  

Shagga Son of Dolf 

will cut off his manhood   

and feed it 

to the goats  yes. 

All right then. 

Time to meet my father. 

  Tyrion. 

  Uncle. 

Father. 

The rumors of your demise 

were unfounded. 

Sorry 

to disappoint you. 

And who are these... 

 i Companions  i  of yours  

This is Shagga 

Son of Dolf  

 i Chieftain  i  

 i of the Stone Crows.  i  

 i Timett Son of Timett   i  

 i ruler of the Burned Men.  i  

 i This fair maid is  i  

 i Chella daughter of Cheyk   i  

 i leader  i  

 i of the Black Ears.  i  

And here we have 

Bronn son of... 

You wouldn t know him. 

May I present 

My Lord Father  

Tywin son of Tytos 

of House Lannister  

 i Lord of Casterly Rock  i  

 i and Warden of the West   i  

Kind of you 

to go to war for me. 

You left us no choice. 

The honor of the House 

was at stake. 

Your brother would never have 

submitted to capture so meekly. 

We have our differences  

Jaime and I. 

He s braver. 

I m better looking. 

He s been covering himself 

in glory. 

Jaime smashed the River Lords 

at the Golden Tooth  

and now lays siege to Riverrun  

Catelyn Stark s homeland. 

And the Starks  

Lord Eddard  

  Is our hostage. He will lead 

no armies from his dungeon cell. 

How did my sweet sister 

persuade the King 

to imprison 

his dear friend Ned  

Robert Baratheon is dead. 

Joffrey rules in King s Landing. 

My sister rules  

you mean. 

Stark s son has 

called his banners. 

  He moves south with a strong host. 

  A green boy. 

One taste of battle 

and he ll run 

back to Winterfell 

wi his tail between his legs. 

Maybe. 

Though the boy does have 

a certain belligerence. 

You d like him. 

While we re on 

the subject of war  

I made promises 

to my friends here 

and a Lannister 

always pays his debts. 

 i We shall require  i  

 i   helms and shields   i  

plus swords  pikes  

gorgets  maces   

if it please My Lord  

Ser Addam bids me report 

that the Northmen 

have crossed the neck. 

The wolf rushes 

into the lion s jaws. 

So be it. Kevan  command the 

drummers beat assembly. 

And send word to Jaime that 

I am moving against Robb Stark. 

At once  My Lord. 

It is said that the men of the 

Mountain clans are great warriors. 

Ride with me 

against my enemies 

and you shall have all 

my son promised you and more. 

Only if the half man 

fights with us. 

Until we hold the steel 

he pledged us  

the little lion s 

life is ours. 

 i The scouts report  i  

 i Lord Tywin moves north.  i  

We need to get him 

on broken ground  

put his Knights 

at a disadvantage. 

No  we need to get 

around him 

and break Jaime Lannister s 

siege of Riverrun. 

Do that and the River Lords 

will join us. 

To do either we need to cross 

the river 

and the only crossing 

is at The Twins. 

 i Lord Frey controls  i  

 i that bridge.  i  

Your father s bannerman. 

 The late Lord Frey  

my father calls him. 

At the Trident  he didn t appear 

until the battle was done. 

Some men takes their oaths 

more seriously than others. 

Robb s right. 

We need that bridge. 

So what s it going to be  

Do we move against 

Jaime or Lord Tywin  

Your pardon  my lords. 

 i We ve captured  i  

 i a Lannister scout.  i  

Don t worry  lad. He won t b 

leaving this tent with his head. 

Where did you find him  

In the brush above 

the encampment. 

 i He looked to be counting.  i  

How high did you get  

 . 

Maybe more. 

You don t have 

to do this yourself. 

Your father 

would understand   

My father unrstands mercy  

when there is room for it. 

And he understands honor... 

and courage. 

Let him go. 

Robb. 

Tell Lord Tywin 

Winter is coming for him. 

  Northerners marching south 

to find out if he really does shit gold. 

Yes  My Lord. 

Thank you  My Lord. 

Are you touched  boy   

Letting him go  

You call me boy again. 

Go on. 

Oi. 

 i It is also the wish  i  

 i of His Grace  i  

 i that his loyal servant  i  

 i Janos Slynt   i  

   i Commander of the City Watch...  i  

  Ser Aron. 

 i ...Be at once raised  i  

 i to the rank of Lord...  i  

  Lord Gyles. 

   i ...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal   i  

 i and that his sons and grandsons  i  

 i shall hold this honor  i  

 i after him  i  

 i until the end of time.  i  

In the place of the traitor 

Eddard Stark  

 i it is the wish of his Grace  i  

 i that Tywin Lannister   i  

 i Lord of Casterly Rock  i  

 i and Warden of the West   i  

 i be appointed  i  

 i Hand of the King.  i  

Lastly  

in these times 

of treason and turmoil  

 i it is the view  i  

 i of the Council  i  

that the life and safety 

of King Joffrey 

be of paramount importance. 

Ser Barristan Selmy. 

Your Grace  I am 

yours to command. 

Rise  Ser Barristan. 

You may remove 

your helm. 

 i You have served the Realm  i  

 i long and faithfully.  i  

 i Every man and woman in the  i  

 i Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.  i  

But it is time to put aside 

your armor and your sword. 

 i It is time to rest  i  

 i and look back with pride  i  

on your many years 

of service. 

Your Grace  the Kingsguard 

is a sworn brotherhood. 

 i Our vows are  i  

 i taken for life.  i  

Only death relieves us 

of our sacred trust. 

Whose death  Ser Barristan  

Yours or your King s  

 i You let my father die.  i  

You re too old 

to protect anybody. 

  Your Grace   

  The Council has determined 

that Ser Jaime Lannister 

will take your place 

 i as Lord Commander  i  

 i of the Kingsguard.  i  

The man who 

profaned his blade 

with the blood of the King 

he had sworn to defend  

Careful  Ser. 

We have nothing 

but gratitude 

for your long service  

good Ser. 

You shall be given 

a stout Keep beside the sea  

with servants 

to look after your every need. 

A hall to die in 

 i and men to bury me.  i  

I am a Knight. 

I shall die a Knight. 

A naked Knight  

apparently. 

Even now I could cut through 

the five of you like carving a cake  

Here  boy  

Melt it down and add it 

to the others. 

If any man in this hall 

has other matters 

to set before His Grace  

let him speak now 

or go forth and hold 

his silence. 

Your Grace. 

Come forward  

My Lady. 

 i The Lady Sansa  i  

 i of House Stark.  i  

Do you have some business for 

the King and the Council  Sansa  

I do. 

As it please Your Grace  

I ask mercy for my father  

Lord Eddard Stark  

who was Hand of the King. 

Treason is a noxious weed. 

  It should be torn out  root   

  Let her speak. 

I want to hear 

what she says. 

Thank you  Your Grace. 

Do you deny 

your father s crime  

No  My Lords. 

I know he must be punished. 

All I ask is mercy. 

 i I know My Lord father  i  

 i must regret what he did.  i  

He was King Robert s friend 

and he loved him. 

You all know he loved him. 

He never wanted to be Hand 

until the King asked him. 

They must have lied to him   

Lord Renly or Lord Stannis 

or somebody. 

They must have lied  

He said 

I wasn t the King. 

Why did he say that  

He was badly hurt. 

Maester Pycelle was giving 

him milk of the poppy. 

He wasn t himself. Otherwise h 

never would have said it. 

A child s faith... 

Such sweet innocence. 

 i And yet they say  i  

 i wisdom oft comes  i  

from the mouths of babes. 

Treason 

is treason  

Anything else  

If you still have any affection 

in your heart for me  

please do me 

this kindness  Your Grace. 

Your sweet words 

have moved me. 

But your father has 

to confess. 

He has to confess 

and say that I m the King... 

Or there ll be 

no mercy for him. 

He will. 

You did this. 

You did this  

  We have to leave. 

  Cersei  i  Take him  Take him   i  

Where is his wife  

Where s Sansa  

Find her. 

Bar the gates of the city. 

 i Seize every ship in the harbor.  i  

  Where is she   

  No one leaves the capital  

 i No one   i  

 i   bells tolling    i  

  Get in. 

  Where are we going  

Somewhere safe. 

Up you go  my lady. 

You ll be fine. 

You re stronger than you know. 

  gasps   

  Lord Baelish  

  Petyr. 

Are you hurt  my lady  

Good. Good. 

I m sure you ve had quite a fright. 

Rest easy. 

  The worst is past. 

  Dontos  i  Lord Baelish.  i  

  i  I promised I d get her to you safely.  i  

  Softly  my friend. 

Voices carry over water. 

I should get back before 

someone thinks to look for me. 

First you ll want your pay. 

    was it  

   . 

  snaps fingers   

Wait  

  groans   

  screams   

Littlefinger   i  Shh.  i  

You don t want the 

queen to hear  do you  

  gold cloaks 

are searching for you. 

And if they found you  

how do you think they would punish 

the girl who murdered the king  

  I didn t murder anyone. 

  I know. I know. 

But you must admit 

it looks suspicious. 

The king who 

executed your father  

who tormented you for years  

and you fled the scene 

of his murder. 

Why did you kill him  

Because he was 

a drunk and a fool 

and I don t trust drunk fools. 

He saved me. 

Saved you  My lady  

he followed my orders. 

Every one of them. 

And he did it all for gold. 

 i Money buys a man s  i  

 i silence for a time.  i  

A bolt in the heart 

buys it forever. 

He was helping me 

because I saved his life. 

Yes  and he gave you 

a priceless necklace 

that once belonged 

to his grandmother. 

The last legacy 

of House Hollard. 

I had it made a few weeks ago. 

What did I once tell 

you about the capital  

We re all liars here. 

Come  my lady. 

I know you ve had 

a difficult day. 

But you re safe now. 

I promise you that. 

You re safe with me 

and sailing home. 

So am I the queen  

More than you were with Renly. 

Less than you would have been if 

Joffrey had done you the courtesy 

of consummating 

the marriage before dying. 

In any case  this would 

not be an opportune moment 

to press the issue. 

Clawing at his own throat  

looking to his mother to make 

it stop   it was horrible. 

The world is overflowing 

with horrible things. 

But they re all a tray 

of cakes next to death. 

They brought me your grandfather s 

body when he died  you know  

Made me look at it. 

What was it like  

They took me to the Great 

Hall and there he was. 

The man I d married 

and suffered to father 

my children. 

A great doughy lump 

I d sat next to 

at endless dinners 

and tedious gatherings. 

There he was... 

lying on a table. 

One of my husbands 

preferred the company of men 

and was stabbed 

through the heart. 

Another was happiest 

torturing animals 

and was poisoned 

at our wedding feast. 

  I must be cursed. 

  Nonsense. 

Your circumstances 

have improved markedly. 

You may not have enjoyed 

watching him die  

but you enjoyed it more 

than you would have enjoyed 

being married to him  

I can promise you that. 

But I would have been the queen. 

Our alliance with the Lannisters 

remains every bit 

as necessary to them 

as it is unpleasant for us. 

You did wonderful 

work on Joffrey. 

The next one should be easier. 

Tywin  

 i Your brother is dead.  i  

Do you know what that means  

I m not trying to trick you. 

It means I ll become king. 

Yes  you will become king. 

What kind of king 

do you think you ll be  

A good king  

Mm  I think so as well. 

You ve got the right 

temperament for it. 

 i But what makes  i  

 i a good king  Hmm   i  

What is a good king s single 

most important quality  

This is hardly 

the place or the time. 

Holiness  

Hmm. 

 i Baelor the Blessed was holy.  i  

And pious. 

He built this sept. 

He also named a six year old 

boy high septon 

because he thought the boy 

could work miracles. 

He ended up fasting 

himself into an early grave 

because food was of this world 

and this world was sinful. 

Justice. 

Yeah. 

A good king must be just. 

Orys I was just. 

Everyone applauded his reforms. 

Nobles and commoners alike. 

But he wasn t just for long. 

He was murdered in his sleep 

after less than a year 

by his own brother. 

Was that truly just of him  

To abandon his subjects 

to an evil 

that he was too gullible 

to recognize  

  No. 

  No. 

  What about strength  

  Yes. 

Strength. 

King Robert was strong. 

He won the rebellion 

and crushed 

the Targaryen dynasty. 

And he attended three 

small council meetings 

in  years. 

 i He spent his time whoring 

and hunting and drinking  i  

until the last two killed him. 

 i So  we have a man who 

starves himself to death   i  

a man who lets his own 

brother murder him  

and a man who thinks that winning 

and ruling are the same thing. 

What do they all lack  

  Wisdom. 

  Yes  

Wisdom is what 

makes a good king. 

Yes. 

But what is wisdom  

Hmm  

 i A house with great wealth  i  

 i and fertile lands  i  

 i asks you for your protection  i  

against another house 

with a strong navy 

that could one day oppose you. 

How do you know which choice 

is wise and which isn t  

You ve any experience 

of treasuries and granaries 

 i or shipyards and soldiers   i  

  No. 

  i  No. Of course not.  i  

A wise king knows what he 

knows and what he doesn t. 

You re young. 

 i A wise young king listens  i  

 i to his counselors  i  

and heeds their advice 

until he comes of age. 

And the wisest kings 

continue to listen to them 

long afterwards. 

Your brother was not 

a wise king. 

 i Your brother was not  i  

 i a good king.  i  

 i If he had been   i  

perhaps he d still be alive. 

Now  as the king  

you will have to marry. 

Do you understand why  

Tommen  

 i A king needs a queen.  i  

Tywin  

 i Yes  but why   i  

To further the family line. 

  i  Do you know how that happens   i  

  Yes. 

Yes  but has anyone explained 

the details to you  

I don t think so. 

It s all relatively 

straightforward. 

  How are you  

  I m all right. 

You are. 

You will be. 

I ll see to that. 

Please give the queen 

a moment alone with her son. 

  Yes  my lord. 

  All of you. 

  snaps fingers   

  doors echo shut   

It was Tyrion. 

He killed him. 

He told me he would. 

 A day will come when you 

think you are safe and happy 

and your joy will turn 

to ashes in your mouth.  

That s what he said to me. 

You saw it. 

You saw Joff point at him 

just before he   

I don t know what I saw. 

Avenge him. 

Avenge our son. 

Kill Tyrion. 

Tyrion s my brother. 

 i Our brother.  i  

There ll be a trial. We ll get 

to the truth of what happened. 

I don t want a trial. 

He ll squirm his way to 

freedom given the chance. 

I want him dead. 

  crying   

Please  Jaime. 

You have to. 

He was our son. 

Our baby boy. 

  gasps   

You re a hateful woman. 

Why have the gods made 

me love a hateful woman  

Jaime  not here  please. 

Please. 

    fabric rips   

  Stop it. 

  Stop it. Stop. 

  No. 

Stop it. 

Stop. 

Stop. 

  Stop. It s not right. 

    Grunts   

It s not right. 

It s not right. 

  I don t care. 

    Crying   

  Don t. 

  I don t care. 

  Don t. Jaime  don t. 

  I don t care. 

 i   thunder rumbles    i  

Gonna rain soon. 

  urinating   

Where are we  

Near Fairmarket  I think. 

You think  

You don t have a map  

   i  No  I don t have a map.  i  

  Maybe we should get one. 

Just point out the next map shop 

you see and I ll buy you one. 

How far is it to the Eyrie  

  Far. 

  And you re sure we re going the right way  

Believe me  girl  I want you 

there as soon as I can. 

Get my gold  be on my way. 

  On your way where  

  Why do you care  

Might book passage

 i Fight as a sellsword.  i  

Second Sons  could be. 

Seems like a good fit for me. 

I d like to see Braavos one day. 

Why Braavos  

I have friends there. 

  blows   

I doubt it. 

Seven blessings to you. 

  What do you want  

  What do I want  This is my land. 

If I m standing on it  

it s my land. 

We were just watering the horses. 

We ll be on our way. 

Forgive my father. 

 i He was wounded fighting  i  

 i in the war.  i  

Our cottage burned down while he 

was gone and my mother with it. 

He s never been the same. 

Which house did he fight for  

The Tullys of Riverrun. 

There s a storm coming. 

 i You ll be wanting  i  

 i a roof tonight.  i  

 i There s fresh hay in the barn.  i  

And Sally here makes rabbit stew 

just like her mom used to do. 

We don t have much  

but any man that bled 

for House Tully 

is welcome to it. 

   i    thunder rumbling    i  

   i    Rain pattering    i  

Man   i  We ask the Father 

to judge us with mercy  i  

 i accepting our human frailty.  i  

 i We ask the Mother  i  

 i to bless our crops  i  

so we may feed ourselves 

and all who come to our door. 

 i We ask the Warrior  i  

 i to give us courage  i  

in these days of strife 

and turmoil. 

We ask the Maiden 

to protect Sally s virtue 

to keep her from 

the clutches of depravity. 

You got to do 

all seven of the fuckers  

Father  

We ask the Smith 

to strengthen our hands 

and our backs so we may finish 

the work required of us. 

We ask the Crone to guide us on our 

journey from darkness to darkness. 

And we ask the Stranger 

not to kill us 

in our beds tonight 

for no damn reason at all. 

I m so sorry. 

  slurping loudly   

Really good. 

  Did you fight at the Twins  

  Call that a fight  

Slaughtering livestock 

more like. 

The Red Wedding 

they re calling it. 

Walder Frey committed 

sacrilege that day. 

He shared bread and salt with the Starks. 

He offered them guest right. 

Guest right 

don t mean much anymore. 

It means something to me. 

The gods will have 

their vengeance. 

Frey will burn in the seventh 

hell for what he did. 

Things were different when Hoster 

Tully ruled the Riverlands. 

We had good years and bad 

years  same as anyone. 

But we were safe. 

Now with the Freys  

raiders come plundering  steal 

our food  steal our silver. 

I was gonna send Sally north 

to stay with my brother  

but the north s no better. 

The whole country s gone sour. 

You got any ale  

Afraid not. 

How can a man 

not keep ale in his home  

You look like you could 

really swing that sword. 

 i A real warrior  i  

 i with proper training.  i  

Those raiders wouldn t 

stand a chance against you. 

 i How would it be if you stayed  i  

 i on till the new moon   i  

I could use a man to help 

with the farmwork. 

Sally does what she can  

but she can t lift 

a bale of hay. 

And if any thieves came 

looking for easy pickings  

one look at you  I d bet 

they d run the other way. 

Meaning no offense. 

What ll you pay  

I don t have much. 

But I have hidden a bit of 

silver from the bandits. 

Fair wages for fair work  

Fair wages for fair work.

  What did you do   

   i  Get your horse saddled.  i  

  You told me you weren t a thief. 

  I wasn t. 

He took us in. 

He fed us and you   

Aye  he took us in. 

He s a good man 

and his daughter makes 

a nice stew. 

And they ll both 

be dead come winter. 

  You don t know that. 

  I do know it. 

He s weak. 

He can t protect himself. 

They ll both be dead 

come winter. 

Dead men don t need silver. 

You re the worst shit 

in the Seven Kingdoms. 

There s plenty worse than me. 

I just understand 

the way things are. 

How many Starks they got to 

behead before you figure it out

Horse thief. 

Ninth born son. 

Raper.

Thief and raper. 

There he is  Sam the Slayer. 

Going to visit 

your wildling whore  

  She s not a whore. 

  No  

Maybe I ll give her a copper 

tonight and find out. 

They all think I m lying. 

About what  

Killing the white walker. 

You re not lying. 

I ll never forget 

the way it screamed. 

But you re the only one 

that saw it. 

And they all think 

you re just a   

A what  

Well  a wildling. 

My father hated that word. 

It s not a very nice word  

I suppose. 

I don t know. 

It makes me sound a bit 

dangerous  doesn t it  

So... 

are you all right  

No one bothering you  

I get a lot of looks. 

I hear them making their jokes. 

But no one s touched me 

if that s what you mean. 

I worry about it sometimes. 

All the time. 

Why do you worry about it  

 men  one woman. 

I ve got other things 

to think about. 

That s the only thing 

they think about. 

  You re being silly. 

  I m not being silly. 

There s  men lying awake 

at night picturing you. 

What about you  

What about me  

Gilly  

I worry about you. 

Thank you. 

For what  

For worrying about me. 

I don t know 

if you re safe here. 

They re my brothers  

but some of them were thieves 

before they came here. 

Some of them were rapers. 

You saw what they did 

at your father s keep. 

So what are you saying  

Maybe you d be safer 

in Mole s Town. 

Are you bored of me  

Bored of you  

I... 

I want to protect you. 

I ll get these to Hobb. 

Keep an eye on little Sam. 

 i   door closes    i  

 i   thunder rumbling    i  

Your Grace. 

You re a literary man now. 

What do you make of that  

  Joffrey  

  The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. 

 i I said those words when I 

tossed a leech into the fire.  i  

A leech filled with 

bastard blood. 

A bastard you set free. 

I am now faced with 

a great opportunity 

and I am powerless 

to take advantage of it. 

I will find you 

an army  Your Grace. 

  I ve been working day and night   

  What progress have you made  

I ve rallied House Peasebury 

to your cause. 

House Peasebury. 

  House Musgood. 

  House Musgood. 

  And House Haigh. 

  House Haigh. 

 i   pieces clatter    i  

They don t have enough men 

between them to raid a pantry. 

Westeros is not 

the world  Your Grace. 

We need to look east 

for ships and men. 

  skilled soldiers 

fight for the Golden Company. 

  The Golden Company  

  They ve never broken a contract. 

They re sellswords. 

We re willing to use blood magic 

to put you on the throne  

but we re not willing 

to pay men to fight  

Now the Red Woman s 

magic is real. 

Her visions and prophecies 

may be  too  

but I ve never heard of visions 

and prophecies winning a war. 

Soldiers win wars. 

Soldiers on the ground. 

It s dirty on the ground. 

We don t have any gold. 

Not yet. 

If I do not press my claim  

my claim will be forgotten. 

I will not become a page in 

someone else s history book. 

I m running out 

of time  Ser Davos. 

Which means you re 

running out of time. 

 i   knocking    i  

You re late. 

I m sorry  Princess. 

I thought you weren t coming. 

The Hand of the King doesn t 

have much leisure time. 

You won t be a very good Hand if you see 

the word knight and say  ka nigit.  

That happened once  weeks ago. 

You re your father s 

daughter  no mistake. 

Bloody relentless  

the both of you. 

It s a new one today. 

Lots of tricky words. 

But I think you can manage. 

You ll never read well 

if you move your lips. 

That s how children do it. 

 The Life and Adventures 

of Elyo Grivas 

First Sword of Braavos.  

    claps   

  Thank you very much. 

I like this one. It s full 

of sword fights and pirates. 

You were a pirate once. 

No  I was never a pirate. 

I was a smuggler. 

What s the difference  

Well  if you re 

a famous smuggler  

you re not doing it right. 

My father says 

a criminal is a criminal. 

Your father lacks 

an appreciation 

of the finer points 

of bad behavior. 

So do the Braavosi. 

  You ve sailed to Braavos  

  Of course. 

Almost got beheaded 

by a First Sword of Braavos. 

I tried to explain to him the difference 

between pirates and smugglers  

but he didn t seem any more interested 

in the distinction than your father. 

I suppose if you work 

for the Iron Bank of Braavos 

and each one of your gold 

barges is worth half a kingdom  

you tend not to be overly concerned 

with the kind of distinction   

  What was that for  

  I need you to write a message. 

You should write it yourself. 

It s good practice. 

It s too important for me. 

I need a smart person 

to do it. Go on. 

To the offices 

of the Iron Bank of Braavos 

from Stannis Baratheon the 

one true king of Westeros. 

But that s not you. 

I need to get their attention. 

Go on. Write. 

  baby cooing   

He s seen some 

adventures  hasn t he  

 i   people laughing  chatting    i  

  Precious little thing. 

  Thank you. 

  What s his name  

  Sam. 

Lovely. 

That the daddy  

No. 

Where s the daddy  

He s dead. 

Oh. Where you from  

North of here. 

North of here  

You a fucking wildling  

  Only room and board  

  That s right. 

She ll clean and cook 

and look after the other 

girls  babies. 

Could find other 

work for her  too. 

  No other work. 

  There d be money. 

Give you a piece of it. 

No other work. 

I promise to come back 

and visit whenever I can. 

You ll be safer here. 

Who s gonna protect you 

at Castle Black  Me  

You protected me 

north of the Wall. 

This is different. 

They re brothers 

of the Night s Watch 

and I can t just stab 

them in the back 

and I can t run away  which 

is what we did at Craster s. 

  baby crying   

You have to trust me. 

It s for the best. 

Best for you. 

Oh  Gilly. 

Please don t. 

  baby crying   

  moaning   

Greedy. 

No  

I m sorry. 

You re lovely  

I just never acquired the taste. 

You re calling my beauty 

an acquired taste  

That s quite all right  lover. 

It s more for you. 

Your loss. 

You like them both the same  

  Boys and girls  

  Does that surprise you  

Everyone has a preference. 

Then everyone is missing 

half the world s pleasure. 

 i The gods made that  i  

 i and it delights me.  i  

The gods made this 

and it delights me. 

When it comes to war  

I fight for Dorne. 

When it comes to love  

I don t choose sides. 

I hope I have as much 

stamina when I m your age. 

What are you    

  Children. 

    Chuckles   

Someday  if you re lucky  

you will wake up 

and realize you are old. 

That pretty ass 

of yours will sag. 

Your belly will grow soft and 

your back will ache in the night 

and gray hairs will sprout 

from your ears. 

 i No one will want you anymore.  i  

Make sure you fucked 

your fill before that day. 

Did you  

He is a prince of Dorne. 

Girls and boys will line up 

to fuck him 

till the day he dies. 

They will all have 

to line up behind you. 

 i   door opens    i  

   i  Prince Oberyn.  i  

  Lord Tywin. 

May we have the room  

Call my name 

if you need me  lover. 

Would you like to sit  

No  thank you. 

Some wine  

 i No  thank you.  i  

 i   door closes    i  

  I m sorry about your grandson. 

  Are you  

I don t believe that a child is 

responsible for the sins of his father. 

Or his grandfather. 

An awful way to die. 

Which way is that  

Are you interrogating 

me  Lord Tywin  

Some believe the king choked. 

Some believe the sky 

is blue because we live 

inside the eye 

of a blue eyed giant. 

The king was poisoned. 

I hear you studied 

poisons at the Citadel. 

I did. 

This is why I know. 

Your hatred for my family 

is rather well known. 

You arrive at the capital  

an expert in poisoning  

some days later my grandson 

dies of poisoning. 

Rather suspicious. 

Why haven t you thrown 

me in a dungeon  

You spoke with Tyrion 

in this very brothel 

on the day that you arrived. 

What did you discuss  

You think we conspired together  

What did you discuss  

The death of my sister. 

For which you blame me. 

She was raped and murdered 

by the Mountain. 

The Mountain follows 

your orders. 

Of course I blame you. 

Here I stand unarmed  unguarded. 

Should I be concerned  

You are unarmed and unguarded because 

you know me better than that. 

I am a man of reason. 

If I cut your throat today  

I will be drawn 

and quartered tomorrow. 

Men at war commit 

all kinds of crimes 

without their 

superiors  knowledge. 

So you deny involvement 

in Elia s murder  

Categorically. 

I would like to speak 

with the Mountain. 

I m sure he would enjoy 

speaking with you. 

He might not enjoy it as 

much as he thinks he would. 

I could arrange 

for this meeting. 

But you want 

something in return. 

There will be a trial 

for my son. 

And as custom dictates  

three judges 

will render a verdict. 

I will preside. 

Mace Tyrell will serve 

as the second judge. 

I would like you 

to be the third. 

Why  

Not long ago  the Tyrells 

sided with Renly Baratheon. 

Declared themselves 

enemies of the throne. 

Now they are 

our strongest allies. 

Well  you made 

the Tyrell girl a queen. 

Asking me to judge at your son s 

trial isn t quite as tempting. 

I will also invite you 

to sit on the small council 

to serve as one of the new 

king s principal advisors. 

I never realized you had such 

respect for Dorne  Lord Tywin. 

We are not the Seven Kingdoms 

until Dorne returns to the fold. 

The king is dead. The Greyjoys 

are in open rebellion. 

A wildling army 

marches on the Wall. 

And in the East  a Targaryen 

girl has three dragons. 

Before long  she will 

turn her eyes to Westeros. 

Only the Dornish 

managed to resist 

Aegon Targaryen and his dragons. 

You re saying you need us  

That must be hard 

for you to admit. 

We need each other. 

You help me serve justice 

to the king s assassins 

and I will help you 

serve justice to Elia s. 

 i   door unlocks    i  

Podrick. 

Apologies for the stench. 

I brought you some wine  my 

lord  but they took it from me. 

A noble effort. 

They didn t find 

the candles  though. 

A quill  some parchment  

duck sausage  almonds  

and some hard cheese. 

You re a good lad. 

Any word of Shae  

I ve heard nothing  my lord. 

I suppose that s a good thing. 

What are they saying 

about me out there  

You re to stand trial 

in a fortnight 

for murdering the king. 

Do you believe 

I murdered Joffrey  

No  my lord. 

You didn t  

No. Gods  no. 

The world is a better 

place without him  

but I had nothing to do with it. 

I would like to think 

if I were arranging 

a royal assassination  

I d plan it in such a way that 

I wouldn t be standing there 

gawking like a fool 

when the king died. 

Trial in a fortnight. 

 i Have they announced  i  

 i the judges yet   i  

  Your father. 

  Of course. 

Mace Tyrell. 

Who will vote exactly as my 

father tells him to vote. 

And Prince Oberyn of Dorne. 

Oberyn  

Give it to my father. 

He never fails to take 

advantage of a family tragedy. 

I m supposed to get a list 

of names from you  my lord. 

Anyone who might testify 

on your behalf. 

Oh  I can call my own witnesses  

 i How generous of them.  i  

Very well  my wife. 

Sansa. 

My lord  she s gone. 

  Gone  

  i  No one s seen her since the wedding.  i  

You don t think she... 

 i No one had more cause  i  

 i to kill Joffrey than Sansa   i  

but the girl is no assassin. 

Whoever killed the king wanted 

me to lose my head for it. 

And with my wife s disappearance  it 

makes me seem that much more guilty. 

  Podrick. 

  Yes  my lord  

  They ll be following you now. 

  Who will  

I don t know. They. 

They. The ominous they. 

The man pulling the strings. 

Or woman. My father. 

Maybe Joffrey 

was too much work for him. 

Sweet Tommen will be 

so much easier to handle. 

Whenever something 

bad happens to me  

I assume it s my sister 

that had a hand in it. 

 i But say what you will of Cersei   i  

she loves her children. 

She is the only one I m certain had 

nothing to do with this murder. 

Which makes it unique 

as King s Landing murders go. 

Any other witnesses  my lord  

Varys could vouch 

for me if he dared. 

He s already been called 

as a witness for the queen. 

Of course. Fetch Bronn. 

I have a job for him. 

I ve already asked  my lord. 

  They won t let him see you. 

  Why not  

They say he s a known cutthroat 

and your close associate. 

He s under 

investigation himself. 

And my brother  Will they at 

least allow me to see Jaime  

I ll ask  my lord. 

There s something else  my lord. 

A man  I didn t know his face  

he came to ask if 

I d testify against you. 

Said I d be named 

Ser Podrick Payne 

if I told the judges you d bought 

a poison called the Strangler. 

Ser Podrick Payne  

Has a nice ring to it. 

What did you tell him  

I didn t tell them 

anything  my lord. 

Are you going to 

accept their offer  

My lord. 

Testifying against me 

wasn t a suggestion. 

If they can t 

tempt you with honey  

they ll choose something 

less sweet. 

You ve been good to me  my lord. 

Pod  the trial s in a fortnight. 

They ll want an answer 

before that. 

I already gave them 

an answer  my lord. 

I will not have you 

dying on my behalf. 

Do you hear me  

If I have to take 

that long walk to 

the executioner s block  

I don t want to see 

your head already mounted. 

  My lord. 

  Pod  I am giving you an order. 

Go and find my brother. 

Tell him I need him. 

And get yourself 

out of King s Landing 

before it s too late. 

Pod  

This is farewell. 

Farewell  my lord.

Do you hear me  

I m going to eat your dead mama 

and I m going to eat 

your dead papa. 

Go tell the crows 

at Castle Black. 

Yarwyck  i  We need to teach them a lesson 

about the way we deal with their kind.  i  

Men  

 i Aye  Aye   i  

Yarwyck   i  Three dozen 

bodies with slit throats  i  

 i tossed off the top of the Wall.  i  

  Seems like that would be a good lesson. 

  Aye  

If we go after them  we ll be 

giving them what they want. 

They want to draw us out  

pick us off a few at a time. 

We have just over  men. 

And that s including 

stewards and builders. 

And me. We can t afford 

to lose a single man. 

We must remember our 

first responsibility. 

We are the watchers on the Wall. 

There s got to be 

a way to protect them. 

You re a champion of the 

common people  Lord Snow. 

 i What do you say to  i  

 i Brother Pyp s proposition   i  

Mance Rayder is coming. 

If the wildlings 

breach the Wall  

they ll roll over everything 

and everyone for   miles 

before they reach an army 

that can stop them. 

We need to shore up Castle Black 

and we need to defend the Wall. 

 i That is our job.  i  

 i   horn blows    i  

Rangers returning. 

Help him. 

Thought you d have 

blue eyes by now. 

What took you so long  

  We were held up. 

  By what  

Chains. 

We were guests of the 

mutineers at Craster s Keep. 

  And the mutineers stayed  

  They re not going anywhere. 

They ve got Craster s food 

and his wives. 

Dolorous Edd  

 i Poor girls.  i  

Never thought they d 

miss their daddy. 

Karl s running things now. 

He s the one who put a knife 

through Craster s mouth. 

We need to ride north 

and kill them all. 

We just went over this  boy. 

  Justice can wait. 

  It s not about justice. 

I told the wildlings we had over 

  men at Castle Black alone. 

Karl and the others know 

the truth as well as we do. 

How long do you think they ll keep 

that information to themselves 

when the wildlings are peeling 

their fingernails off  

Mance has all he needs to crush 

us  he just doesn t know it yet. 

As soon as he gets 

his hands on them  he will. 

Then he ll throw 

his full strength at us. 

And even if every one 

of us kills  wildlings  

there s still not a thing 

we can do to stop them. 

I don t think I can 

kill  wildlings.

He claims you are no woman 

at all  but a man who... 

hides his cock 

in his own asshole. 

Ignore him  Your Grace. 

These are meaningless words. 

They re not meaningless if half the city 

you intend to take is listening to them. 

I have something to say 

to the people of Meereen. 

First  I will need 

this one to be quiet. 

Do I have a champion  

Your Grace  I ve won more single 

combats than any man alive. 

Which is why you must 

remain by my side. 

I ve been by your side longer 

than any of them  Khaleesi. 

Let me stand for you 

today as well. 

You are my most trusted advisor  

my most valued general  

and my dearest friend. 

I will not gamble 

with your life. 

Daario  I was the last 

to join your army. 

I m not your general or a 

member of your Queensguard 

or the commander 

of your Unsullied. 

My mother was a whore. 

I come from nothing. 

And before long  

I will return to nothing. 

Let me kill this man for you. 

Very well. 

You have quite an audience. 

Make it worth their while. 

He is very brave  Your Grace. 

Yes  win or lose  

 i as long as the whole  i  

 i city is watching.  i  

You sure you don t want a horse  

Daario   i  Why would 

I want a horse   i

I ve never seen wildlings 

do a thing like this. 

I never seen a thing like this  

not ever in my life. 

How close did you get  

  Close as any man would. 

  We should head back to the wall. 

Do the dead frighten you  

Our orders were 

to track the wildlings. 

We tracked them. 

They won t trouble us no more. 

You don t think 

he ll ask us how they died  

Get back on your horse. 

Whatever did it to them 

could do it to us. 

They even killed 

the children. 

It s a good thing 

we re not children. 

You want to run away south  

run away. 

Of course they will 

behead you as a deserter  

if I don t 

catch you first. 

Get back on your horse.

White Walkers. 

I saw the White Walkers. 

White Walkers. 

The White Walkers  

I saw them. 

I know I broke my oath. 

And I know 

I m a deserter. 

I should have gone back to the wall 

and warned them  but   

I saw what I saw. 

I saw the White Walkers. 

 i People need to know.  i  

If you can get word 

to my family... 

 i Tell them I m no coward.  i  

 i Tell them I m sorry.  i  

Forgive me  Lord. 

In the name of Robert

  Don t look away.

sentence you to die. 

You did well. 

You understand 

why I did it  

Jon said 

he was a deserter. 

But do you understand 

why  i i  i  had to kill him  

 Our way is the old way   

The man who passes 

the sentence 

should swing the sword. 

Is it true he saw 

the White Walkers  

The White Walkers have been 

gone for thousands of years. 

So he was lying  

A madman sees what he sees. 

What is it  

Mountain lion  

There are no Mountain lions 

in these woods. 

It s a freak  

It s a direwolf. 

Tough old beast. 

There are no direwolves 

south of the wall. 

Now there are five. 

You want to hold it  

Where will they go  

Their mother s dead. 

They don t belong 

down here. 

Better 

a quick death. 

They won t last 

without their mother. 

  Right. Give it here. 

  No  

Put away your blade. 

I take orders 

from your father  not you. 

  Please  father  

  I m sorry  Bran. 

Lord Stark  

There are 

five pups... 

one for each 

of the Stark children. 

The direwolf is the sigil of your House. 

They were meant 

to have them. 

You will train them 

yourselves. 

You will 

feed them yourselves. 

And if they die  

you will bury them yourselves. 

What about you  

I m not a Stark. 

Get on. 

What is it  

The runt of the litter   

that one s yours  snow. 

As your brother  

I feel it s my duty to warn you  

You worry too much. 

  It s starting to show. 

  And you never worry about anything. 

 i When we were seven  i  

 i and you jumped off  i  

 i the cliffs at Casterly Rock   i  

 foot drop into the water  

and you were never afraid. 

There was nothing to be afraid of 

until you told father. 

 We re lannisters. 

Lannisters 

don t act like fools.  

 i What if Jon Arryn  i  

 i told someone   i  

But who would he tell  

  My husband. 

  If he told the King  both our heads 

would be skewered 

on the city gates by now. 

Whatever Jon Arryn 

knew or didn t know  it died with him. 

And Robert will choose a new 

Hand of the King   someone to do his job 

while he s off fucking boars 

and hunting whores   

or is it 

the other way around  

And life will go on. 

You should be 

The Hand of the King. 

That s an honor 

I can do without. 

Their days are too long  

their lives are too short. 

All these years 

and I still feel 

like an outsider 

when I come here. 

You have five 

northern children. 

You re not an outsider. 

I wonder 

if the old gods agree. 

It s your gods 

with all the rules. 

I am so sorry  my love. 

  Tell me. 

  There was a raven from King s Landing. 

Jon Arryn is dead. 

 i A fever took him.  i  

 i I know he was like  i  

 i a father to you.  i  

   i Your sister  the boy   i  

  They both have their health  

 i gods be good.  i  

The raven 

brought more news... 

The King rides 

for Winterfell... 

with the Queen 

 i and all the rest  i  

 i of them.  i  

If he s coming 

this far north... 

There s only 

one thing he s after. 

You can always say no  Ned. 

We ll need plenty of candles 

for Lord Tyrion s chamber. 

I m told he reads 

all night. 

I m told he drinks 

all night. 

How much could he possibly drink  

A man of his... 

Stature  

We ve brought up 

eight barrels of ale from the cellar. 

  Perhaps we ll find out. 

  In any case  

 i candles.  i  

Why is your mother so dead set 

on us getting pretty for the King  

It s for the Queen  I bet. 

I hear she s a sleek bit of mink. 

I hear the prince 

is a right royal prick. 

Think of all those 

southern girls he gets to stab 

with his right 

royal prick. 

Go on  Tommy  

shear him good. 

He s never met a girl he likes better 

than his own hair. 

Gods  but they grow fast. 

Brandon  

I saw the king. 

He s got hundreds of people. 

How many times 

have I told you no climbing  

But he s coming right now   

down our road. 

I want you 

to promise me  

no more climbing. 

I promise. 

  Do you know what  

  What  

You always look 

at your feet before you lie. 

Run and find your father. 

Tell him the King is close. 

Where s Arya  

Sansa  where s your sister  

  Hey hey hey hey. 

  Ohh. 

What are you doing 

with that on  

Go on. 

Move  

Your Grace. 

You ve got fat. 

  Cat  

  Your Grace. 

Nine years   why haven t I seen you  

Where the hell have you been  

Guarding the north 

for you  your Grace. 

 i Winterfell is yours.  i  

  Where s the imp  

  Will you shut up  

Who have we here  

You must be Robb. 

My  you re 

a pretty one. 

Your name is  

Arya. 

Oh  show us 

your muscles. 

You ll be a soldier. 

 i That s Jaime Lannister   i  

 i the Queen s twin brother.  i  

 i Would you please shut up   i  

My Queen. 

My Queen. 

Take me to your crypt. 

I want to pay my respects. 

We ve been riding 

for a month  my love. 

Surely the dead can wait. 

Ned. 

Where s the imp  

Where is our brother  

Go and find 

the little beast. 

Tell me about 

Jon Arryn. 

One minute 

he was fine and then... 

Burned right through him  

whatever it was. 

I loved that man. 

We both did. 

He never had to teach 

you much  but me  

You remember me at   

All I wanted to do 

was crack skulls 

and fuck girls. 

  He showed me what was what. 

  Aye. 

Don t look at me like that. 

It s not his fault I didn t listen. 

I need you  Ned   

down at King s Landing  not up here 

where you re no damn use to anybody. 

Lord Eddard Stark  

I would name you 

the Hand of the King. 

I m not worthy 

of the honor. 

I m not trying to honor you. 

I m trying to get you to run my kingdom 

while I eat  drink and whore 

my way to an early grave. 

Damn it  Ned  stand up. 

You helped me win 

the iron throne  

now help me 

keep the damn thing. 

We were meant 

to rule together. 

If your sister had lived  

we d have been bound by blood. 

Well  it s not too late. 

I have a son  

you have a daughter. 

We ll join our Houses. 

It is true what they say 

about the northern girls. 

Did you hear the King s 

in Winterfell  

I did hear 

something about that. 

And the Queen 

and her twin brother. 

They say that  i he  i  is the most 

handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms. 

And the other brother  

  The Queen has two brothers  

  There s the pretty one  

and there s 

the clever one. 

Mmm  I hear they 

call him the imp. 

I hear he hates 

that nickname. 

Oh  

I hear he s 

more than earned it. 

I hear he s a drunken 

little lecher  

prone to all manner 

of perversions. 

Clever girl. 

We ve been expecting you  

Lord Tyrion. 

Have you  

  Oh  

  Already  

The gods gave me 

one blessing. 

  Don t get up. 

  My Lord. 

Should I explain to you 

the meaning of a closed door 

  in a whorehouse  brother  

  You have much to teach me  no doubt  

but our sister craves 

your attention. 

She has odd cravings  

our sister. 

A family trait. 

Now the Starks are 

feasting us at sundown. 

Don t leave me alone 

with these people. 

 i I m sorry  I ve begun  i  

 i the feast a bit early.  i  

And this is the first 

of many courses. 

I thought 

you might say that. 

But since 

we re short on time... 

Come on  girls. 

See you at sundown. 

 i Close the door   i  

Did you have to bury her 

in a place like this  

 i She should be  i  

 i on a hill somewhere  i  

with the sun 

and the clouds above her. 

 i She was my sister.  i  

This is where 

she belongs. 

She belonged with me. 

In my dreams  

I kill him every night. 

It s done  your Grace. 

The Targaryens are gone. 

Not all of them. 

 i Daenerys   i  

Daenerys. 

There s our bride to be. 

Look  a gift 

from Illyrio. 

Touch it. 

Go on  

feel the fabric. 

Mmm. 

Isn t he a gracious host  

We ve been his guests 

for over a year 

and he s never 

asked us for anything. 

Illyrio s no fool. 

He knows I won t 

forget my friends 

when I come 

into my throne. 

You still slouch. 

Let them see. 

You have 

a woman s body now. 

I need you to be 

perfect today. 

Can you do that for me  

You don t want to wake 

the dragon  do you  

No. 

When they write the history 

of my reign  sweet sister  

they will say 

it began today. 

It s too hot  my lady. 

Where is he  

The Dothraki are not known 

for their punctuality. 

Athchomar chomakaan  Khal vezhven. 

May I present 

my honored guests  

 i Viserys  i  

 i of House Targaryen   i  

 i the third of his name   i  

 i the rightful king of the Andals  i  

 i and the first men   i  

 i and his sister  i  

 i Daenerys  i  

 i of House Targaryen.  i  

Do you see 

how long his hair is  

 i When Dothraki are  i  

 i defeated in combat   i  

 i they cut off their braids  i  

 i so the whole world can  i  

 i see their shame.  i  

Khal Drogo has 

never been defeated. 

He s a savage  of course  

 i but one of the finest  i  

 i killers alive.  i  

And you will be his Queen. 

Come forward  my dear. 

Where is he going   

  The ceremony is over. 

  But he didn t say anything. 

  Did he like her  

  Trust me  your Grace  

if he didn t like her  

we d know. 

It won t be 

long now. 

Soon you will cross 

the Narrow Sea 

and take back 

your father s throne. 

The people 

drink secret toasts 

to your health. 

They cry out 

for their true king. 

When will they 

be married  

Soon. 

The Dothraki never stay still for long. 

Is it true they lie 

with their horses  

I wouldn t ask 

Khal Drogo. 

Do you take me 

for a fool  

I take you 

for a King. 

Kings lack the caution 

of common men. 

My apologies if 

I ve given offense. 

I know how to play 

a man like Drogo. 

I give him a Queen 

and he gives me an army. 

I don t want 

to be his Queen. 

I want to go home. 

So do I. 

I want us both 

to go home  

but they took it from us. 

So tell me  sweet sister  

how do we go home  

I don t know. 

We go home with an army. 

With Khal Drogo s army. 

I would let 

his whole tribe fuck you   

all   men 

and their horses too 

if that s what it took. 

Do you think Joffrey 

will like me  

What if he thinks 

I m ugly  

Then he is the stupidest prince 

that ever lived. 

He s so handsome. 

When would we be married  

Soon  Or do we have to wait  

Hush now. 

Your father hasn t even said yes. 

Why would he say no  

He d be the second most powerful man 

in the kingdoms. 

He d have to leave home. 

He d have to leave me. 

And so would you. 

You left your home 

to come here. 

And I d be Queen someday. 

Please make father 

say yes  

  Sansa   

  Please please  

It s the only thing 

I ever wanted. 

Fill that up  

Boys  Rodrik  come on. 

 i Come on   i  

Is he dead yet  

Uncle Benjen. 

You got bigger. 

Rode all day. 

Didn t want to leave you 

alone with the Lannisters. 

Why aren t you 

at the feast  

Lady Stark thought 

it might insult the royal family 

to seat a bastard 

in their midst. 

Well  you re always 

welcome on the wall. 

No bastard was ever 

refused a seat there. 

So take me with you 

when you go back. 

  Jon   

  Father will let me if you ask him. 

I know he will. 

The wall isn t 

going anywhere. 

I m ready 

to swear your oath. 

You don t understand 

what you d be giving up. 

We have no families. 

  None of us will ever father sons   

  I don t care about that  

You might  if you knew 

what it meant. 

I d better get inside  

rescue your father 

from his guests. 

We ll talk later. 

 i Your Uncle s in  i  

 i The Night s Watch.  i  

What are you doing 

back there  

Preparing for a night 

with your family. 

I ve always wanted 

to see the wall. 

You re Tyrion Lannister  

the Queen s brother  

My greatest 

accomplishment. 

And you   you re Ned Stark s 

bastard  aren t you  

Did I offend you  

Sorry. 

You are 

the bastard though. 

 i Lord Eddard Stark  i  

 i is my father.  i  

And Lady Stark 

is not your mother  

making you the bastard. 

Let me give you 

some advice  bastard. 

Never forget 

what you are. 

The rest of the world 

will not. 

Wear it like armor 

and it can never 

be used to hurt you. 

What the hell do you know about 

being a bastard  

All dwarves are bastards 

in their father s eyes. 

You at a feast   

it s like a bear in a trap. 

The boy I beheaded   

  did you know him  

  Of course I did. 

Just a lad. 

And he was tough  Ned  

a true ranger. 

Pfft. 

He was talking madness. 

Said the Walkers 

slaughtered his friends. 

The two he was with 

are still missing. 

Hmph. 

A wildling ambush. 

Maybe. 

Direwolves 

south of the wall  

talk of The Walkers  

and my brother might be 

the next Hand of the King. 

Winter  i is  i  coming. 

Winter is coming. 

  Uncle Benjen. 

  Robb boy. 

  How are you  

  I m good. 

Is this your first time 

in the north  your Grace  

Yes. 

Lovely country. 

I m sure it s very grim 

after King s Landing. 

I remember how scared I was 

when Ned brought me 

up here 

for the first time. 

Hello  little dove. 

But you are a beauty. 

  How old are you  

    your Grace. 

You re tall. 

Still growing  

I think so  your Grace. 

And have you bled yet  

No  your Grace. 

Your dress  

did you make it  

Such a talent. 

You must make something for me. 

I hear we might share 

a grandchild someday. 

I hear the same. 

Your daughter will 

do well in the capital. 

Such a beauty shouldn t stay hidden 

up here forever. 

  Your pardon. 

  I hear we might be neighbors soon. 

  I hope it s true. 

  Yes  

the King has honored me 

with his offer. 

I m sure we ll have 

a tournament 

to celebrate your new title   

if you accept. 

It would be good 

to have you on the field. 

The competition 

has become a bit stale. 

  I don t fight in tournaments. 

  No  

Getting 

a little old for it  

I don t fight 

in tournaments 

because when I fight 

a man for real 

I don t want him to know 

what I can do. 

Well said. 

Arya  

It s not funny  

 i She always  i  

 i does this.  i  

 i This was  i  

 i my favorite dress.  i  

She always does it 

and it s not funny  

Time for bed. 

I m a Northman. 

I belong here with you  

not down south 

in that rats  nest 

they call a capital. 

I  i won t  i  let him 

take you. 

The king 

takes what he wants. 

That s why he s King. 

I ll say  

 listen  fat man.  

 You are not taking 

my husband anywhere. 

He belongs to me now.  

How did he get so fat  

He only stops eating 

when it s time for a drink. 

 i It s Maester Luwin   i  

 i my Lord.  i  

Send him in. 

Pardon  my Lord  

my Lady. 

A rider in the night... 

from your sister. 

  Stay. 

  This was sent from the Eyrie. 

What s she doing 

at the Eyrie  

She hasn t been back there 

since her wedding. 

What news  

 i She s fled  i  

 i the capital.  i  

She says Jon Arryn 

was murdered. 

By the Lannisters. 

She says the King 

is in danger. 

She s fresh widowed  Cat. 

She doesn t know 

what she s saying. 

Lysa s head would be 

on a spike right now 

if the wrong people 

had found that letter. 

Do you think she would 

risk her life   

her son s life   

if she wasn t certain 

her husband was murdered  

If this news is true 

and the Lannisters 

conspire against the throne  

who but you can 

protect the King  

They murdered 

the last Hand. 

Now you want Ned 

to take the job  

The King rode 

for a month 

to ask for 

Lord Stark s help. 

He s the only one 

he trusts. 

You swore the King 

an oath  my Lord. 

He s spent half his life 

fighting Robert s wars. 

He owes him nothing. 

Your father and brother 

rode south once 

on a King s demand. 

A different time. 

A different King. 

When do I meet 

with the Khal  

We need to begin 

planning the invasion. 

If Khal Drogo has 

promised you a crown  

  you shall have it. 

  When  

When their omens 

favor war. 

I piss on Dothraki omens. 

I ve waited  years 

to get my throne back. 

A Dothraki wedding 

without at least three deaths 

is considered a dull affair. 

 i Jadi   i  

 i zhey jorah andahli   i

A small gift

songs and histories 

from the Seven Kingdoms. 

Thank you  Ser. 

Are you from my country  

Ser Jorah Mormont 

of Bear Island. 

I served your father 

for many years. 

Gods be good  I hope to always 

serve the rightful King. 

Dragon s eggs  Daenerys  

from the Shadow Lands 

beyond Asshai. 

The ages have 

turned them to stone  

but they will 

always be beautiful. 

Thank you  Magister. 

She s beautiful. 

Ser Jorah  

I don t know how to say 

thank you 

in Dothraki. 

There is no word 

for thank you in Dothraki. 

Make him happy. 

No. 

Do you know 

the common tongue  

No. 

Is  no  the only word 

that you know  

 i No.  i  

Rough night  imp  

If I get through this 

without squirting 

from one end or the other 

it ll be a miracle. 

I didn t pick you 

for a hunter. 

The greatest in the land   

my spear never misses. 

It s not hunting 

if you pay for it. 

Are you as good 

with a spear as you used to be  

No  but I m still 

better than you. 

I know what I m 

putting you through. 

Thank you for saying yes. 

I only ask you 

because I need you. 

You re a loyal friend. 

You hear me  

A  i loyal friend.  i  

The last one I ve got. 

  I hope I ll serve you well. 

  You will. 

And I ll make sure you 

don t look so fucking grim all the time. 

 i Come on  boys   i  

 i let s go kill some boar   i  

Come on  you. 

Stop  

Stop. 

Are you completely mad  

  He saw us. 

  It s all right  it s all right. 

  It s all right. 

  He saw us  

I heard you 

the first time. 

Quite the little climber  

aren t you  

  How old are you  boy  

  . 

. 

The things 

I do for love. 

 i  seagulls calling   i  

 men shouting  

Your Grace  if you d like 

to sit  I m sure that   

We ve been here since midday. 

Easterners have a difference 

sense of time  I ve often found. 

Once I was waiting for Salladhor 

Saan here in Braavos. 

Together  we were going to run 

three shiploads 

of the finest   

 i  doors close   i  

Welcome to the Iron Bank. 

Please  sit. 

What can we do 

for you  Lord Stannis  

This is Stannis 

of the House Baratheon  

 i King of the Andals  i  

 i and the First Men   i  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms 

and Protector of the Realm. 

 i The Iron Throne  i  

 i is currently occupied  i  

by Tommen 

of the House Baratheon  

King of the Andals 

and the First Men  

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms 

and Protector of the Realm. 

He shares no blood with me. 

He is a bastard born of incest. 

 i As was his brother before him.  i  

Yes  we have heard this story. 

It s not a story. 

It s the truth. 

The king s grandfather 

tells a different story. 

A story about a jealous uncle 

whose attempts to usurp the 

throne from the rightful king 

cost the Seven Kingdoms 

dearly in blood and gold. 

Gold you loaned him. 

And you feel your blood gives 

you a claim on our gold  

More than any man living. 

Across the Narrow Sea  

your books are filled 

with words like 

  usurper   and   madman   

and   blood right.   

Here  our books 

are filled with numbers. 

We prefer the stories they tell. 

More plain. 

Less open to interpretation. 

How many fighting men 

remain loyal to you  

 . 

 i And how many ships do you have   i  

 i The ones still afloat   i  

 i Ser Davos   i  

not at the bottom 

of Blackwater Bay. 

. 

And how much wheat 

and barley and beef 

and pork do you produce 

on Dragonstone 

to feed your   men 

on your  ships  

None. 

You can see why these numbers 

seem unlikely to add up 

to a happy ending 

from our perspective. 

 i I m afraid we must respectfully  i  

 i decline your request.  i  

 i But we thank you for paying  i  

 i us the honor of your visit.  i  

My lord. 

I m not a lord  

Ser Davos Seaworth. 

You would not be either here. 

In Braavos  

thieves are not 

rewarded with titles. 

Well  strictly speaking  

I didn t do the thieving. 

That would be the pirates. 

I just moved what they stole 

from one place to another. 

This is the payment 

that was demanded 

by King Stannis for my crimes. 

I consider it 

an honest accounting. 

He s an honest man 

and he s your best chance 

to get back the money 

you ve sunk into Westeros. 

Which is a lot  I imagine. 

Wars are expensive. 

The war is over. 

As long as Stannis lives  

the war is not over. 

Who s the real power 

in King s Landing  

    Ser Davos... 

    Humor me. 

     i  Tywin Lannister.  i  

    How old is Tywin Lannister  

    . 

    . And when he dies  who s in command  

A half grown boy  

 i the product of incest   i  

Cersei Lannister  a queen 

whose people despise her  

Jaime Lannister  a man best 

known for killing the king 

 i he was sworn to protect   i  

When Tywin s gone  

who do you back  

That is a problem 

for another time. 

Begging your pardon  

I think it s a problem for now. 

There s only one reliable 

leader left in Westeros. 

Stannis. 

He s got the birthright. 

He s in his prime. 

He s a tried and tested 

battle commander. 

And he doesn t just talk 

about paying people back  

he does it. 

Saan  i  The lookout sees a 

pirate ship sailing their way.  i  

 i The captain shouts  i  

 i to his first mate   i  

  Bring me 

my red shirt.   

The first mate brings the red 

shirt and the captain puts it on. 

And when the pirates 

try to board  

the brave captain leads 

his men to victory. 

A few days later  

the lookout screams  

  Two pirate ships    

The crew is shivering 

like scared mice. 

But the courageous 

captain hollers  

  Bring me 

my red shirt    

 i After the battle   i  

 i the first mate asks   i  

  Captain  why do you call for 

your red shirt before battle    

The captain replies  

  So that if I am stabbed  

you will not see me bleed.   

The next morning 

the lookout screams  

   pirate ships  

    We are surrounded    

     women laugh  

 i The crew goes silent.  i  

 i They all look  i  

 i to their brave captain   i  

 i waiting for his usual command.  i  

 i Calm as ever   i  

 i the captain bellows...  i  

Women        Bring me my brown pants    

 laughs  

You think they ever met a pirate 

who didn t tell them that joke

     chuckles  

I heard you were rotting in 

a dungeon in Dragonstone. 

Only half rotted.

Join us.

You won t be alone. 

And you won t be poor.

stuff left back at your house. 

I gave it to your wife.

Queen Daenerys. 

Tales of your beauty 

were not exaggerated. 

I thank you. 

Mine is one of the oldest and 

proudest families in Meereen. 

Then it is my honor 

to receive you. 

My father  one of 

Meereen s most respected 

and beloved citizens  

oversaw the restoration 

and maintenance 

of its greatest landmarks. 

This pyramid included. 

For that  he has my gratitude. 

I should be honored to meet him. 

You have  Your Grace. 

You crucified him. 

I pray you ll never live to see 

a member of your family 

treated so cruelly. 

Your father crucified 

innocent children. 

My father spoke out against 

crucifying those children. 

He decried it as a criminal 

act  but was overruled. 

Is it justice to answer 

one crime with another  

I am sorry you no longer 

have a father  

but my treatment 

of the masters was no crime. 

You d be wise to remember that. 

What s done is done. 

You are the queen and I 

am a servant of Meereen. 

A servant who does not wish to 

see its traditions eradicated. 

And what traditions 

do you speak of  

 i The tradition of funeral rite.  i  

Proper burial in 

the Temple of the Graces. 

My father and  

noble Meereenese 

are still nailed to those posts  

carrion for vultures  

rotting in the sun. 

Your Grace  I ask that you 

order these men taken down 

so that they might receive 

proper burials. 

And what of the slave children 

these noble Meereenese crucified  

They were rotting 

in the sun as well. 

 i Would you have begged me for 

their right to a proper burial   i  

Your Grace  I cannot defend 

the actions of the masters. 

I can only speak to you as a 

son who loved his father. 

 i Let me take his body down.  i  

 i Let me have him brought  i  

 i to the temple  i  

and buried with dignity 

so that he might find 

peace in the next world. 

Bury your father  

Hizdahr zo Loraq. 

Thank you  my queen. 

How many more  

There are  supplicants 

waiting  Your Grace. 

Send the next one in. 

These meetings aren t always going 

to be this early  are they  

I was up late last night. 

So  does this mean I am a 

master of something now  

Coins  ships  

Lord Tywin and I 

already determined 

that I shall be the Master 

of Ships long before you   

Lord Tywin  it s a great honor 

to have been granted a 

seat on this council. I   

Tywin   i The trial 

begins this afternoon.  i  

We only have the morning 

for affairs of state. 

Shall we begin  

Varys  Sandor Clegane 

has been spotted 

in the Riverlands  my lord. 

A coward and a traitor. 

My birds tell me the Hound 

slaughtered five of our soldiers. 

I believe the phrase 

  fuck the king   was uttered. 

Disgraceful. 

Tywin   i What would it take 

to make the common soldier  i  

stupid enough to try 

his luck with the Hound  

 silver stags 

seems a generous bounty. 

Make it . 

What else  

More whispers 

from the east  my lord. 

The Targaryen girl  

Daenerys has taken up 

residence in Meereen. 

She has conquered the city 

and rules as its queen. 

Conquered with what  

Varys   i She commands an army 

of Unsullied  my queen.  i  

Some   strong. 

She has a company 

of sellswords   

the Second Sons. 

 i She has two knights  i  

 i advising her    i  

Jorah Mormont 

and Barristan Selmy. 

And she has three dragons. 

Baby dragons. 

Larger every year  Your Grace. 

Mormont is spying on her for us. 

No longer. He appears 

to be fully devoted to her. 

As for Ser Barristan  

it would seem 

he took his dismissal 

from the Kingsguard 

a bit harder than anticipated. 

He s an old man. 

He wasn t fit to protect my son. 

Joffrey didn t die on his watch. 

Dismissing him was as 

insulting as it was stupid. 

Don t tell me you re worried about 

a child halfway across the world. 

A child with two seasoned 

warriors counseling her 

and a powerful army 

at her back  Your Grace. 

Lord Varys is right. 

I have been to Essos and seen 

the Unsullied firsthand. 

They are very impressive 

on the battlefield. 

Less so in the bedroom. 

Dragons haven t won 

a war in  years. 

Armies win them all the time. 

She must be dealt with. 

How  my lord  

By force  

Eventually  if it comes to that. 

Can your little birds 

find their way into Meereen  

Most certainly  my Lord Hand. 

Mmm. Lord Tyrell  

be a good man. 

 i Fetch my quill and paper.  i  

 i  footsteps   i  

Prince Oberyn. 

Lord Varys... 

Only Varys. 

I m not actually a nobleman. 

No one is under obligation 

to call me lord. 

And yet everyone does. 

You seem quite knowledgeable 

about the Unsullied. 

Did you spend much time 

in Essos  

Five years. 

May I ask why  

 Tis a big and beautiful world. 

Most of us live and die 

in the same corner 

where we were born 

and never get to see any of it. 

I don t want to be most of us. 

Most of us aren t princes. 

 chuckles  

You are from Essos. 

Where  Lys  

 i I have an ear for accents.  i  

I ve lost my accent entirely. 

I have an ear for that as well. 

 i How did you get here   i  

It s a long story. 

One you don t like 

telling people. 

People I trust. 

My paramour Ellaria  she would 

find you very interesting. 

You should come to 

the brothel and meet her. 

We brought our own wine  not 

the swill they serve here. 

We have some lovely 

boys on retainer  but... 

You did like boys before  

Really  

Girls  Hmm. 

I hope you won t be offended when 

I say I never would have guessed. 

Not at all. 

But I was never interested 

in girls  either. 

    What then  

     i  Nothing.  i  

Everybody is interested 

in something. 

 i Not me.  i  

When I see what 

desire does to people  

what it s done to this country  

I am very glad 

to have no part in it. 

 i Besides  the absence of desire  i  

leaves one free to pursue 

other things. 

Such as  

 i  keys clinking   i  

Let me guess  

I ve been pardoned. 

Really

Well  we mustn t 

disappoint Father.

And with him Prince Oberyn 

of the House Martell

 i of the House Tyrell.  i  

And if found guilty... 

may the gods punish the accused. 

Tyrion of the House Lannister  

you stand accused by

Did you kill King Joffrey  

No. 

Did your wife  the Lady Sansa  

Not that I know of. 

How would you say he died  then  

Choked on his pigeon pie. 

So you would blame the bakers  

Or the pigeons. 

Just leave me out of it. 

 i  crowd murmuring   i  

The crown may call 

its first witness. 

Once we d got 

King Joffrey safely away 

from the mob  

the Imp rounded on him. 

He slapped the king 

across the face 

and called him a vicious 

idiot and a fool. 

 crowd gasps  

 i It wasn t the first time  i  

 i the Imp threatened Joffrey.  i  

Right here in this throne room  

he marched up those steps 

and called our king a halfwit. 

 i Compared His Grace  i  

 i to the Mad King  i  

 i and suggested he d meet  i  

 i the same fate.  i  

And when I spoke 

in the king s defense  

he threatened to have me killed. 

Oh  why don t you tell 

them what Joffrey was doing

Tywin       i Grand Maester   i  

you examined 

King Joffrey s corpse. 

Was it without question 

poison that killed him  

Without question. 

 i  crowd murmuring   i  

This was found on the body 

of Dontos Hollard  

the king s fool. 

He was last seen 

spiriting Sansa Stark  

the wife of the accused  

away from the feast. 

She wore this necklace 

 i the day of the wedding.  i  

 i Residue of a most rare  i  

and terrible poison 

was found inside. 

Was this one of the poisons 

stolen from your store  

It was. 

The Strangler. 

A poison few in 

the Seven Kingdoms possess. 

And used to strike down 

the most noble child 

the gods ever put 

on this good earth. 

 crowd murmuring  

Cersei       i   I will hurt you for this.  i  

 i A day will come when you  i  

 i think you are safe and happy  i  

and your joy will turn 

to ashes in your mouth 

and you will know 

the debt is paid.   

Your own brother 

said this to you  

Shortly before the Battle 

of Blackwater Bay. 

I confronted him about his plans 

to put Joffrey on the front lines. 

As it turned out  

when the attack came  

Joff insisted on remaining 

at the battlements. 

He believed his presence 

would inspire the troops. 

Tyrion said  

  And you will know 

the debt is paid.   

What debt  

I discovered 

he d been keeping whores 

in the Tower of the Hand. 

I asked him to confine 

his salacious acts 

 i to the brothel  i  

 i where such behavior belongs.  i  

He wasn t pleased. 

Thank you  Your Grace  

for the courage 

of your testimony. 

Mace  i  Do you remember the 

precise nature of this threat   i  

Varys       i I m afraid I do  my lord.  i  

 i He said    Perhaps you should 

speak more softly to me  then.  i  

Monsters are dangerous 

and just now kings 

are dying like flies.   

And he said this to you at a 

meeting of the small council  

Yes. 

After we received word 

of Robb Stark s death. 

He didn t seem gladdened 

by the news. 

Perhaps his marriage 

to Sansa Stark 

had made him more sympathetic 

to the northern cause. 

 crowd murmuring  

You re excused  Lord Varys. 

Father  may I ask 

the witness one question  

One. 

You once said 

that without me  this city would 

have faced certain defeat. 

You said the histories 

would never mention me  

but you would not forget. 

Have you forgotten  Lord Varys  

Sadly  my lord  

I never forget a thing. 

We will adjourn for now. 

Toll the bells 

in an hour s time. 

Guard       i Clear the court   i  

 crowd chatting  

Jaime   i You d condemn 

your own son to death   i  

I ve condemned no one. 

The trial is not over. 

This isn t a trial. 

It s a farce. 

Cersei has manipulated 

everything and you know it. 

I know nothing of the sort. 

    You ve always hated Tyrion. 

    He killed his king. 

As did I. 

Do you know the last order 

the Mad King gave me  

 i To bring him your head.  i  

I saved your life so you 

could murder my brother  

    It won t be murder. It ll be justice. 

    Justice  

I m performing my sworn 

duty as Hand of the King. 

If Tyrion is found guilty  he 

will be punished accordingly. 

    He ll be executed. 

    No  he ll be punished accordingly. 

Once you said family 

is what lives on. 

All that lives on. 

You told me about a dynasty 

that would last   years. 

What happens to your dynasty 

when Tyrion dies  

I m a Kingsguard  

forbidden by oath 

to carry on the family line. 

I m well aware of your oath. 

What happens to your name  

Who carries the lion banner 

into future battles  

Your nephews  

Lancel Lannister  

Others whose names 

I don t even remember  

What happens to my dynasty 

if I spare the life 

of my grandson s killer  

It survives through me. 

I ll leave the Kingsguard. 

I ll take my place 

as your son and heir 

if you let Tyrion live. 

Done. 

When the testimony s concluded 

and a guilty verdict rendered  

Tyrion will be given 

the chance to speak. 

He ll plead for mercy. I ll allow 

him to join the Night s Watch. 

 i In three days  time  he ll 

depart for Castle Black  i  

 i and live out his days  i  

 i at the Wall.  i  

 i You ll remove your  i  

 i white cloak immediately.  i  

 i You will leave King s Landing  i  

 i to assume your rightful  i  

 i place at Casterly Rock.  i  

You will marry a suitable woman 

and father children 

named Lannister. 

And you ll never turn your 

back on your family again. 

You have my word. 

And you have mine. 

 i  bell tolling   i  

Not going well  is it  

    You re going to be found guilty. 

    Oh  you think so  

When you are  you need to 

enter a formal plea for mercy 

and ask to be sent to the Wall. 

Father s agreed to it. 

He ll spare your life and allow 

you to join the Night s Watch. 

Ned Stark was promised 

the same thing 

 i and we both know  i  

 i how that turned out.  i  

Jaime   i Father is not Joffrey. 

He ll keep his word.  i  

How do you know  

Do you trust me  

Keep your mouth shut. 

No more outbursts. 

This will all be over soon. 

The crown may call 

its next witness. 

 i  footsteps   i  

State your name. 

Shae. 

Do you swear by all the gods 

that your testimony 

will be true and honest  

I swear it. 

Do you know this man  

Yes. 

Tyrion Lannister. 

How do you know him  

I was handmaiden 

to his wife Lady Sansa. 

This man stands accused 

of murdering King Joffrey. 

What do you know of this  

I know that he s guilty. 

 crowd gasps  

He and Sansa 

planned it together. 

 crowd murmuring  

Tywin       i Silence   i  

 i Continue.  i  

Shae   i She wanted revenge 

for her father   i  

 i her mother  her brother.  i  

 i She blamed their deaths  i  

 i on the king.  i  

 i Tyrion was happy to help.  i  

He hated Joffrey. 

He hated the queen. 

He hated you  my lord. 

He stole poison from 

the Grand Maester s chamber 

to put in Joffrey s wine. 

Oberyn   i How could you 

possibly know all this   i  

Why would he reveal 

such plans to his wife s maid  

I wasn t just her maid. 

I was his whore. 

     crowd murmuring  

    Mace  i  I beg your pardon   i  

You said you were his... 

His whore. 

How did you come 

to be in his service  

He stole me. 

I was with another man  

a knight in 

your lordship s army. 

But when Tyrion arrived 

at the camp  

he sent one of his cutthroats 

into our tent. 

 i He broke the knight s arm  i  

 i and brought me to Lord Tyrion.  i  

  You belong to me now    he said. 

  I want you to fuck me like it s 

my last night in this world.   

 crowd laughs  

Silence. 

Silence  

 i  laughing stops   i  

Oberyn      And did you  

Did I what  

Fuck him like it was 

his last night in this world. 

 i  crowd laughs   i  

I did everything he wanted. 

Whatever he told me 

to do to him. 

Whatever he felt like doing to me. 

 i I kissed him where he wanted.  i  

 i I licked him where he wanted.  i  

 i I let him put himself  i  

 i where he wanted.  i  

I was his property. 

I would wait in his chambers 

for hours 

so he could use me 

when he was bored. 

He ordered me to call 

him   my lion    so I did. 

I took his face 

in my hands and said  

  I am yours 

and you are mine.   

 crowd murmuring  

Shae. 

Please don t. 

I am a whore. 

 i Remember   i  

That was before 

he married Sansa. 

After that  

all he wanted was her. 

But she wouldn t let him 

into her bed. 

So he promised to kill 

King Joffrey for her. 

 i  crowd clamoring   i  

I wish to confess. 

I wish... 

to confess. 

 i  crowd quiets   i  

You wish to confess  

I saved you. 

I saved this city 

and all your worthless lives. 

I should have let 

Stannis kill you all. 

     clamoring  

    Tywin  Tyrion. 

Tywin      Do you wish to confess  

Yes  Father. 

I m guilty. 

Guilty. Is that what 

you want to hear  

You admit you poisoned the king  

No  of that I m innocent. 

I m guilty of a far 

more monstrous crime. 

I am guilty of being a dwarf. 

You are not on trial 

for being a dwarf. 

Tyrion       i Oh  yes  I am.  i  

I ve been on trial 

for that my entire life. 

Have you nothing to say 

in your defense  

Tyrion       i Nothing but this    i  

I did not do it. 

I did not kill Joffrey  

but I wish that I had. 

 i Watching your vicious  i  

 i bastard die  i  

gave me more relief 

than   lying whores. 

 i  crowd clamoring   i  

I wish I was the monster 

you think I am. 

I wish I had enough poison 

for the whole pack of you. 

I would gladly give my life 

to watch you all swallow it. 

    Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. 

     crowd shouting  

Escort the prisoner 

back to his cell. 

I will not give my life 

for Joffrey s murder. 

 i And I know I ll get  i  

 i no justice here.  i  

So I will let 

the gods decide my fate. 

I demand a trial by combat. 

 i  crowd shouting   i  

Still not far 

 i from Pentos  Your Grace.  i  

You d be more 

comfortable there. 

I have no interest 

in hospitality or comfort. 

I ll stay with Drogo 

until he fulfills 

his end of the bargain 

and I have my crown. 

I have something for you. 

First lesson  Stick them 

with the pointy end. 

 years ago you rode off 

with Robert Baratheon. 

   i And now you re leaving again.  i  

   i I have no choice.  i  

There s great honor serving 

in the Night s Watch. 

The Starks have manned the 

Wall for thousands of years. 

 i And you are a Stark.  i  

Daenerys Targaryen has wed 

some Dothraki horselord. 

What of it  

Tell me we re not speaking of this. 

I ll kill every Targaryen 

I get my hands on. 

Rapers. Not impressed 

by your new brothers  

 i Lovely thing about the watch    i  

 i You discard your old family  i  

 i and get a whole new one.  i  

Welcome. 

I don t think Bran 

fell from that tower. 

I think he was thrown. 

No  

 i Someone tried  i  

 i to kill him twice.  i  

 i I would stake my life  i  

 i the Lannisters are involved.  i  

  Lord Stark must be told of this. 

   i I will go myself.  i  

What is the meaning of this  

 i Joff told us what happened.  i  

 i You and that boy beat him with clubs while  i  

 i you set your wolf on him.  i  

 i That s not what happened   i  

Ahh  

We found no trace of the 

direwolf  Your Grace. 

  We have another wolf. 

  As you will. 

He doesn t mean Lady  does he  

 i Lady didn t bite anyone   i  

 i She s good   i  

Welcome  Lord Stark. 

Grand Maester Pycelle has called 

a meeting of the small council. 

The honor of your 

presence is requested. 

Get the girls settled in. 

I ll be back in time for supper. 

  And  Jory  you go with them. 

  Yes  My Lord. 

If you d like to change into 

something more appropriate... 

Thank the gods 

you re here  Stark. 

About time we had some stern 

northern leadership. 

About glad to see you re 

protecting the throne. 

Sturdy old thing. 

How many kings  asses 

have polished it  I wonder  

Um  what s the line  

The King shits 

and the Hand wipes. 

Very handsome armor. 

  Not a scratch on it. 

  I know. 

People have been swinging at me for 

years  but they always seem to miss. 

You ve chosen your 

opponents wisely then. 

I have a knack for it. 

It must be strange for you 

coming into this room. 

I was standing right here 

when it happened. 

He was very brave  

your brother. 

Your father too. 

They didn t deserve 

to die like that. 

Nobody deserves 

to die like that. 

But you just stood there 

and watched. 

 men just stood there 

and watched. 

All the great knights 

of the Seven Kingdoms   

You think anyone said a 

word  lifted a finger  

No  Lord Stark. 

 men and this room 

was silent as a crypt. 

Except for the screams  

of course  

and the Mad King laughing. 

And later... 

When I watched 

the Mad King die  

I remembered him laughing 

as your father burned... 

It felt like justice. 

Is that what you 

tell yourself at night  

You re a servant of justice  

That you were avenging 

my father when you 

shoved your sword in 

Aerys Targaryen s back  

Tell me   

If I d stabbed the Mad King in 

the belly instead of the back  

would you admire me more  

You served him well 

when serving was safe. 

Lord Stark. 

Lord Varys. 

I was grievously sorry to hear of 

your troubles on the Kingsroad. 

We are all praying for prince 

Joffrey s full recovery. 

A shame you didn t say a 

prayer for the butcher s son. 

Renly  

You re looking well. 

And you look 

tired from the road. 

I told them this meeting 

could wait another day  but   

 i But we have a kingdom  i  

 i to look after.  i  

I ve hoped to meet you 

for some time  Lord Stark. 

  No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me. 

  She has  Lord Baelish. 

I understand you knew 

my brother Brandon as well. 

All too well. 

I still carry a token of his esteem 

from navel to collarbone. 

Perhaps you chose 

the wrong man to duel with. 

It wasn t the  i man  i  

that I chose  My Lord. 

It was Catelyn Tully. 

A woman worth fighting for  

I m sure you ll agree. 

I humbly beg your pardon  

my Lord Stark. 

Grand Maester. 

How many years has it been  

   i You were a young man.  i  

  And you served another King. 

Oh  how forgetful of me. 

This belongs to you  now. 

 i Should we begin   i  

  Without the King  

  Winter may be coming  

but I m afraid the same cannot 

be said for my brother. 

His Grace has many cares. 

He entrusts some 

small matters to us 

that we might lighten the load. 

We are the lords 

of small matters here. 

 i My brother instructs us  i  

 i to stage a tournament  i  

in honor of Lord Stark s 

appointment as Hand of the King. 

  Mmm  how much  

    gold dragons to the champion  

 i   to the runner up   i  

  to the winning archer. 

Can the treasury bear 

such expense  

I ll have to borrow it. 

The Lannisters will accommodate  I expect. 

We already owe Lord Tywin  million gold. 

What s another    

Are you telling me the Crown 

is three million in debt  

I m telling you the Crown 

is  i six  i  million in debt. 

How could you let this happen  

The Master of Coin 

finds the money. 

The King and the Hand spend it. 

I will not believe Jon Arryn 

allowed Robert 

to bankrupt the realm. 

Lord Arryn gave wise 

and prudent advice  

but I fear His Grace 

  doesn t always listen. 

   Counting coppers   he calls it. 

I ll speak to him tomorrow. 

This tournament is an 

extravagance we cannot afford. 

As you will. 

But still  we d best make our plans. 

There will be no plans 

until I speak to Robert. 

Forgive me  my Lords. 

I m   

   i I had a long ride.  i  

  You are the King s Hand  

Lord Stark  we serve 

at your pleasure. 

  Ow  

  Please  it s nearly healed. 

  It s ugly. 

  A King should have scars 

you fought off a direwolf. 

You re a warrior like your father. 

I m not like him. 

I didn t fight off anything. 

It bit me and all 

I did was scream. 

And the two Stark girls 

saw it  both of them. 

That s not true. 

You killed the beast. 

You only spared the girl because of the 

love your father bears her father. 

I didn t  I   

When Aerys Targaryen 

sat on the Iron Throne  

your father was a rebel 

and a traitor. 

Someday you ll sit on the throne and 

the truth will be what you make it. 

Do I have to marry her  

Yes. 

She s very beautiful and young. 

If you don t like her  you only 

need to see her on formal occasions 

and when the time comes  to make 

little princes and princesses. 

And if you d rather fuck painted 

whores  you ll fuck painted whores. 

And if you d rather lie with 

noble virgins  so be it. 

You are my darling boy 

and the world will be 

exactly as you want it to be. 

Do something nice 

for the Stark girl. 

  I don t want to. 

  No  but you will. 

The occasional kindness will spare you 

all sorts of trouble down the road. 

We allow the northerners 

too much power. 

They consider themselves 

our equals. 

How would you handle them  

I d double their taxes 

and command them to supply 

  men to the royal army. 

  A royal army  

  Why should every lord command his own men  

It s primitive  no better 

than the hill tribes. 

We should have a standing army 

of men loyal to the Crown  

trained by 

experienced soldiers   

Instead of a mob of peasants who ve 

never held pikes in their lives. 

And if the northerners rebel  

I d crush them. 

Seize Winterfell and install 

someone loyal to the realm 

as Warden of the North. 

Uncle Kevan  maybe. 

And these   northern troops  would 

they fight for you or their lord  

  For me. I m their King. 

   i Mm hmm.  i  

But you ve just 

invaded their homeland  

  asked them to kill their brothers. 

  I m not asking. 

The North cannot be held   

not by an outsider. 

It s too big and too wild. 

And when the winter comes  

the seven gods together couldn t 

save you and your royal army. 

A good King knows 

when to save his strength... 

And when to destroy 

his enemies. 

So you agree... 

The Starks are enemies  

Everyone who isn t us 

is an enemy. 

Enough of that  young lady. 

Eat your food. 

  I m practicing. 

  Practicing for what  

  The prince. 

   i Arya  stop   i  

He s a liar and a coward 

and he killed my friend. 

The Hound killed your friend. 

The Hound does whatever 

the prince tells him to do. 

  You re an idiot. 

  You re a liar  and if you told the truth 

  Mycah would be alive. 

  Enough  

What s happening here  

Arya would rather act 

like a beast than a lady. 

Go to your room. 

We ll speak later. 

That s for you  love. 

 i The same dollmaker makes all  i  

 i of Princess Myrcella s toys.  i  

Don t you like it  

I haven t played with dolls 

since I was eight. 

  May I be excused  

  You ve barely eaten a thing. 

It s all right. 

Go on. 

War was easier than daughters. 

Go away  

 i Arya  open the door.  i  

May I come in  

  Whose sword is that  

  Mine. 

Give it to me. 

I know this maker s mark. 

This is Mikken s work. 

Where did you get this  

This is no toy. 

  Little ladies shouldn t play with swords. 

  I wasn t playing. 

And I don t want to be a lady. 

Come here. 

Now what do you want with this  

It s called Needle. 

Oh  a blade with a name. 

And who were you hoping 

to skewer with Needle  

Your sister  

Do you know the first thing 

about sword fighting  

Stick  em with the pointy end. 

That s the essence of it. 

I was trying to learn. 

I asked Mycah 

to practice with me. 

I asked him. 

  It was my fault. 

  No  sweet girl. 

No no  you didn t kill 

the butcher s boy. 

I hate them  

I hate all of them. 

The Hound  the Queen 

and the King 

and Joffrey and Sansa. 

Sansa was dragged before 

the King and Queen... 

And asked to call 

the prince a liar. 

So was I  

He  i is  i  a liar. 

Shh  darling  listen to me. 

Sansa will be married 

to Joffrey s someday. 

She cannot betray him. 

She must take his side 

even when he s wrong. 

But how you can let her 

marry someone like that  

Well. 

Look at me. 

You re a Stark of Winterfell. 

You know our words. 

Winter is coming. 

You were born 

in the long summer. 

You ve never known 

anything else. 

But now winter is truly coming. 

And in the winter  

we must protect ourselves  

look after one another. 

Sansa is your sister. 

I don t hate her. 

Not really. 

I don t want to frighten you  

but I won t lie to you either. 

We ve come 

to a dangerous place. 

We cannot fight a war 

amongst ourselves. 

All right  

Go on. 

It s yours. 

I can keep it  

Try not to stab 

your sister with it. 

If you re going to own a sword  

you d better 

know how to use it. 

Don t listen to it. 

Crows are all liars. 

  I know a story about a crow. 

  I hate your stories. 

I know a story about a boy 

who hated stories. 

I could tell you about 

Ser Duncan the Tall. 

Those were always 

your favorites. 

Those weren t my favorites. 

My favorites were 

the scary ones. 

Oh  my sweet summer child. 

What do you know about fear  

Fear is for the winter  

when the snows fall 

a hundred feet deep. 

Fear is for the long night  

when the sun hides for years 

and children are born 

and live and die 

all in darkness. 

That is the time for fear  

my little Lord  

when the white walkers 

move through the woods. 

Thousands of years ago 

there came a night 

that lasted a generation. 

Kings froze to death 

in their castles  

same as the shepherds 

in their huts. 

And women smothered 

their babies 

 i rather than see them starve   i  

and wept and felt the tears 

freeze on their cheeks. 

So is this the sort 

of story that you like  

In that darkness  

the White Walkers 

came for the first time. 

 i They swept through cities  i  

 i and kingdoms   i  

 i riding their dead horses   i  

hunting with their packs of 

pale spiders big as hounds   

What are you telling him now  

Only what what are the little 

lord wants to hear. 

Get your supper. 

I want some time with him. 

One time she told me 

the sky is blue because 

we live inside the eye 

of a blue eyed giant 

named Macomber. 

Maybe we do. 

How do you feel  

You still don t 

remember anything  

Bran  

I ve seen you climb 

a thousand times. 

In the wind  in the rain   

A thousand times. 

  You never fall. 

  I did though. 

It s true  isn t it  

what Maester Luwin 

says about my legs  

I d rather be dead. 

  Don t ever say that. 

  I d rather be dead. 

Fewer eyes back here  My Lady. 

But still too many. 

It s nine years since I ve 

set foot in the capital. 

And no one knew who I was the 

last time I came either. 

My Lady. 

Welcome to King s Landing  Lady Stark. 

Would you mind following us  

I would. 

We ve done nothing wrong. 

We ve been instructed to 

escort you into the city. 

Instructed  

I don t know who s providing 

your instructions  but   

Follow me  Lady Stark. 

Cat  

Go on. 

Go upstairs. 

You little worm  

You take me for some 

back alley Sally 

you can drag into a   

Pssst  

I meant no disrespect 

to you of all people. 

How dare you bring me here  

Have you lost your mind  

No one will come looking for you here. 

Isn t that what you wanted  

I m truly sorry 

about the locale. 

How did you know I was 

coming to King s Landing  

A dear friend told me. 

  Lady Stark. 

  Lord Varys. 

To see you again after so 

many years is a blessing. 

Your poor hands. 

How did you know I was coming  

Knowledge is my trade  My Lady. 

Did you bring the dagger 

with you  by any chance  

My little birds 

are everywhere... 

Even in the north. 

They whisper to me 

the strangest stories. 

Valyrian steel. 

Do you know whose dagger 

this is  

I must admit I do not. 

Well well  this is an historic day. 

Something you don t know 

 i that I do.  i  

There s only one dagger like this 

in all of the Seven Kingdoms. 

  It s mine. 

  Yours  

At least it was  until the tournament 

on Prince Joffrey s last nameday. 

I bet on Ser Jaime 

in the jousting  

as any sane man would. 

When the Knight of the 

Glowers unseated him  

I lost this dagger. 

To whom  

Tyrion Lannister. 

The Imp. 

 i Grenn  show him what  i  

 i you farm boys are made of.  i  

If that were a real sword  you d be dead. 

Lord Snow here 

grew up in a castle 

spitting down 

on the likes of you. 

Pyp. 

Do you think 

Ned Stark s bastard 

bleeds like the rest of us  

Next  

 i Next   i  

Well  Lord Snow  

 i it appears you re  i  

 i the least useless person here.  i  

Go clean yourselves up. 

 i There s only so much  i  

 i I can stomach in a day.  i  

A charming man. 

 i I don t need him  i  

 i to be charming.  i  

I need him to turn this bunch 

of thieves and runaways 

into men of the Night s Watch. 

And how s that going  

Commander Mormont  

Slowly. 

A raven came 

for Ned Stark s son. 

Good news or bad  

Both. 

 i Lord Stark.  i  

I meant to give you this earlier. 

So forgetful these days. 

A raven from Winterfell 

this morning. 

Good news  

Perhaps you d like to 

share it with your wife  

  My wife is in Winterfell. 

  Is she  

 i Yes  I m looking at you.  i  

I thought that she d 

be safest in here. 

One of several such 

establishments I own. 

You re a funny man. 

Huh  

A very funny man. 

Ned  

Ah  the Starks   

Quick tempers  slow minds. 

You broke my nose  bastard  

It s an improvement. 

If we threw you over the Wall  I wonder 

how long it would take you to hit. 

I wonder if they d find you 

before the wolves did. 

What re you looking at  

Half Man  

I m looking at you. 

 i Yes.  i  

 i You ve got an interesting face.  i  

Hmm  very distinctive faces. 

All of you. 

And what do you care 

about our faces  

It s just I think 

they would look marvelous 

decorating spikes 

in King s Landing. 

Perhaps I ll write my sister  

the Queen  about it. 

We ll talk later  Lord Snow. 

Everybody knew 

what this place was 

and no one told me. 

No one but you. 

My father knew 

and he left me to rot 

at the Wall all the same. 

Grenn s father left him too... 

Outside a farmhouse 

when he was three. 

 i Pyp was caught stealing  i  

 i a wheel of cheese.  i  

His little sister hadn t 

eaten in three days. 

He was given a choice  

his right hand or the Wall. 

I ve been asking the Lord 

commander about them. 

Fascinating stories. 

They hate me because 

I m better than they are. 

It s a lucky thing 

none of them were trained 

by a master at arms 

like your Ser Rodrik. 

I don t imagine any of them 

have ever held a real sword 

before they came here. 

Oh... 

Your brother Bran. 

He s woken up. 

The mere suggestion 

that the Queen s brother 

tried to kill your boy 

would be considered treason. 

We have proof. 

We have the blade. 

Which Lord Tyrion will say 

was stolen from him. 

The only man who could say 

otherwise has no throat  

thanks to your boy s wolf. 

Petyr has promised 

to help us find the truth. 

He s like a little brother 

to me  Ned. 

He would never betray my trust. 

I ll try to keep you 

alive  for her sake. 

A fool s task  admittedly  

 i but I ve never been able  i  

 i to refuse your wife anything.  i  

I won t forget this. 

You re a true friend. 

Don t tell anyone. 

I have a reputation to maintain. 

  How could you be so stupid  

  Calm down. 

He s a child   

 years old. 

  What were you thinking  

  I was thinking of us. 

You re a bit late to start 

complaining about it now. 

  What has the boy told them  

  Nothing. 

He s said nothing. 

He remembers nothing. 

Then what are you raving about  

What if it comes back to him  

If he tells his father 

what he saw   

We ll say he was lying. 

We ll say he was dreaming. 

We ll say whatever we like. 

I think we can outfox 

a  year old. 

  And my husband  

  I ll go to war with him if I have to. 

They can write 

a ballad about us  

 The War for Cersei s Cunt.  

  Let me go. 

  Never. 

  Let me go. 

  The boy 

won t talk. 

And if he does  I ll kill him. 

Him  Ned Stark  the King   

the whole bloody lot of them  

until you and I are 

the only people 

left in this world. 

I wish I could see the girls. 

  It s too dangerous. 

  Just for a moment. 

Until we know 

who our enemies are   

I know they did it  Ned. 

The Lannisters. 

In my bones  I know it. 

Littlefinger s right. 

I can t do anything 

without proof. 

And if you find the proof  

Then I bring it to Robert... 

And hope he s still 

the man I once knew. 

You watch yourself 

on the road  huh  

That temper of yours 

is a dangerous thing. 

My temper  

Gods be good  

you nearly killed poor 

Littlefinger yesterday. 

He still loves you. 

Does he  

Off with you. 

Yes  it s been a long time. 

But I still remember 

every face. 

You remember your first  

Of course  Your Grace. 

Who was it  

A Tyroshi. 

  Never learned the name. 

  Hmm. 

How d you do it  

Lance through the heart. 

 i Quick one.  i  

Lucky for you. 

Mine was some Tarly boy 

at the Battle of Summerhall. 

 i My horse took an arrow  i  

 i so I was on foot   i  

 i slogging through the mud.  i  

He came running at me  

this dumb high born lad  

thinking he could end 

the rebellion 

 i with single swing of his sword.  i  

 i I knocked him down  i  

 i with the hammer.  i  

 i Gods  I was strong then.  i  

Caved in his breastplate. 

Probably shattered 

every rib he had. 

 i Stood over him   i  

 i hammer in the air.  i  

Right before I brought it down 

he shouted   Wait  

Wait.  

They never tell you 

how they all shit themselves. 

They don t put that part 

in the songs. 

Stupid boy. 

 i Now the Tarlys bend the knee  i  

 i like everyone else.  i  

He could have lingered 

on the edge of the battle 

with the smart boys 

and today his wife would 

be making him miserable  

 i his sons would be ingrates   i  

and he d be waking 

three times in the night 

to piss into a bowl. 

Wine  

Lancel. 

Gods  what a stupid name. 

Lancel Lannister. 

Who named you  

Some halfwit with a stutter  

What are you doing  

  It s empty  Your Grace. 

  What do you mean it s empty  

  There s no more wine. 

  Is that what empty means  

So get more. 

Tell your cousin 

to get in here. 

Kingslayer  

Get in here. 

 i Surrounded by Lannisters.  i  

Every time I close my eyes 

I see their blond hair 

and their smug  

satisfied faces. 

It must wound your pride  huh  

Standing out there 

like a glorified sentry. 

Jaime Lannister  

son of the mighty Tywin... 

Forced to mind the door 

while your King 

eats and drinks 

and shits and fucks. 

So come on. 

We re telling war stories. 

Who was your first kill  

not counting old men  

One of the outlaws 

in the Brotherhood. 

I was there that day. 

You were only a squire  

 years old. 

You killed Simon Toyne 

with a counter riposte. 

Best move I ever saw. 

A good fighter  Toyne  

but he lacked stamina. 

 i Your outlaw...  i  

Any last words  

  I cut his head off  so no. 

  Hmmm. 

What about Aerys Targaryen  

What did the Mad King say when 

you stabbed him in the back  

I never asked. 

Did he call you a traitor  

Did he plead for a reprieve  

He said the same thing 

he d been saying for hours... 

 Burn them all.  

If that s all  Your Grace... 

Do the Dothraki buy 

their slaves  

The Dothraki don t 

believe in money. 

Most of their slaves were 

given to them as gifts. 

  From whom  

  If you rule a city 

and you see the horde approaching  

you have two choices  

Pay tribute or fight. 

An easy choice for most. 

Of course  sometimes 

it s not enough. 

Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by 

the number of slaves he s given. 

 i He might think the men too weak  i  

 i or the women too ugly.  i  

Sometimes a Khal decides his riders 

haven t had a good fight in months 

   i and need the practice.  i  

   i Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.  i  

Tell them all to stop. 

You want the entire 

horde to stop  

For how long  

Until I command them otherwise. 

You re learning 

to talk like a Queen. 

Not a Queen. 

A Khaleesi. 

Annakhas dozgosores. 

You dare  

You give commands to me  

To  i me   i  

You do not command the dragon. 

I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. 

I don t take orders 

from savages 

or their sluts. 

Do you hear me  

 i Hash shafka zali nharees   i  

 i zhey Khaleesi   i  

Rakharo ask if you want him dead  Khaleesi. 

No. 

 i Ishish chare acharoe  i  

 i hash me nem   jervae  i  

   i nharesoon.  i  

  Rakharo say you should take ear  

  to teach respect. 

  Please please  don t hurt him. 

Tell him I don t want 

my brother harmed. 

 i Khaleesi vos zalo  i  

 i meme nem azisa.  i  

Huh  

 i Shafki.  i  

Mormont  

Kill these Dothraki dogs  

I am your King  

Shall we return 

to the Khalasar  khaleesi  

Uh uh uh uh uh. 

You walk. 

I wanted to be here when you 

saw it for the first time. 

  I m leaving this morning. 

  You re leaving  

I m the First Ranger. 

My job is out there. 

  There have been disturbing reports. 

  What kind of reports  

The kind I don t 

want to believe. 

I m ready. 

I won t let you down. 

You re not going. 

You re no ranger  Jon. 

  But I m better than every   

  Better than no one  

Here... 

A man gets what he earns  

when he earns it. 

We ll speak when I return. 

  A bear s balls. 

  Oh  you re joking  

And his brains and his guts  

his lungs and his heart 

all fried in his own fat. 

When you re a hundred miles 

north of the Wall 

and you ate your last meal a week ago  

you leave nothing for the wolves. 

And how do 

a bear s balls taste  

A bit chewy. 

And what about you  My Lord  

What s the strangest thing you ve eaten  

Do Dornish girls count  

So you roam the Seven Kingdoms  

collaring pickpockets 

and horse thieves 

and bringing them here 

as eager recruits  

Aye. 

But it s not all of  em s 

done bad things. 

Some of  em s just poor lads 

looking for steady feed. 

Some of  em s high born lads 

looking for glory. 

They have a better chance finding feed 

than glory. 

The Night s Watch is 

a joke to you  is it  

Is that what we are  Lannister  

An army of jesters in black  

You don t have enough men 

to be an army 

and aside from Yoren here  none 

of you are particularly funny. 

 i I hope we ve provided you  i  

 i with some good stories to tell  i  

 i when you re back  i  

 i in King s Landing.  i  

But something to think about 

while you re drinking 

your wine down there  

enjoying your brothels   

Half the boys you ve seen training 

will die north of the Wall. 

 i Might be a wilding s axe  i  

 i that gets them   i  

 i might be sickness   i  

might just be the cold. 

They die in pain. 

And they do it so plump 

little lords like you 

can enjoy their summer 

afternoons in peace and comfort. 

Do you think I m plump  

Listen  Benjen   

May I call you Benjen  

 i Call me what you like.  i  

 i I m not sure what I ve  i  

 i done to offend you.  i  

I have great admiration 

for the Night s Watch. 

I ve great admiration 

for you as First Ranger. 

You know  my brother 

once told me 

that nothing someone says 

before the word  but  

really counts. 

But... 

I don t believe that giants 

and ghouls and White Walkers 

are lurking beyond the Wall. 

I believe that 

the only difference 

between us and 

the wildlings is that 

when the Wall went up  

our ancestors happened 

to live on 

the right side of it. 

You re right. 

The wildlings are 

no different from us. 

A little rougher maybe. 

But they re made 

of meat and bone. 

I know how to track them 

and I know how to kill them. 

It s not the wildlings 

giving me sleepless nights. 

You ve never been 

north of the Wall  

so don t tell me 

what s out there. 

Are you going below  

  Keep well  keep warm. 

  Enjoy the capital  brother. 

Oh  I always do. 

I think he s starting 

to like me. 

   Going below   

  Aye. 

Into the tunnel 

and out the other side. 

He ll be north of the Wall 

for a month or two. 

So you re heading down 

to King s Landing too. 

Aye  day after tomorrow. 

I get about half of my 

recruits from their dungeons. 

Let s share the road. 

I could use some decent company. 

I... I travel a bit 

on the grubby side  My Lord. 

Not this time. We ll be staying at 

the finest castles and inns. 

No one turns away a Lannister. 

At Jakar  

 i Athjahakar.  i  

Ath ja haker. 

 i Athjahakar.  i  

 i Athjahakar.  i  

Yes  Khaleesi. 

Oh  what are you doing  

When was last time 

you bleed  Khaleesi  

You change  Khaleesi. 

For a man on horseback  

the curved blade 

is a good thing  

easier to handle. 

It s a good weapon 

for a Dothrakan. 

But a man in full plate   

 i Shori tawakof  i  

the  i arakh  i  won t get 

through the steel. 

That s where the broadsword 

has the advantage. 

Designed for piercing plate. 

  Armor. 

  Armor. 

Armor make a man... 

   i Vroz   i  

  Slow. 

  Slow. 

  It s true  

but it also keeps a man alive. 

He still is. 

A man of great honor 

and I betrayed him. 

I don t think 

she wants to eat dog. 

The Khaleesi 

have baby inside her. 

 i It is true.  i  

 i She does not bleed for two moons.  i  

 i Her belly start to swell.  i  

 i She does not want to eat horse.  i  

I ll have the boys 

butcher a goat for supper. 

I need to ride to Qohor. 

Uh  we ride for Vaes Dothrak. 

Don t worry. 

I ll catch you. 

The horde s easy to find. 

Don t stand so still. 

It s harder to hit 

a moving target. 

Except for you. 

You move too much. 

I could just hold my sword out 

and let you do the work for me. 

 i How many winters have  i  

 i you seen  Lord Tyrion   i  

Eight   no  nine. 

All of them brief  

They say the winter of my birth was 

three years long  Maester Aemon. 

This summer has lasted nine. 

But reports from the Citadel 

tell us the days grow shorter. 

The Starks are always 

right eventually  

Winter is coming. 

This one will be long 

and dark things 

will come with it. 

We ve been capturing wildlings  

more every month. 

They re fleeing south. 

 i The ones who flee say they ve seen  i  

 i the White Walkers.  i  

Yes  and the fishermen of 

Lannisport say they see mermaids. 

One of our own rangers swore he 

saw them kill his companions. 

He swore it right up 

to the moment 

Ned Stark chopped his head off. 

 i The Night s Watch  i  

 i is the only thing  i  

standing between the realm 

and what lies beyond. 

 i And it has has become an army  i  

of undisciplined boys 

and tired old men. 

There are less than 

a thousand of us now. 

We can t man the other 

castles on the Wall. 

 i We can t properly  i  

 i patrol the wilderness.  i  

We ve barely enough resources 

to keep our lads armed 

  and fed. 

  Your sister 

sits by the side the King. 

Tell her we need help. 

 i When winter does come   i  

gods help us all 

if we re not ready. 

I m sorry to see 

you leave  Lannister. 

It s either me or this cold. 

And  i it  i  doesn t appear 

to be going anywhere. 

Will you stop at Winterfell 

on your way South  

I expect I will. 

Gods know there aren t 

many feather beds 

between here 

and King s Landing. 

If you see my brother Bran  

tell him I miss him. 

Tell him I d visit if I could. 

Of course. 

He ll never walk again. 

If you re going to be 

a cripple  

it s better to be a rich cripple. 

You take care  Snow. 

Farewell  My Lord. 

You are late  boy. 

 i Tomorrow you will  i  

 i be here at midday.  i  

Who are you  

Your dancing master  

 i Syrio Forel.  i  

Tomorrow you will catch it. 

Now pick it up. 

That is not the way  boy. 

This is not a greatsword that is 

needing two hands to swing it. 

  It s too heavy. 

  It is heavy as it needs to be 

to make you strong. 

Just so. 

One hand is all that is needed. 

Now you are standing all wrong. 

Turn your body sideface. 

Yes. 

So. 

You are skinny. 

That is good. 

The target is smaller. 

Now the grip   

Let me see. 

Yes. 

The grip must be delicate. 

What if I drop it  

The steel must be 

part of your arm. 

Can you drop 

part of your arm  No. 

Nine years Syrio Forel was first 

sword to the Sealord of Braavos. 

He knows these things. 

You must listen to me  boy. 

I m a girl. 

Boy  girl   

you are a sword  

that is all. 

That is the grip. 

You are not holding 

a battle axe. 

  You are holding   

  A needle. 

Ahhh. 

Just so. 

Now we will begin the dance. 

Remember  child  

this is not the dance of the 

Westeros we are learning   

The knight s dance  

hacking and hammering. 

This is the Bravo s dance... 

The water dance. 

It is swift 

and sudden. 

All men are made of water  

do you know this  

If you pierce them  

the water leaks out 

and they die. 

Now you will try to strike me. 

Ha  

Up  

Ha  

Ah. 

Dead. 

Oh  

Dead. 

 i Hup   i  

Very dead. 

Come. 

Ah ah ah  

 i Hup   i  

Again  faster. 

Ah. 

First Ranger  you have 

command of Castle Black. 

Lord Commander  

it is my duty to tell you 

I believe this mission 

to be reckless  foolhardy  

and an insult 

to all the brothers 

who have died 

fighting the wildlings. 

As always  thank you 

for your honesty. 

Safe travels  Lord Commander. 

Thank you  Sam. 

Oh  um... 

It s dragonglass. 

It s what I used 

to kill the white walker. 

I hope you don t need them. 

Me  too. 

Yah. 

There he is. 

That laugh. 

 i Egg.  i  

 i Egg laughed like that.  i  

 i One of the first things 

I remember.  i  

His little brother Aegon. 

He became king. 

And before that  

he was a jolly fellow  

like this one. 

Get him south  Gillyflower. 

Before it s too late. 

Theon  wait. 

Not Theon  my lady. 

Reek. 

Help me. 

You re his wife now. 

Theon. 

Do what he says. 

Do what he says 

or he ll hurt you. 

He already hurts me every night. 

All day I m locked in this room 

and every night he comes... 

It can t be any worse. 

It can. 

It can always be worse. 

  What did he do to you  

  Please. 

  You betrayed my family  

  I m sorry  I m sorry  

You have to help me. 

Theon  help me. 

He ll see us. 

You don t know him. 

My family still has 

friends in the North. 

All I need to do is give a 

signal and they ll rescue me. 

Climb to the top 

of the broken tower. 

Light this candle 

and put it in the window. 

  Promise me  Theon. 

  Reek  My name is Reek. 

Your name is Theon Greyjoy. 

Last surviving son 

of Balon Greyjoy  

Lord of the Iron Islands. 

Do you hear me  

Theon... 

promise me. 

Yes  Reek  

 i Egg.  i  

Egg. 

Mother s looking for you. 

Egg. 

Get some sleep  Sam. 

You ll have to speak 

for him tomorrow. 

You don t know that. 

Get some sleep. 

I ll watch over him. 

I m staying  too. 

He s always been good to me. 

I can t leave him now. 

Egg  

Egg. 

I dreamed... 

that I was old. 

 i His name 

was Aemon Targaryen.  i  

 i He came to us 

from King s Landing.  i  

 i A maester of the Citadel  

chained and sworn   i  

 i and sworn brother of the 

Night s Watch  ever faithful.  i  

 i No man was wiser  i  

 i or gentler or kinder.  i  

At the Wall  

a dozen lord commanders 

came and went during 

his years of service  

but he was always there 

to counsel them. 

He was the blood 

of the dragon... 

but now his fire has gone out. 

And now his watch is ended. 

And now his watch is ended. 

You re losing 

all your friends  Tarly. 

My beautiful wife. 

When my father told me 

we were marrying  

I half expected 

a fat  bearded beast. 

Do you know how pleased 

I was when I saw you  

You ve made me very happy. 

Our scouts report that Stannis 

Baratheon rides for Winterfell. 

He s a respected commander. 

His troops are loyal 

and battle tested. 

He s hired thousands of foreign 

sellswords to bolster his army. 

But this storm is a stroke 

of luck for us northerners. 

Our people are used 

to fighting in the frost. 

His army is out there now 

suffering in the snow. 

One day I ll be 

Lord of Winterfell 

and Warden of the North. 

You ll be my lady and Wardeness. 

But isn t 

your stepmother pregnant  

What of it  

What happens if she has a boy  

Then I ll have a baby brother. 

But he ll be the heir. 

I m Lord Bolton s eldest son. 

But you re a bastard. 

A trueborn will always 

have the stronger claim. 

I ve been naturalized 

by a royal decree from... 

Tommen Baratheon  

Another bastard. 

Bastards can rise 

high in the world. 

Like your half brother 

Jon Snow. 

Born the bastard of Winterfell  

now the Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch. 

You didn t know  

Yes  he s done 

very well for himself. 

Oh. 

I nearly forgot why 

I asked you to join me. 

Come  my lady. 

 i Your northern friend.  i  

Reek told me 

you wanted to leave. 

Why  

Winterfell is your home 

and I am your husband. 

Tough old bird. 

Everyone talks 

when I start peeling them. 

But this one  

her heart gave out before 

I even got to her face. 

We do breed them tough 

in the North. 

Bring my wife 

back to her chamber. 

It s far too cold 

out here for a lady. 

You should hold on 

to your candles. 

The nights are so long now. 

 i  horses 

died in the night.  i  

We ll lose more come sunset. 

We re running out of food. 

We can t open the supply 

line until the snow clears. 

What else  

The Stormcrows 

rode off last night. 

 men. 

Sellswords. 

Loyal to nothing but gold. 

We still have a hard 

march to Winterfell 

and we won t be marching 

anywhere in this weather. 

And  

This isn t our time. 

We should head back to Castle 

Black when the snow clears. 

I retreated from 

King s Landing  Ser Davos. 

If I retreat again  

I ll become the King Who Ran. 

  Your Grace... 

  Winter is coming. 

Those aren t just the Stark words. 

It s a fact. 

If we march 

back to Castle Black  

we winter at Castle Black. 

And who can say how many years 

this winter will last  

It s better to wait for the right 

time than risk everything. 

This is the right time 

and I will risk everything. 

Because if I don t  we ve lost. 

We march to victory 

or we march to defeat. 

But we go forward. 

Only forward. 

Your Grace. 

I ve trusted in your visions 

and your prophecies for years. 

You saw it yourself  my king  

when you stared into the flames. 

 i A great battle in the snow.  i  

  I don t know what I saw. 

   i You do know.  i  

Trust yourself. 

And you  

Do you trust yourself  

I trust in the Lord. 

Are you sure  

I have seen myself walk along 

the battlements of Winterfell. 

I have seen the flayed man 

banners lowered to the ground. 

But sometimes sacrifices must 

be made to ensure victory. 

I have shown you 

the power of king s blood. 

The usurper Robb Stark. 

The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. 

We don t have 

Robert s bastard here. 

No  we have someone better. 

And your blood 

runs through her veins. 

Have you lost your mind  

Do you doubt me  

Still  

After all that you ve seen. 

There must be another way. 

  Leeches or... 

  There is only one way. 

You must become king 

before the Long Night begins. 

Only you can lead 

the living against the dead. 

All your life has led us 

to this moment. 

  To this decision. 

  She s my daughter. 

Get out. 

There s always 

some sort of grub on. 

A bit of mutton would be nice. 

A beauty from beyond the Wall. 

Where you going  love  Aren t we 

better looking than the fat man  

No  the question is is she pretty 

down south in the real world 

or is she pretty  cause 

she s the only girl here  

Even in White Harbor  

I d want a kiss. 

Come on  love  give us a kiss. 

  Leave me alone.   Oh  if you were my girl  

I wouldn t leave you alone. 

  One little kiss. 

  Come on  give him a kiss. 

A man gets lonely 

guarding the Wall. 

There s no need to be rude. 

We just want a little affection. 

Ooh. 

Get your hands off her. 

Brother Derek  Brother Brant  

I believe you both 

have guard duty tonight. 

Sam the Slayer. 

You gonna slay me 

with that sword  

 i Look at his hand shake.  i  

Gilly  go on. 

Get back to your room  

lock the door. 

  I m warning you. 

  Come on. 

Come on. 

Sam  

You lying sack of shit. 

 i Killed a white walker  eh   i  

You fat ass fuck. 

Come on  get up. 

 i   No  

  This your hero  This hog   i  

Leave him alone  

Stubborn little wildling 

bitch  aren t you  

  Come on  

  No  

  Sam  Sam  Sam  

  Come on  

  Sam  Sam  

  Come on. 

 i   Right.  i  

 i I ll deal with this.  i  

 i   Turn her over. 

  All right.  i  

I said get your hands off her. 

You re gonna 

get yourself killed. 

Your lover Jon Snow s 

not here to save you. 

I killed a white walker  

I killed a Thenn. 

I ll take my chances with you. 

 i Sam   i  

  I m all right. 

  You re not. 

Just a bit woozy. 

The next time you see something 

like that  you leave it alone. 

 i I will not. 

They would have...  i  

I don t know what 

they would have done. 

I know they would have killed 

you if Ghost hadn t come. 

No. No  no. 

They were tiring out. 

I had them 

in the palm of my hand. 

Don t be stupid  Sam. 

You re not a fighter. 

What kind of man would I be 

if I ran away when I saw 

someone hurting you  

Just promise me 

whatever happens  you ll 

take care of Little Sam. 

But of course I will. 

And... 

I ll take care of you  too. 

I need more water. 

Stay. 

 i Please   i  

Am I hurting you  

Are you sure  

Oh  my  

 i A rare find for the 

fighting pits  my friends.  i  

Not your usual street tough 

or drunken pirate. 

This one s a Westerosi knight 

from an ancient house 

trained in sword and lance. 

He fought beside 

the stag king Robert 

on the far side 

of the Narrow Sea. 

He was first through the breach 

during the Siege of Spike  

slaughtering  men 

with his flaming sword. 

He killed the great Khal 

Drogo in single combat. 

Betrayed by his woman  

he sold himself into slavery 

to repay his debts. 

 i Bidding begins at  gold honors.  i  

. 

Do I have   

 gold honors. 

Do I hear   

. 

Sold. 

Wait  You have 

to buy me as well. 

Why  

We re a team. 

I m a great fighter  too. 

He s funny. 

You have to give him that. 

You re right  he s funny. 

Thank you  my lord. 

Thank you. 

Yes. 

My lord  if I may. 

I ve heard Meereen 

has become a free city. 

You might run into trouble if you try 

to fight slaves in the fighting pits. 

Now  if you were to fight freed 

men who d be paid a wage... 

There s your wages  funny man. 

Should last the rest 

of your life. 

These are warrior 

hands  not a serving girl s. 

  going once... 

How long before the King of 

Meereen comes to claim my pillow  

Don t be ridiculous. 

My marriage to Hizdahr 

is political. 

I think he s smart enough 

to understand that. 

I think the Sons of the 

Harpy have stopped killing 

because their leader 

was made king. 

Are you jealous  

You think I m petty enough 

to speak ill of a man 

just because he 

represents competition  

I do. 

You re right. 

My motivations 

are entirely impure. 

Doesn t make me wrong. 

You told me yourself I can t fight 

enemies within and without. 

So when enemies without 

come knocking  

I need the city 

of Meereen behind me. 

I have no choice. 

Everyone has a choice. 

Even slaves 

have a choice... 

Death or slavery. 

So what else can I do  hmm  

Marry me instead. 

Even if I wanted to do 

such an inadvisable thing  

I couldn t. 

Why not  

You are queen. 

You can do what you like. 

No  I can t. 

Then you are the only person 

in Meereen who s not free. 

And I know I m here to serve 

my queen and not give advice  

but can I make 

one more suggestion  

Of course. 

On the day of the great games  

gather all the Great 

Masters and Wise Masters 

and Worthy Masters you can find 

and slaughter them all. 

I am a queen  not a butcher. 

All rulers are either 

butchers or meat. 

You there. Where would 

I find the High Septon 

or High Sparrow or whatever 

bloody fool name he s got  

It s not as good a name as 

Queen of Thorns  I ll admit. 

You should have the decency 

to stand when 

you speak to a lady. 

You should have the decency 

to kneel before the gods. 

Don t spar with me  

little fellow. 

For me  it s the knees. 

  You  

  Hips. 

Ah. 

A man of the people. 

Is that your game  

It s an old game. 

Dull and unconvincing. 

A man of the people 

who does Cersei s 

dirty work for her. 

The people always 

do the dirty work. 

Spare me the homilies. I can 

smell a fraud from a mile away. 

Useful talent. 

I m here for my grandson 

and granddaughter. 

Your grandson and granddaughter 

swore sacred vows and lied. 

The Father judges us all. 

Sons of high lords  

sons of fishermen. 

If you break his laws  

you will be punished. 

Don t you walk away from me. 

You don t give commands 

here  Lady Olenna. 

What is it you want  

Gold  

I ll make you the richest 

septon who ever lived. 

What  then  

I imagine this 

is strange for you. 

Everyone you meet 

has a hidden motive 

and you pride yourself 

on sniffing it out. 

 i But I m telling you 

a simple truth.  i  

I serve the gods. 

The gods demand justice. 

How do they communicate 

their demands  

By raven or horse  

By the holy text  

 The Seven Pointed Star.  

If you don t have one 

in your library  

 i I ll give you my own.  i  

I ve read 

 The Seven Pointed Star.  

 i Then you ll remember the passages 

concerning buggery and perjury.  i  

Your grandchildren 

will be punished 

in the same manner as anyone 

who breaks the sacred laws. 

Half the men  

women  and children 

in this foul city 

break the sacred laws. 

You live among murderers  

thieves  and rapists  

and yet you punish Loras 

for shagging some perfumed ponce 

and Margaery for defending 

her brother  

Yes. The gods  laws must 

be applied to all equally. 

If it s equality 

you want  so be it. 

When House Tyrell stops sending 

our crops to the capital  

everyone here will starve. 

And I ll make sure the 

hungry know who s to blame. 

Have you ever sowed the 

field  Lady Olenna  

Have you ever reaped the grain  

Has anyone in House Tyrell  

A lifetime of wealth and power 

has left you blind in one eye. 

You are the few  

we are the many. 

And when the many 

stop fearing the few... 

Lady Olenna. 

Starving yourself 

won t make things 

any better for her  my love. 

She s in a prison cell 

and there is nothing I can do. 

I am the king  

The queen is in prison and 

there is nothing I can do  

No matter who you are  

no matter how strong 

you are  sooner or later  

you ll face circumstances 

beyond your control. 

Events you couldn t 

possibly have anticipated 

or prevented even if you had. 

You cannot blame 

yourself for fate. 

Your father  

your brother  

your grandfather... 

I was Queen of the Seven 

Kingdoms and what could I do  

Hold them as they 

left this world. 

Kissed their heads 

after they d gone. 

I ll call in the army. 

I ll take back the sept 

and kill every last one of them. 

I ll start a war if I have to. 

You know as well as I do who the 

first casualty of that war would be. 

I love her. 

I love her... 

and I can t help her. 

We must be strong 

for those we love. 

We cannot give in to despair. 

I will speak 

with the High Sparrow. 

There must be 

something he... 

Let me talk to him 

on your behalf. 

The king cannot sully himself 

negotiating with an unwashed fanatic. 

You will try to help her  

I ll do everything I can to win 

her freedom and her brother s. 

Your happiness is all 

I want in this world. 

  I know. 

  No  you don t. 

You can t possibly. 

Not until you have 

children of your own. 

I would do anything for you. 

Anything to keep you from harm. 

I would burn cities 

to the ground. 

You are all that matters. 

You and your sister. 

From the moment you came 

into this world. 

My boy. 

My only boy. 

Prince Doran hopes 

this satisfies 

your concerns about the 

princess s well being. 

You looked different 

when I left. 

You had more hair. 

And more hands. 

  How s Trystane  

  He ll be all right. 

I m sorry for that. 

It wasn t supposed 

to happen that way. 

Why is it happening at all  

Your mother s worried about you. 

Threats have been made. 

Dorne s too dangerous for you. 

  I ve come to take you home. 

  This is my home. 

This has been my home for years. 

I didn t want to come here  

but she told me to. 

I did what she said. 

I did my duty and now 

she s forcing me to go back  

It s for your own good. 

These are complicated matters. 

 i No  it s not complicated at all. 

It s simple.  i  

I love Trystane  

I m going to marry him  

and we re staying right here. 

  I don t understand. 

  Of course you don t. 

You don t know me. 

 i     Brothers  O brothers  

my days here are done      i  

 i     The Dornishman s 

taken my life      i  

    But what does it matter     

    For all men must die 

    And I ve tasted 

the Dornishman s wife     

    I have  I ve tasted 

the Dornishman s wife.     

He s got a good voice. 

We re lucky he s a singer. 

If he were a fighter  we 

might have been in trouble. 

It s against my code 

to hurt a woman. 

It s amazing how many men we 

beat seem to have this code. 

I wouldn t say you beat me. 

How s your arm  

Wonderful. 

Wouldn t feel right to leave 

Dorne without a new scar. 

You think you re leaving Dorne  

No great hurry. 

Dornish women are the most 

beautiful women in the world. 

Thank you. 

I said Dornish women. 

I didn t say you. 

I m not the most beautiful 

woman you ve ever seen  

 i I ve seen 

quite a few women  i  

 i in all the Seven Kingdoms.  i  

Name one more beautiful 

than I am. 

Well  now  in King s Landing  

 i there was an absolutely 

gorgeous...  i  

There was a what  

In King s Landing  

you were saying  

Was I  

There was a woman 

more beautiful than I am. 

Was there  

My memory s not 

what it was earlier. 

How s your arm now  

You seem concerned with it. 

 i You must really like me.  i  

And how about your head  

 i My head   i  

My head  

You don t even want to 

know what s going on in... 

Your nose is bleeding. 

It s nothing. 

It s the dry air. 

My dagger was coated with a 

special ointment from Asshai. 

 i They call it the Long Farewell.  i  

It takes time to work  

but if a single drop 

makes contact with the skin  

death. 

The only antidote. 

Who s the most beautiful 

woman in the world  

You. 

Sorry  Who  

You. 

Don t drop it. 

I think you re 

very handsome as well. 

  I m sorry about the locale. 

  No  you re not. 

It felt like the safest place. 

Not for your clientele  clearly. 

It was an establishment 

like no other. 

The sheer range 

of appetites catered to. 

Desires that didn t even exist 

until we invented them. 

You ve always been rather impressed 

with yourself  haven t you  

The past is the past. 

The future is all 

that s worth discussing. 

The future of House Tyrell. 

Don t pretend to have 

any concern for my house  

my grandchildren or me. 

I should have known 

you d return to the capital 

as soon as things 

started to go wrong. 

  I promise you... 

  I promise you  Lord Baelish  

that our fates are joined. 

Together we murdered a king. 

If my house should fall  

I will have nothing to hide. 

And if I should meet 

with some accident 

here at your broken 

little flesh market  

they ll never even find 

what s left of you. 

So... 

do you deny a part in all this  

Cersei summoned me 

to King s Landing. 

I dared not refuse her. 

And what did she want  

A piece of information 

she knew that I had. 

Neither silence 

nor lies were an option. 

But I have other information 

of which she is unaware. 

And as you say  

our interests are aligned. 

I have a gift for you. 

What kind of gift  

The same kind I gave Cersei. 

A handsome young man. 

 i Many worthy 

fighters have died  i  

 i trying to make it 

to the great games.  i  

When most of you worthless scum 

join them in death this afternoon  

it will represent a significant 

rise in your station. 

But if you do happen 

to triumph here  

 i you will fight at the Great 

Pit of Daznak itself  i  

 i in front of the queen.  i  

So whatever happens  the gods 

have smiled upon you today. 

This is the day your lives 

actually start to mean something. 

You and you. 

You. 

You two. 

 i You  you  and you.  i  

Up. 

 i   Valar morghulis. 

  Valar dohaeris.  i  

Prepare yourselves. 

Sitting through the great 

games will be bad enough. 

For generations in the days 

leading up to the great games  

it has been customary 

for our ruler 

to make the rounds 

of the lower pits 

to pay the fighters there 

the honor of her presence. 

 i Move yourselves.  i  

Your Grace. 

Your future Grace. 

You honor us all. 

Stand there. 

Stand straight. 

That s the fucking queen. 

We fight and 

die for your glory  

O glorious queen. 

We fight and 

die for your glory  

 i O glorious queen.  i  

 i Fight   i  

I think I ve seen enough. 

Your Grace  it is a tradition 

for the queen to stay 

until the victor has emerged. 

I ve sacrificed more than 

enough for your traditions. 

What are you doing  

Wait your turn  

you piece of fucking filth. 

Get him out of my sight. 

Khaleesi  please. 

I just need 

a moment of your time. 

I brought you a gift. 

 i It s true.  i  

He has. 

Who are you  

I am the gift. 

 i It s a pleasure 

to meet you  Your Grace.  i  

My name is Tyrion Lannister. 

This is horrible. 

Unacceptable. 

Are they feeding you 

enough at least  

I brought you this. 

Venison. 

It s quite good. 

I had it myself for supper 

only last night. 

We did everything we could from the 

moment they took your brother. 

Tommen even went 

to the sept himself 

to confront the High Sparrow. 

But I fear the Faith 

has left reason behind. 

I know you did this. 

We are making every effort 

on your behalf. 

I swear to you 

by all the seven gods. 

Lies come easily to you. 

Everyone knows that. 

 i But innocence   i  

 i decency  concern   i  

you re not very good 

at those  I m afraid. 

Perhaps that s why 

your son was so eager 

to cast you aside for me. 

You re upset. 

You re not thinking clearly. 

I ll visit again when you ve 

had a chance to calm down. 

I don t want to see you again. 

I do hope you change 

your mind about that. 

I ve been told men often go mad 

in the Black Cells 

beneath the Red Keep. 

Though I suppose 

your isolation will end 

when your trial begins. 

Leave. 

Yes. 

I m afraid I must. 

 i My son needs me now 

more than ever.  i  

Get out  you hateful bitch  

Sleep well  sister. 

Thank you  Boake. 

  You saw her  

  Yes. 

  And  

  Her accommodations seem sufficient. 

What happens to her now  

Well  she and her brother 

are both being held 

under fair suspicion. 

A trial will be held 

for each of them 

to determine if they re 

guilty of any acts 

that might constitute a violation 

of the tenets of the faith. 

Who will stand judge  

Seven septons as it was in all 

trials before the Targaryens. 

Will you be one of them  

I will. 

If one or both of them 

were to confess 

before the trial... 

Then they will be shown 

the Mother s mercy. 

And what does 

the Mother s mercy entail  

It depends upon the situation. 

The acts themselves  

the degree of contrition. 

Thank you  High Septon  

for bringing them whatever 

justice they deserve 

 i in the eyes of the Seven.  i  

 i Did you know this chapel  i  

is one of the oldest 

structures in King s Landing  

I think I may have 

heard at one point. 

Baelor built his sept around it. 

But men worshipped here 

long before him. 

Who carved this altar  

  Do you know  

  I m afraid I don t. 

No one does. 

There s no name on it or 

anywhere else in the chapel. 

No  the people 

who built this place 

didn t inflict their vanity 

on those who came after them 

the way Baelor did with that great 

gilded monstrosity up there. 

Hmm. 

Their faith was clean. 

Strip away the gold 

and the ornaments  

knock down the statues 

and the pillars  

and this is what remains. 

Something simple... 

and solid and true. 

The Tyrells  finery 

will be stripped away. 

 i Their lies knocked down.  i  

 i Their true hearts 

laid bare for all to see.  i  

And so it will be for all of us. 

High and low alike. 

What will we find 

when we strip away your finery  

A young man came to us 

not long ago. 

Broken in body and spirit. 

He had so much to strip away. 

 i So much weighing him down.  i  

 i But piece by piece  

he unburdened himself.  i  

 i Let go of vanity   i  

pride  sin. 

Now his soul is so light  

he will float through the 

Seven Heavens like a bird. 

Hmm. 

And he has much 

to say about you. 

Move. 

Let me go immediately. 

You will order her to let me go. 

I am the queen  

I am the queen  

Have you lost your mind  

Let me go  

 i Get your filthy hands off me   i  

 i Have you lost your mind   i  

 i I am the queen  

Let me go   i  

Look at me. 

Look at my face. 

It s the last thing 

you ll see before you die. 

The war is over. Winter has come. 

The war is not over. 

The true enemy won t wait out the storm. 

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

Our uncle Euron returned 

home after a long absence. 

He murdered our father  and 

took the Salt Throne from Yara. 

He would have murdered 

us if we d stayed. 

Build me a thousand ships  

and I will give you this world. 

There s a storm coming. 

You ll be wanting a roof tonight. 

I don t have much  but I 

have hidden a bit of silver 

from the bandits. 

What did you do   

They ll both be dead come winter. 

Cold winds are rising in the North. 

We need good men to help us. 

You can still help a lot more 

than you ve harmed  Clegane. 

It s not too late for you. 

Send me to Oldtown. 

I m to be the new maester. 

The Citadel has the 

world s greatest library. 

I ll learn about things 

that all help when... 

... when they come. 

Let go of me  

Are you sure you re ready for this  

I m the three eyed raven. 

I have to be ready for this. 

Do you know who had this table 

carved and painted  Ser Davos  

Aegon Targaryen. 

Aegon used to live here  and 

the Targaryens built this castle. 

Aye. So they did. 

I want us both to go home. 

But they took it from us. 

How do we go home  

You re in the great game now  

and the great game s 

terrifying. Are you afraid  

My name is Arya Stark. 

I want you to know that. 

You re wondering why 

I brought you all here. 

After all  we just had a feast. 

Since when does old Walder 

give us two feasts 

in a single fortnight  

Well  it s no good being 

Lord of the Riverlands 

if you can t celebrate with your family. 

That s what I say  

Yes  

I ve gathered every Frey 

who means a damn thing 

so I can tell you my 

plans for this great house 

now that winter has come. 

But first  a toast  

No more of that Dornish horse piss  

This is the finest Arbor gold  

Proper wine for proper heroes  

Stand together  

Stand together  

Not you. 

I m not wasting good 

wine on a damn woman. 

Maybe I m not the most pleasant man. 

I ll admit it. But I m proud of you lot. 

You re my family  the men who helped me 

slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding. 

Yes  yes. 

Cheer. 

Brave men  all of you. 

Butchered a woman 

pregnant with her babe. 

Cut the throat of a mother of five. 

Slaughtered your guests 

after inviting them 

into your home. 

But you didn t slaughter 

every one of the Starks. 

No  no  that was your mistake. 

You should have ripped 

them all out  root and stem. 

Leave one wolf alive 

and the sheep are never safe. 

When people ask you 

what happened here... 

tell them the North remembers. 

Tell them winter came for House Frey. 

You wildlings  

I m Meera Reed  

daughter of Howland Reed. 

This is Brandon Stark  

son of Ned Stark. 

How do I know that s true  

You were at the Fist of the First Men. 

You were at Hardhome. 

You ve seen the Army of the Dead. 

You ve seen the Night King. 

He s coming for us. 

For all of us. 

Okay  come on. 

Let s get them inside. 

I want every northern 

maester to scour their records 

for any mention of dragonglass. 

Dragonglass kills white walkers. 

It s more valuable to us now than gold. 

We need to find it  we need to mine it  

we need to make weapons from it. 

Everyone aged  to  

will drill daily with 

spears  pikes  bow and arrow. 

It s about time we taught these 

boys of summer how to fight. 

Not just the boys. 

We can t defend the North 

if only half the population is fighting. 

You expect me to put a spear 

in my granddaughter s hand  

I don t plan on knitting by 

the fire while men fight for me. 

I might be small  Lord 

Glover  and I might be a girl  

but I am every bit as 

much a Northerner as you. 

Indeed you are  my lady. 

No one has questioned... 

And I don t need your 

permission to defend the North. 

We ll begin training every man  

woman  boy  and girl on Bear Island. 

Aye  

While we re preparing for attack  

we need to shore up our defenses. 

The only thing standing between us 

and the Army of the Dead is the Wall  

and the Wall hasn t been 

properly manned in centuries. 

I m not the king of the Free Folk. 

But if we re going to survive 

this winter together... 

You want us to man the castles for you  

Aye. 

Last time we saw the 

Night King was at Hardhome. 

The closest castle to Hardhome 

is Eastwatch by the Sea. 

Then that s where I ll go. 

Looks like we re the Night s Watch now. 

If they breach the Wall  

the first two castles in their path 

are Last Hearth and Karhold. 

The Umbers and the 

Karstarks betrayed the North. 

Their castles should be torn down 

with not a stone left standing. 

The castles committed no crimes. 

And we need every fortress 

we have for the war to come. 

We should give the Last Hearth 

and Karhold to new families  

loyal families who 

supported us against Ramsay. 

Aye  

The Umbers and the Karstarks 

have fought beside the 

Starks for centuries. 

They ve kept faith for 

generation after generation. 

And then they broke faith. 

I m not going to strip these 

families of their ancestral homes 

because of the crimes 

of a few reckless sons. 

So there s no punishment for treason 

and no reward for loyalty  

The punishment for treason is death. 

Smalljon Umber died 

on the field of battle. 

Harald Karstark died 

on the field of battle. 

They died fighting for Ramsay. 

Give the castles to the families 

of the men who died fighting for you. 

When I was Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch... 

I executed men who betrayed me. 

I executed men who 

refused to follow orders. 

My father always said  

 The man who passes the 

sentence should swing the sword   

and I have tried to live by those words. 

But I will not punish a 

son for his father s sins  

and I will not take a family home away 

from a family it has 

belonged to for centuries. 

That is my decision  

and my decision is final. 

Ned Umber. 

Alys Karstark. 

For centuries  our families fought 

side by side on the battlefield. 

I ask you to pledge your loyalty 

once again to House Stark  

to serve as our bannermen 

and come to our aid 

whenever called upon. 

Stand. 

Yesterday s wars don t matter anymore. 

The North needs to band together  

all the living north. 

Will you stand beside me  Ned and Alys  

now and always  

Now and always  

You are my sister  but I am king now. 

Will you start wearing a crown  

When you question my decisions 

in front of the other lords 

and ladies  you undermine me. 

So I can t question 

your decisions anymore  

Of course you can  but... 

Joffrey never let anyone 

question his authority. 

You think he was a good king  

Do you think I m Joffrey  

You re as far from Joffrey 

as anyone I ve ever met. 

Thank you. 

You re good at this  you know. 

  At what  

  At ruling. 

No. 

You are. 

You are. 

They respect you  they really do  

but you have to... 

Why are you laughing  

What did father used to say  

Everything before the 

word  but  is horse shit. 

He never said that to me. 

No. No  he never cursed 

in front of his girls. 

Because he was trying to protect us. 

He never wanted us to see 

how dirty the world really is  

but Father couldn t protect 

me and neither can you. 

Stop trying. 

All right  I ll stop 

trying to protect you 

and you stop trying to undermine me. 

I m not trying to undermine you  

You have to be smarter than Father. 

You need to be smarter than Robb. 

I loved them  I miss them  

but they made stupid mistakes  

and they both lost their heads for it. 

And how should I be smarter  

By listening to you  

Would that be so terrible  

A raven from King s Landing  Your Grace. 

 Cersei of House Lannister  

First of Her Name  

Queen of the Andals and the First Men  

Protector of the Seven Kingdoms...  

What does she want  

Come to King s Landing. 

Bend the knee or suffer 

the fate of all traitors. 

You ve been so consumed 

with the enemy to the north  

you ve forgotten about 

the one to the south. 

I m consumed with the Night 

King because I ve seen him. 

And believe me  you d think 

of little else if you had  too. 

We still have a wall between 

us and the Night King. 

There s nothing between us and Cersei. 

There s a thousand miles 

between us and Cersei. 

Winter is here. The 

Lannisters are a southern army. 

They ve never ranged this far north. 

You re the military man  but I know her. 

If you re her enemy  she ll never 

stop until she s destroyed you. 

Everyone who s ever crossed 

her  she s found a way to murder. 

You almost sound as if you admire her. 

I learned a great deal from her. 

What is this  

It s what we ve been 

waiting for our whole lives. 

It s what Father trained us 

for  whether he knew it or not. 

He knew it. 

Made me memorize every damn city  town  

lake  forest  and mountain. 

It s ours now. We just have to take it. 

You ve been quiet since you came home. 

Are you angry with me  

No  not angry. 

Are you afraid of me  

Should I be  

Daenerys Targaryen has 

chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. 

Right now  they re sailing 

across the Narrow Sea  

hoping to take back her father s throne. 

Our little brother  

the one you love so much  

the one you set free  

the one who murdered our 

father and our first born son  

now he stands beside our 

enemies and gives them counsel. 

He s out there somewhere 

at the head of an armada. 

Where will they land  

Dragonstone. 

They have deep water 

ports for the ships. 

Stannis left the castle unoccupied  

and that s where she was born. 

Enemies to the east. 

Enemies to the south... 

Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches. 

Enemies to the west... 

Olenna  the old cunt. 

Another traitor. 

Enemies to the north. 

Ned Stark s bastard has 

been named King in the North 

and that murdering whore 

Sansa stands beside him. 

Enemies everywhere. We re 

surrounded by traitors. 

You re in command of 

the Lannister army now. 

  How do we proceed  

  Winter is here. 

We can t win a war if we can t 

feed our men and our horses. 

The Tyrells have the grain  

the Tyrells have the livestock. 

Will the Tyrell 

bannermen stand alongside 

a Dothraki horde and 

Unsullied slave soldiers  

If they think Daenerys will win. 

No one wants to fight 

on the losing side. 

Right now  we look like the losing side. 

I m the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. 

Three kingdoms  at best. 

I m not sure you understand 

how much danger we re in. 

I understand we re 

in a war for survival. 

I understand whoever loses dies. 

I understand whoever wins 

could launch a dynasty 

that lasts a thousand years. 

A dynasty for whom  

Our children are dead. 

We re the last of us. 

A dynasty for us  then. 

We never talked about Tommen. 

There s nothing to say. 

Our baby boy killed himself. 

He betrayed me. 

He betrayed us both. 

Should we spend our 

days mourning the dead... 

Mother  father  and all our children  

  Cersei... 

  I loved them. I did. 

But they re ashes now and 

we re still flesh and blood. 

We re the last Lannisters  

the last ones who count. 

Even Lannisters can t 

survive without allies. 

Where are our allies now  

You saw what happened to 

Walder Frey and his family. 

I heard. 

  How could we ever trust a man like that  

  We couldn t. 

He was a useless  old coward  

but the Freys supported us. 

Now they re all dead. 

Whoever killed them 

is no friend of ours. 

We need allies. 

Stronger  better allies. 

We can t win this war alone. 

You think I listened to Father 

for  years and learned nothing  

The Greyjoys  

You invited the Greyjoys 

to King s Landing  

  Not all of them. 

  Well  it looks like all of them. 

I invited Euron Greyjoy  

the new King of the Iron Islands. 

You said yourself we needed 

stronger  better allies. 

  There you are. 

  How are they better allies  

How are they different from the Freys  

They both broke their promises 

and murdered their former 

friends as soon as it suited them. 

So does everyone when it suits them. 

Unlike the Freys  they have ships. 

  And they re good at killing. 

  They re not good at anything. 

I know the ironborn. They re 

bitter  angry little people. 

All they know how to do is steal things 

they can t build or grow themselves. 

Euron Greyjoy didn t come here for that. 

Oh  what did he come here for  then  

A queen. 

The moment I was chosen 

Lord of the Iron Islands  

they turned on me. 

Their own uncle. 

They stole my best ships and ran. 

Sailed them right across the world 

and gave them to the Dragon Queen 

so she could bring her 

armies here to attack you. 

It s nothing compared to 

the treason you suffered 

at the hands of a family 

member  from what I hear. 

But still  it bothers me. 

Murdering them would 

make me feel a lot better. 

And since it appears that all 

our treasonous family members 

are fighting for the same side  

I thought we rightful monarchs 

could murder them together. 

You re not a rightful 

monarch  though  are you  

The Greyjoys rebelled against the 

throne for the right to be monarchs  

but as I recall  you 

were soundly defeated. 

Come to mention it  

weren t you the one who 

started that rebellion 

by sailing to Casterly Rock 

and burning the Lannister fleet  

You certainly caught us there. 

Very smart move on your part. 

Of course  we all made it 

to the Iron Islands anyway. 

I was there. 

I remember very well. 

I saw you. 

I heard so much talk. 

The best in the world. 

No one can stop him. 

I didn t believe it  to be honest. 

But I must say when you 

rushed through the breach 

and started cutting people down... 

it was glorious. 

Like a dance. 

The people I was cutting 

down were your own kin. 

The place was getting crowded. 

I enjoyed watching it. I truly did. 

And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys. 

A good thing for me. 

If you hadn t crushed us  I 

wouldn t have gone into exile. 

If I hadn t done that  

I wouldn t be the greatest 

captain on the  seas. 

If not the most humble. 

You re not humble. 

You re the queen of a great nation. 

You don t care about the Iron Islands. 

They re nothing but 

rocks and bird shit and... 

And a lot of very unattractive people. 

The Iron Fleet  on the other hand  

that s something else entirely. 

It s the greatest armada 

Westeros has ever seen. 

With the Iron Fleet  you own the seas. 

You can defeat the invaders of the east 

and the pretenders of 

the north and south. 

What do you want in return  

Ever since I was a little boy  

I wanted to grow up and marry 

the most beautiful woman in the world. 

So here I am  

with a thousand ships 

and two good hands. 

I decline your proposal. 

Why  

You re not trustworthy. 

You ve broken promises to allies before 

and murdered them at 

the nearest opportunity. 

You murdered your own brother. 

You should try it. Feels wonderful. 

I don t expect you to trust me outright. 

You need proof of my honest intentions. 

In my experience  

the surest way to a woman s 

heart is with a gift. 

A priceless gift. 

I won t return to King s Landing 

until I have that for you. 

Ah  Maester Weyland. 

A drinker s liver if ever I saw one. 

Weigh that. 

The triumph of transitory pleasures. 

Mankind s curse. 

Archmaester  I was wondering... 

What s the weight  

Um  . 

I was wondering if you had 

considered my proposition. 

I don t remember your proposition. 

I asked you if  in light of 

what I ve seen in the North  

if I could have access to the 

restricted area of the library. 

That area is reserved for maesters. 

  Are you a maester  

  No. 

Not a very strong proposition  is it  

Archmaester  with respect  

I ve seen them... 

The Army of the Dead. 

The white walkers. 

I was sent here to 

learn how to defeat them  

but everyone in the Citadel  

those who will even talk to me  

they all doubt the walkers 

ever existed in the first place. 

Everyone in the Citadel 

doubts everything. 

It s their job. 

But the tales of the Long 

Night can t be pure fabrication. 

Too many similarities 

from unconnected sources. 

Sources in the restricted area  

The very same. 

And the simplest explanation 

for your grating obsession 

with the white walkers 

is that you re telling the truth 

and that you saw what you say you saw. 

So  you believe me. 

I do. 

You ll finish weighing that heart  

That makes you the only person 

south of the Twins who does. 

We re not like the 

people south of the Twins. 

And we re not like the 

people north of the Twins. 

In the Citadel  we lead different 

lives for different reasons. 

We are this world s 

memory  Samwell Tarly. 

Without us  men would be 

little better than dogs. 

Don t remember any meal but the last  

can t see forward to any but the next. 

And every time you leave 

the house and shut the door  

they howl like you re gone forever. 

When Robert s Rebellion was raging  

people thought the end was near. 

The end of the Targaryen 

dynasty.  How will we survive   

When Aegon Targaryen 

turned his eye westward 

and flew his dragons 

to Blackwater Rush... 

 The end is near  How will we survive   

And thousands of years before 

that  during the Long Night  

we can forgive them for 

thinking it truly was the end. 

But it wasn t. None of it was. 

The Wall has stood through it all. 

And every winter that 

ever came has ended. 

Be a good lad. Clean this up. 

Nope. 

Nope. 

You re a lucky man. 

I ve heard she beat the 

Hound in single combat. 

She s a very impressive woman. 

What do you want  Lord Baelish  

I want you to be happy. 

I want you to be safe. 

I am safe. 

I m at home  surrounded by friends. 

I have Brienne to protect me 

from anyone who would harm me. 

What about happy  

Why aren t you happy  

What do you want that you do not have  

At the moment  peace and quiet. 

No need to seize the 

last word  Lord Baelish. 

I ll assume it was something clever. 

My lady. 

My lady. 

Why is he still here  

We need his men. 

Without the Vale  Ramsay Bolton 

would still hold this castle. 

Littlefinger saved us. 

He wants something. 

I know exactly what he wants. 

    He rode through the 

streets of the city     

    Down from his hill on high     

    O er the winds and the 

steps and the cobbles     

    He rode to a woman s sigh     

    For she was his secret treasure     

    She was his shame and his bliss     

    And a chain and 

a keep are nothing     

    Compared to a woman s kiss     

    For hands of gold 

are always cold     

    But a woman s hands are warm     

    For hands of gold 

are always cold     

    But a woman s hands are...     

That s a pretty song. 

I ve never heard it before. 

It s a new one. 

Are you hungry  We ve got some rabbit. 

I don t want to steal your food. 

You re not stealing  we re offering. 

Come on  it s gonna be a cold night. 

You heading south  

King s Landing. 

Poor girl. 

Not so bad  is it  

Depends on your taste  I guess. 

If you like your streets 

covered in shit and pig s blood  

it s the town for you. 

All my life  I wanted 

to see the Red Keep  

the Sept of Baelor  the Dragonpit. 

Then when I finally make it  

they wouldn t let me within 

a mile of the Red Keep  

the Sept of Baelor s blown to hell  

and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin. 

The people who live there  

they d skin you alive if they could 

make two coppers off your hide. 

Worst place in the world. 

What are you doing in the Riverlands  

There s been some trouble 

with the Freys up at the Twins  

so we re part of the army that s 

been sent to keep the peace. 

Here you go. Guests first. 

Oh  no  I couldn t. 

You don t have enough. 

My mother always told me 

to be kind to strangers. 

Strangers will be kind to you. 

You re a long way from home. 

I m sure you ve had 

some adventures  though. 

Yeah  endless adventures. 

They ll be singing about 

us for a thousand years. 

The truth is when we left home  

we couldn t wait to get away. 

But now we ve been gone a 

while  we can t wait to get home. 

I just think about my dad out 

there on his boat all alone. 

I ought to be out there with him. 

My wife just had our first baby. 

  Boy or girl  

  Oh  who knows  

You think soldiers get 

ravens with news from home  

  I hope it s a girl. 

  Why  

Girls take care of their papas 

when their papas grow old. 

Boys just go off to fight 

in someone else s wars. 

Are you old enough to drink  

It s blackberry wine. 

I made it myself. 

It s really good. 

So  why is a nice girl on her 

own heading to King s Landing  

I m going to kill the queen. 

Bad night to be outdoors. 

You ve got real powerful 

magic to figure that out. 

Did the Lord of Light 

whisper that in your ear  

 It s snowing  Thoros. It s windy. 

It s gonna be a cold night.  

You re a grouchy old 

bear  aren t you  Clegane  

You want some rum  

Don t like that shit. It s too sweet. 

Why are you always in such a foul mood  

Experience. 

This seems like a good 

place to spend the night. 

These people don t want us here. 

Seems deserted to me. No livestock. 

No smoke coming from the chimney. 

I don t like the look of it. 

For a big  hard man  you scare easy. 

I ll tell you what doesn t scare me... 

Bald cocksuckers like you. 

You think you re fooling 

anyone with that top knot  

Bald cunt. 

Come on. 

Maybe they ve got some ale hidden away. 

They don t. 

See if there s a larder. 

They always leave something behind. 

How do you think it ended for them  

With death. 

Girl died in her father s arms. 

Both of them covered in blood 

and a knife at their feet. 

I d say they were starving. 

And rather than let 

his little girl suffer  

he ended it for both of them. 

Doesn t matter now. 

No  doesn t matter now. 

I ve known you a long time  Dondarrion. 

Aye. 

I think the first time we 

met was at that tournament... 

And I always thought 

you were dull as dirt. 

You re not bad. 

I don t hate you. 

Don t like you  but you re not bad. 

Thank you  Clegane. 

That warms the heart. 

But there s nothing special about you. 

You re right about that. 

So why does the Lord of 

Light keep bringing you back  

I ve met better men than you  

and they ve been hanged 

from crossbeams  or beheaded  

or just shat themselves to 

death in a field somewhere. 

None of them came back. 

So  why you  

You think I don t ask myself that  

Every hour of every day  

Why am I here  

What am I supposed to do  

What does the Lord see in me  

And  

I don t know. 

I don t understand our Lord. 

Your Lord. 

I don t know what He wants from me. 

I only know that He wants me alive. 

If he s so all powerful  

why doesn t he just tell you 

what the fuck he wants  

Clegane. 

Come over here. 

Don t worry. The fire won t bite. 

I want to show you something. 

It s my fucking luck I end up 

with a band of fire worshippers. 

Aye. 

Almost seems like divine justice. 

There s no divine 

justice  you dumb cunt. 

If there was  you d be dead... 

and that girl would be alive. 

  What do you want  

  Look into the flames. 

I don t want to look in the damn flames. 

You saw me bring him back from 

the dead after you cut him down. 

Don t you want to know 

what gave me the power  

I keep asking and no 

one wants to tell me. 

We can t tell you. 

Only the fire can tell you. 

What do you see  

Logs burning. 

Keep looking. 

What do you see  

Ice. 

A wall of ice. 

The Wall. 

What else  

It s where the Wall meets the sea. 

There s a castle there. 

There s a mountain. 

Looks like an arrowhead. 

The dead are marching past. 

Thousands of them. 

Do you believe me now  Clegane  

Do you believe we re here for a reason  

What the hell are you doing  Clegane  

Burying the dead. 

You knew these people. 

Not really. 

We ask the Father to 

judge us with mercy. 

We ask the Mother to... 

Fuck it  I don t remember the rest. 

I m sorry you re dead. 

You deserved better. 

Both of you. 

Hey. 

Mom. 

You should really sleep  Sam. 

The dead don t. 

 Legends of the Long Night.  

The Targaryens used dragonglass 

to decorate their weapons 

without even knowing what 

the First Men used it for. 

What is it  

It s a map of Dragonstone. 

The Targaryens built their 

first stronghold there 

when they invaded Westeros. 

That s dragonglass  

A mountain of it. 

Beneath the ground. 

Stannis told me  but I didn t think... 

This is important. Jon needs to know. 

Has she come yet  

Who  

The Dragon Queen. 

Daenerys Stormborn. 

Haven t heard anything. 

Shall we begin  

Why you help us  

He takes us prisoner 

and now he s our friend  

You re not our 

prisoner  little lady. 

You re lucky we found you. 

These woods aren t safe 

for Ned Stark s daughter. 

Ride east. Your sister s 

waiting for you. 

Come on. 

Come on. 

I m waiting for word 

on an assignment 

that will take me far away 

from the capital. 

  I might be able to take you with me. 

  Watch out for her. 

Watch out for her with him. 

The Lord of Harrenhal will make a 

worthy suitor for the widow Arryn. 

  My lord.   You ll leave for the Eyrie 

as soon as possible. 

I m Jojen Reed. 

This is my sister Meera. 

We ve come a long way 

to find you  Brandon. 

And we have much farther to go. 

What have we here  

Frozen crows  

Bet you feed that pig 

better than you feed us. 

That pig s got value to me. 

What is it  

Yah  

Come  my lord. 

You re a long way from home 

and winter is coming. 

I want to buy them all. 

 . 

Master Kraznys says 

you cannot afford this. 

I have dragons. 

  They want the biggest one. 

  Done. 

I ll take you as well  now. 

You think you re 

the smartest man there is. 

And if you get in any trouble  

all you ve got to do 

is say  my father.  

You re nothing 

without your daddy. 

Never forget that. 

Here  this should 

help you remember. 

How many of those fingers 

do you think we could 

shove up his ass  

Depends if he s 

had any practice. 

Is that the sort of thing you and 

your sister go in for  Kingslayer  

She loosened you up for us  

He s going to fall. 

He s going to fall off his horse. 

Someone help him. 

Water. 

Water. 

Please  water. 

Wa water. 

Water  please. 

Please. Please. 

If I die  

you won t be getting   

Oh  enough. 

Here. 

Can t say that I ve ever seen a 

man drink horse piss that fast. 

Stop  

Far enough. 

Do that again 

and I ll take your other hand. 

Come on  you. 

Oh  Lord Tyrion. 

Come in  come in. 

I hope we might speak. 

In confidence. 

Oh  always in confidence. 

About the events 

of the Blackwater. 

Perhaps this is the wrong time  

Oh  no. 

It s a wonderful time. 

I thought one 

of your little birds 

might have knowledge of 

my sister s intentions to   

End your life  

I didn t inherit 

Littlefinger s spies 

along with his position  

I m afraid. 

Which is why I m coming to you. 

  I need proof. 

  Proof  

  Will there be a trial  

  I need to know. 

I have no proof  only whispers. 

Before all this nastiness  

I was going to tell you 

the story of how I was cut. 

Do you want to hear it still  

I don t know. 

Do I  

As a boy  I travelled 

with a troupe of actors 

through the Free Cities. 

One day in Myr  

a certain man 

made my master an offer 

too tempting to refuse. 

I feared the man meant 

to use me as I d heard 

some men used small boys. 

But what he wanted 

was far worse. 

He gave me a potion 

that made me powerless 

to move or speak  

yet did nothing 

to dull my senses. 

With a hooked blade 

he sliced me  

root and stem  

chanting all the while. 

He burned my parts 

in a brazier. 

The flames turned blue 

and I heard a voice 

answer his call. 

I still dream of that night. 

Not of the sorcerer  

not of his blade. 

I dream of the voice 

from the flames. 

Was it a god  

A demon  

A conjuror s trick  

I don t know. 

But the sorcerer called 

and a voice answered. 

And ever since that day  

I have hated magic and 

all those who practice it. 

But you can see 

why I was eager to aid 

in your fight against 

Stannis and his Red Priestess. 

A symbolic revenge of sorts. 

Yes  ahem. I feel the 

need for actual revenge 

against the actual person 

who tried to have me killed. 

Which will require a degree 

of influence  which   

You do not possess 

at the moment. 

But influence is largely 

a matter of patience  

I have found. 

Once I had served 

the sorcerer s purpose  

he threw me out 

of his house to die. 

I resolved to live 

to spite him. 

I begged. 

I sold what parts 

of my body remained to me. 

I became an excellent thief 

and soon learned that the 

contents of a man s letters 

are more valuable than the 

contents of his purse. 

Step by step  

one distasteful task 

after another  

I made my way 

from the slums of Myr 

to the small council chamber. 

Influence grows like a weed. 

I tended mine patiently 

until its tendrils 

reached from the Red Keep 

all the way across 

to the far side of the world 

where I managed to wrap 

them around something 

very special. 

The sorcerer. 

Hello  my old friend. 

It s been a long time. 

I have no doubt 

the revenge you want 

will be yours in time... 

if you have the stomach for it. 

When people talk about 

the Night s Watch  

they never mention 

the shoveling. 

Or the shit. 

They tell you about honor  

pardoning crimes  

and protecting the realm  

but shoveling 

really is most of it. 

And getting attacked 

or killed or worse. 

And that. But when you re not 

getting attacked or killed  

usually you re shoveling. 

Oh  look. 

More shit. 

I was starting 

to wonder what to do 

with the rest of my day. 

We need to get out of here. 

When the Lord Commander 

says we go  we go. 

The Lord Commander told us to go 

to the Fist of the First Men. 

  How d that turn out for us  

  He had no way of knowing. 

We do now. 

We know what s out there. 

Craster s been out here 

surviving. 

So he s your new protector now  

Our good friend Craster  

We re like the sons 

he never had. 

Mormont isn t 

gonna save you. 

This lummox here 

isn t gonna save you. 

When the walkers come calling  

Craster will serve us up 

like so many pigs. 

If we want to live... 

we ll have to look out 

for ourselves. 

Shh  shh  shh. 

  You woke him. 

  I m sorry. 

  He s beautiful. 

  Shh  

He s beautiful. 

Does he have a name  

  No. 

  Are you going to give him one  

Why  

Here. 

  Gilly.   You said to hold it for you 

until you came back. 

  You re back. 

  I wanted you to have it. 

I don t want 

your stupid thimble. 

I want to save 

my baby s life. 

Can you do that  

Can you  

I don t have time for you. 

I don t have time 

for anyone but him 

because he doesn t 

have much time. 

You have to go after him. 

How  

You know how. 

Brandon. 

  Mother. 

  How many times have I told you  

  No climbing. 

  Mother  I need to find it. 

  It s here. It s calling me. 

  I want you to promise me. 

No more climbing. 

Promise me. 

Promise me  

Promise me  

  Mother  Mother  

  Promise me  Promise me  Bran  

Promise me  

Is he very large  

No larger than usual  

apparently. 

  And yet they said that he was   

  Extraordinary. 

The most extraordinary man 

they ve ever had. 

And they ve had a lot of men. 

We re talking about 

the same Podrick  

The quiet boy 

in Lord Tyrion s service  

Seems a bit simple  

What did he do to them  

I don t know  my lord. 

The girls are usually 

quite descriptive. 

So what did they say  

They said it was hard 

to describe. 

Huh. 

Prodigies appear 

in the oddest of places. 

And what did Littlefinger say 

about this loss of income  

He was too preoccupied 

to notice. 

He s leaving 

for the Eyrie soon. 

I m helping him prepare 

for his journey. 

Ah  yes  to pursue 

his enduring love 

of the Lady Arryn and the 

title that comes with her. 

Sad  really. 

Is that all it takes 

to make our friend lose 

interest in poor Sansa Stark  

He hasn t spoken to her 

since the last time  

as far as I know. 

But I don t think 

he s lost interest. 

What makes you say so  

  His shipboard inventory. 

  Ah. 

You can read. 

Rare for a woman 

in your profession. 

  Former profession. 

  Of course. 

I m missing something obvious 

you re about to point out  

Two featherbeds. 

He s bringing two 

featherbeds for the cabin. 

Who is important enough 

to Littlefinger 

to merit a featherbed 

besides Littlefinger  

Could he be bringing 

one of his girls  

He s not interested 

in them  my lord. 

How do you know  

Because I m one of his girls. 

Prodigies in odd places indeed. 

Rhaenyra Targaryen 

was murdered by her brother  

or rather his dragon. 

It ate her 

while her son watched. 

What s left of her is buried in 

the crypts right down there. 

The ceremony is traditionally 

held in the main sanctum  

which seats  comfortably. 

There appears to be a 

good deal of room elsewhere 

on the premises 

for everyone else. 

There aren t more than  

people of any importance. 

No  the rest are there 

to look adoringly 

upon the  to remind them 

how superior they must be 

to have the best seats. 

Over there in that urn  

the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. 

Aerion Brightflame 

they called him. 

He thought drinking wildfire 

would turn him into a dragon. 

He was wrong. 

And  of course  

there s the Mad King  

killed by my uncle. 

Would you like to see where the 

last Targaryens are buried  

Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn t 

find all this a bit macabre  

Oh  no  it s quite 

all right  Your Grace. 

I d love to see 

their tombs  really. 

It s like taking a walk 

through history. 

  The tomb s just up here. 

  This is so exciting. 

You were married 

here  Your Grace  

  Yes. 

  Must seem like only yesterday. 

Seems like a lifetime ago. 

Your husband  was he 

buried here as well  

No  he wanted his remains 

returned to Storm s End. 

  Such a tragedy. 

  A fairly predictable tragedy. 

Hunting and drinking don t mix. 

I should say not. 

My son s a hunter. 

It helps him forget 

he s never been within 

a mile of a real battle. 

I seem to recall he laid 

siege to Storm s End 

for the better part of a year. 

All he laid siege to 

was the banquet table 

in the command tent. 

I told him to stay out 

of Robert s rebellion. 

He had no business 

fighting an actual warrior. 

We mothers do what we can 

to keep our sons 

from the grave. 

But they do seem 

to yearn for it. 

We shower them with good sense  

and it slides right off 

like rain off a wing. 

And yet the world 

belongs to them. 

A ridiculous 

arrangement  to my mind. 

The gods have seen fit 

to make it so. 

My father didn t 

want them here. 

He was going to have 

their bodies burned 

and thrown in the Blackwater  

but the High Septon 

convinced him otherwise. 

I m glad he did. 

I m sorry  Your Grace. 

I know they did terrible 

things at the end  

but their ancestors built this. 

Sometimes severity 

is the price we pay 

for greatness. 

I couldn t agree more. 

Shall we go and see them  

If you give them your love  

they will return it 

a thousandfold. 

I ve spoken with them. 

I know how they feel about you. 

You led the defense 

of King s Landing. 

They adore you. 

Open the doors. 

Joffrey. 

Wait. 

  Lady Margaery  

  Lady Margaery  

Bless you  Lady Margaery  

  Lady Margaery  

  Lady Margaery  

  Margaery  

  Long live Lady Margaery  

King Joffrey  

King Joffrey  

King Joffrey  

King Joffrey  

Gods bless King Joffrey  

How far is it 

to Deepwood Motte  

Not far  my lord. 

Your sister is waiting 

for you there. 

  She sent you to save me  

  Yes. 

I served them  the men 

who were torturing you. 

I did what they told me and 

waited for the right moment. 

Why would you risk 

your life for me  

I grew up on 

Saltcliffe  my lord. 

I was only a boy 

when they took you away. 

My father brought me and my 

brothers up to the bluffs 

so we could watch the ship 

that carried you off. 

I remember the look on my 

father s face when he told us  

 That s Balon Greyjoy s 

last living son.  

And those are the words 

I heard over and over again 

when I saw what 

they were doing to you. 

Those men  

they said my father knew 

what they were doing to me. 

Did he  

I   I don t know  

my lord. 

They   they never 

told me much. 

My sister s men 

are loyal to her. 

We don t need 

to hide from them. 

Not all those 

are your sister s men. 

Some of them are loyal 

to your father. 

What is it  

I was just thinking 

how jealous I was 

when my father told Yara 

to take this place. 

What did he tell you to do  

Raid fishing villages. 

He didn t trust me. 

Thought I was a Stark. 

Ha. I could never 

be a Stark. 

Robb Stark always 

reminded me of that. 

  He lorded it over you  

  Didn t have to. 

All he had to do was be. 

Be who he was born to be. 

His life fit him 

better than his clothes. 

How could someone like that 

ever be a brother to me  

He s the King in the North. 

And me... 

my father gave me a choice 

and I made it. 

I could never be a Stark. 

But ironborn  

that s what I was born to be. 

I paid the iron price 

for Winterfell. 

I murdered those boys. 

The Stark boys  

Never found them. 

Just some poor orphans 

living with a farmer. 

I let Dagmer slit their throats 

and I let him 

burn the bodies... 

so I could keep Winterfell... 

and make my father proud. 

Maybe it s not too late. 

It is. 

My real father lost his head 

at King s Landing. 

I made a choice... 

and I chose wrong. 

And now I ve burned 

everything down. 

Not everything  my lord. 

She s up here. 

  Yara. 

  Shh. 

Wait. 

I brought him back. 

He killed the others. 

What  

No  I didn t. 

You can t  

No  please stop  

No  

Put him back where he belongs. 

Eat. 

What are you doing  

I m dying. 

You can t die. 

You need to live 

to take revenge. 

I don t care about revenge. 

You coward. 

A little misfortune 

and you re giving up. 

Misfor   

misfortune  

You lost your hand. 

My sword hand. 

I was that hand. 

You have a taste   

one taste of the real world 

where people have important 

things taken from them 

and you whine and cry and quit. 

You sound like a bloody woman. 

I know what you did for me. 

You told them Tarth 

was full of sapphires. 

It s called the Sapphire Isle 

because of the blue 

of its water. 

You knew that. 

Why did you help me  

You wanted to speak to me  

Yes  about Jaime. 

What about him  

I wanted to make sure 

we re doing everything 

we can to get him back. 

When Catelyn Stark 

took Tyrion prisoner... 

what did I do in response  

  You started a war. 

  And if I would start a war 

for that lecherous 

little stump  

what do you think I am doing 

for my oldest son and heir  

Whatever you can. 

Whatever I can. 

  You re still here. 

  Yes. 

Why  

Did it ever occur to you 

that I might be the one 

who deserves your confidence 

and your trust  not your sons  

Not Jaime or Tyrion  but me. 

Years and years 

of lectures on family 

and legacy   

the same lecture  really  

just with tiny  

tedious variations   

did it ever occur to you 

that your daughter 

might be the only one listening to them  

Living by them  

That she might have the most 

to contribute to your legacy 

that you love so much more 

than your actual children  

All right. 

Contribute. 

The Tyrells are a problem. 

The Tyrells helped us 

defeat Stannis Baratheon. 

The Tyrells saved your life  

your children s lives. 

Margaery has her claws 

in Joffrey. 

She knows how 

to manipulate him. 

Good. 

I wish you knew 

how to manipulate him. 

I don t distrust you 

because you re a woman. 

I distrust you because you re not 

as smart as you think you are. 

You ve allowed that boy 

to ride roughshod over you 

and everyone else in this city. 

Perhaps... 

you should try stopping him 

from doing what he likes. 

I will. 

Do you like it  Nana  

Another golden rose. 

How original. 

I eat from plates 

stamped with roses. 

I sleep in sheets 

embroidered with roses. 

I have a golden rose 

painted on my chamber pot  

as if that makes it 

smell any better. 

Roses are boring  dear. 

 Growing strong.  

Ha  The dullest words 

of any house. 

 Winter is coming   

Now that s memorable. 

 We do not sow.  

Strong. Strong. 

Those are houses 

you watch out for. 

Direwolves and krakens  

fierce beasts. 

But a golden rose 

growing strong   

ha  that strikes fear 

in the heart. 

Look  little loves. 

A spider in the garden. 

Run along now. 

Grow strong. 

My lady. 

I wanted to personally 

welcome you to King s Landing. 

The city has been made 

brighter by your presence. 

The city is made brighter 

by my presence  

Is that your usual line  

Lord Varys  

Are you here to seduce me  

A little obvious  perhaps. 

Oh  no  please. 

Seduce away. 

It s been so long. 

Though I rather think 

it s all for naught. 

What happens when the nonexistent 

bumps against the decrepit  

A question for 

the philosophers. 

But you ve come mincing 

all this way for something. 

  So  

  Might I sit  

No. 

Come  I ve heard 

you re such a clever man. 

I m curious why 

you ve sought me out. 

You ve taken an interest 

in Sansa Stark. 

Have I  

Because I spoke to her 

once in this garden 

and one of your little spies 

came running to tell you  

Why shouldn t I take 

an interest  

  She s an interesting girl. 

  Is she  

No  not particularly. 

But she s had 

an interesting childhood. 

She has  sadly. 

Well  forgive me for wasting 

your time  then. 

I thought we shared certain 

hopes for her well being. 

Come  come. 

You surrender rather easily. 

Walk with me. 

I know the walls have ears  

but apparently 

the shrubbery does  too. 

I choose my allies carefully 

and my enemies 

more carefully still. 

Which is Sansa Stark  

Neither. 

A babe in the woods. 

  I admired her father. 

  Yes. 

Ned Stark had many admirers  

and how many stepped forward 

when the executioner 

came for his head  

I could not help Lord Stark. 

  Perhaps I can help his daughter. 

  How  

You re not the only one who 

has taken an interest in her. 

That s hardly surprising. 

She s a beautiful girl 

with a famous name. 

Indeed. She d make a lovely 

match for the right suitor. 

It almost feels as if you re 

about to arrive at the point. 

Littlefinger is not long 

for the capital. 

A confidant of mine has told me 

that when he goes  

Sansa Stark goes with him. 

And why have you come 

to me with this matter  

Littlefinger was born with no 

lands  no wealth  no armies. 

He has acquired the first two. 

How long before 

he has the army  

Perhaps you ll laugh  

but I know him better than most 

and this is the truth. 

Littlefinger is one of the most 

dangerous men in Westeros. 

If Robb Stark falls  

Sansa Stark is the key 

to the North. 

And if Littlefinger marries her  

he ll have the key in his pocket. 

Which seems such a shame. 

Why should a man 

with such a low reputation 

steal away such a lovely bride  

You must despise him. 

You re working so hard 

to undermine him. 

Actually  I rather enjoy him. 

But he would see 

this country burn 

if he could be 

king of the ashes. 

You are a clever man  

Lord Varys. 

You are too kind. 

I believe I have 

a possible solution. 

One doesn t need 

to be clever for that. 

It s all rather obvious  

isn t it  

Ahem. 

I didn t mean to disturb you. 

You haven t. 

We d like some privacy  please. 

If you wouldn t mind 

waiting back inside the keep. 

Or if you d be kind enough 

to give me your names  

I ll ask the king 

to speak with you himself. 

What did you pray for  

  I can t tell you. 

  Why not  

I ll tell you what I prayed 

for in the sept this morning. 

Let s see  for my family s 

health and happiness  

for an end to the war  

for a short winter. 

Boring and traditional  

I m afraid. 

  And you  

  I m sorry  I just can t. 

My cousin Alanna 

was the most beautiful 

girl I d ever seen. 

When I was   I was 

all elbows and knees 

and Alanna looked like a 

goddess sent to torture me. 

Pig face  she called me. 

Pig face  

That s ridiculous. 

I think it had something 

to do with my nose. 

Whenever she passed me 

in the halls  she d oink. 

So I prayed that she d catch 

a horrible skin disease. 

A week after that  she came 

down with porridge plague. 

  Porridge plague  

  You don t have it in the North  

Your skin starts 

to look like boiled oats 

and eventually your face slides 

off and you die in agony. 

But that s awful. 

You re   

I believed you  

Porridge plague. 

I m an idiot. 

Don t say that. 

No  you re not. 

So what happened to Alanna  

Oh  she grew up to be 

the most beautiful woman 

and married a handsome lord 

and they have darling children 

and live in a castle 

by the sea. 

It s all terribly frustrating. 

I m sure she s jealous 

of you now. 

You ll be married 

here in the capital 

and she ll have to come watch and 

pretend to be happy that you re queen. 

I want us to be friends  

good friends. 

That would make me very happy. 

You must see Highgarden. 

You d love it there. 

I know you would. 

We have a great masquerade the 

night of the harvest moon. 

You should see the costumes. 

People work on them for months. 

I   I don t think 

the queen 

would let me leave 

King s Landing. 

The Queen Regent  you mean. 

Once I marry Joffrey  

I ll be queen. 

And if you were 

to marry Loras... 

Oh  your place would be at 

Highgarden  wouldn t it  

We would be sisters  you and I. 

Would you like that  

His name was Bannen. 

He was a good man  

a good ranger. 

He came to us from   

where did he come from  

Down White Harbor way. 

He came to us 

from White Harbor. 

Never failed in his duty. 

He kept his vows 

the best he could. 

He rode far  fought fiercely. 

We shall never see 

his like again. 

And now his 

watch has ended. 

And now his watch has ended. 

Didn t think a broke foot 

could kill a man. 

It wasn t his foot 

that killed him. 

That bastard Craster 

starved him to death. 

Craster s got 

his daughters to feed. 

You on his side  

We can t just show up 

and steal all his food. 

We re brothers of the 

Night s Watch  not thieves. 

The day we leave  

Craster will tap 

a barrel of our wine 

and sit down to a feast 

of ham and potatoes 

and laugh at us 

starving in the snow. 

He s a bloody wildling 

is all he is. 

Never knew Bannen 

could smell so good. 

You have one son  

don t you  Mormont  

I had my . 

You ever meet a man 

with  sons  

And more daughters 

than I can count. 

  I m glad for you. 

  Are you now  

Me  I ll be glad when you 

and yours have gone. 

As soon as our wounded 

are strong enough. 

Ah. 

They re as strong 

as they re gonna get. 

Them that s dying  

why don t you cut their 

throats and be done with it  

Hmm  

Or leave them 

if you ve not the stomach 

and I ll sort them myself. 

Whose throat you 

gonna cut  old man  

Wait outside. 

It s cold outside and 

there s nothing to eat. 

My wives gave you bread. 

There s sawdust in the bread. 

You don t like it  

you go out there 

and eat the snow. 

I d rather eat what 

you ve got hidden away. 

I told you to wait outside. 

He s sitting there 

drinking our wine  

eating his fill while we die. 

I gave you crows enough. 

I ve got to feed my women  

So you admit you ve got 

a hidden larder  then  

How else d you make it 

through winter  

Enough  

Out  

I am a godly man. 

You re a stingy bastard  

Bastard  

Out with you  you little thief. 

And you  

And you  

Go sleep in the cold 

on empty bellies. 

I ll chop the hands 

off the next man 

who calls me bastard. 

You are a bastard. 

A daughter fucking  

wildling bastard. 

The gods will 

curse us for this. 

  By all the laws   

  There are no laws beyond the Wall. 

Now show us where 

he hides the food 

or you ll get 

the same as he did. 

Unhand her. 

I shall have your head for this. 

  Quickly. Quickly. 

  What s happening  

  I m not going out there. 

  No  we have to go. Now  

Follow me. 

I know the best way. 

Come on. 

Run fast  Piggy  

and sleep well  

I ll be cutting your throat 

one of these nights. 

Can I take 

this hood off yet  

I do apologize  little lady  

but it s better for you if you 

don t see where we re going. 

Whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa. 

Halt  

  What is it  

  Blackstrap rum. 

Ugh  

Not easy finding 

molasses in wartime. 

I d have some. 

Let s go home. 

What is this place  

Somewhere neither wolves 

nor lions come prowling. 

You look like 

a bunch of swineherds. 

Some of us 

were swineherds. 

And some of us tanners 

and masons. 

That was before. 

You re still swineherds 

and tanners and masons. 

You think carrying a crooked 

spear makes you a soldier  

No. 

Fighting in a war 

makes you a soldier. 

Beric Dondarrion  

You ve seen better days. 

And I won t see them again. 

Stark deserters. 

Baratheon deserters. 

You lot aren t 

fighting in a war. 

You re running from it. 

Last I heard  you were 

King Joffrey s guard dog. 

But here you are 

  miles from home. 

Which of us is running  

Untie these ropes 

and we ll find out. 

What are you doing 

leading a mob of peasants  

Ned Stark ordered me 

to execute your brother 

in King Robert s name. 

Ned Stark is dead. 

King Robert is dead. 

My brother s alive. 

You re fighting for ghosts. 

That s what we are   

ghosts waiting for you 

in the dark. 

You can t see us  

but we see you. 

No matter whose cloak 

you wear   

Lannister  Stark  

Baratheon   

you prey on the weak  

the Brotherhood without 

Banners will hunt you down. 

You found god  

Is that it  

Aye. 

I ve been reborn 

in the light 

of the one true god. 

As have we all. 

As would any man who s seen 

the things we ve seen. 

If you mean to murder me  then 

bloody well get on with it. 

You ll die soon enough  dog. 

But it won t be murder  

only justice. 

And a kinder 

fate than you deserve. 

Lions you call yourselves. 

At the Mummer s Ford  girls 

of seven years were raped 

and babes still on the breast 

were cut in two while 

their mothers watched. 

I wasn t at the Mummer s Ford. 

Dump your dead children 

at some other door. 

House Clegane was built 

upon dead children. 

I saw them lay Prince Aegon 

and Princess Rhaenys 

before the Iron Throne. 

Do you take me for my brother  

Is being born Clegane a crime  

  Murder is a crime. 

  I never touched the Targaryen babes. 

I never saw them  

never smelled them  

never heard them bawling. 

You want to cut my throat  

get on with it  

But don t call me murderer 

and pretend that you re not. 

You murdered Mycah. 

The butcher s boy. 

My friend. 

He was  years old. 

He was unarmed. 

And you rode him down. 

You slung him over your horse 

like he was some deer. 

Aye  he was a bleeder. 

You don t deny 

killing this boy  

I was Joffrey s sworn shield. 

  The boy attacked the prince. 

  That s a lie  

I hit Joffrey. 

Mycah just ran away. 

Then I should have killed you. 

Not my place 

to question princes. 

You stand accused of murder. 

But no one here knows 

the truth of the charge  

so it is not for us 

to judge you. 

Only the Lord of Light 

may do that now. 

I sentence you 

to trial by combat. 

So  who will it be  

Should we find out 

if your fire god 

really loves you  priest  

Or you  archer  What are you 

worth with a sword in your hand  

Or is the little girl 

the bravest one here  

Aye. 

She might be. 

But it s me you ll fight. 

The master says 

they are untested. 

He says you would be wise 

to blood them early. 

There are many small cities 

between here and there  

cities ripe for sacking. 

Should you take captives  

the masters will buy the healthy 

ones and for a good price. 

And who knows  

In  years  some of 

the boys you send them 

may be Unsullied in their turn. 

Thus all shall prosper. 

Is it done  then  

They belong to me  

It is done. 

You hold the whip. 

Dracarys. 

I made a deal for you 

to keep your ungrateful head 

on your ungrateful neck 

a little while longer. 

 i I m sorry   i  

 i what am I grateful for   i  

The opportunity to live 

and die at the Wall 

as punishment for a crime 

I did not commit  

You threw your life away. 

You threw it away. 

It s not a joke. 

You understand that  don t you  

Of course it s a joke  

just not a very funny one. 

I couldn t   

I couldn t listen to her 

standing there 

telling her lies. 

I couldn t do it. 

You fell in love 

with a whore. 

Yes  I fell in love 

with a whore. 

And I was stupid enough to think 

that she had fallen in love with me. 

That deal you made  

it was everything 

Father wanted. 

 i You do see that   i  

 i He gets you back  i  

 i as his heir.  i  

 i The future  i  

 i Lord of the Rock.  i  

And he ships me off 

to Castle Black  

out of sight at last. 

All so perfect. 

It felt good 

to take that from him. 

He knows I m innocent and he s 

willing to sacrifice me anyway. 

He s willing 

to sacrifice any of us. 

Not you. 

You re the golden son. 

You could kill a king  

lose a hand  

fuck your own sister  you ll 

always be the golden son. 

Careful. 

I m the last friend 

you ve got. 

At least I got to tell 

them what they really are. 

Yes  brilliant speech. 

They ll be talking 

about it for days to come. 

 i I thought you were  i  

 i a realist.  i  

Didn t realize 

you d die for pride. 

Don t give up on me 

just yet. 

I survived one 

trial by combat  

even though you weren t 

there to save me. 

I can t save you 

this time either. 

 i My training has proved  i  

that I can t beat a stable 

boy with my left hand. 

Where s your sense 

of adventure  

Even if you lose  

imagine the look 

on Father s face 

when you fall. 

Our family name snuffed out 

with a single swing 

of the sword. 

It is tempting. 

Well... 

Bronn fought for me once  

he ll do it again. 

If he wins  

I expect I ll be 

in his debt 

for the rest 

of my life. 

If he wins. 

Will you find him for me  

Who does Cersei plan 

on naming as a champion  

I hope it s Ser Meryn Trant. 

I d enjoy watching Bronn disembowel 

that pompous child beater. 

No. 

Not Ser Meryn. 

 i Go on  move it.  i  

And you. 

Come on. 

Mercy. 

Please. 

Please  mercy. 

Ser Gregor. 

Welcome to the capital. 

Thank you for riding 

here so quickly. 

You seem to be 

in good form. 

Who am I fighting  

Does it matter  

Could be food. 

Could be soldiers. 

You shouldn t be sitting 

out here like this. 

Where else to sit  

Tried to walk back 

to my hut  

hurt too much. 

Then I remembered 

they burned my hut down. 

Who were  they   

I stopped asking 

a while ago. 

That s not gonna 

get better. 

Doesn t seem so. 

A bad way to go. 

Haven t you had enough  

Of what  

I know. 

Time to go. 

Take matters into 

my own hands. 

The thought 

has occurred to me. 

So why go on  

Habit. 

Nothing could 

be worse than this. 

Maybe nothing is 

worse than this. 

Nothing isn t better 

or worse than anything. 

Nothing is just nothing. 

Who are you  

My name is Arya. 

Arya Stark. 

You her father  

Her captor. 

Bringing her to her aunt 

for ransom. 

A fair exchange  

that is. 

Always held to the notion 

of fair exchange 

in all my dealings. 

You give me  

I give you. 

 i Fair.  i  

A balance. 

No balance anymore. 

Could I have 

a drink  

Dying is thirsty work. 

Wish it were wine. 

So do I. 

That s where the heart is. 

That s how you kill a man. 

The fuck you doing  

 i There s a price  i  

 i on your head.  i  

Guess that s what the king does 

when you tell him to fuck off. 

The king s dead. 

 i He drank poisoned wine  i  

 i at his own wedding.  i  

The bounty on you is for 

killing Lannister soldiers. 

 silver stags. 

And you thought you 

were going to collect it  

 i Didn t think very hard   i  

 i did you   i  

You were Yoren s prisoners when 

he was taking me to the Wall. 

He told me he d fuck 

me bloody with a stick. 

This day s really not working 

out the way you planned. 

He on your little list  

He can t be. 

I don t know his name. 

What s your name  

  Rorge. 

  Thank you. 

You re learning. 

 i Rangers returning   i  

 i They return   i  

   i Rangers returning   i  

  Greetings. 

 i Didn t think I d see  i  

 i you again.  i  

All right  Jon  

Welcome back  brother. 

Lord Snow. 

 i This is no place  i  

 i for wild beasts.  i  

Lock him away 

or I ll let Hobb throw him 

in tonight s stew. 

Come on  Ghost. 

Mance s army was closing in 

on Craster s Keep when we left. 

We saw their campfires 

from Osric s Hill. 

They ll reach the Wall 

before the next full moon. 

I m surprised you didn t 

ride over and say hello. 

The King beyond the Wall 

is your old friend  isn t he  

We need to prepare. 

We ve been preparing. 

We should seal the tunnel. 

Plug it with rocks 

and ice. 

Flood it 

and let it freeze. 

 i And how would we  i  

 i range north   i  

  We wouldn t. 

 i   Coward.  i  

You would cut off 

our legs  

pluck out our eyes  

leave us cowering 

behind the Wall 

hoping for the storm 

to pass  

We can t defend the gate 

against   men. 

This castle has stood 

for thousands of years. 

The Night s Watch has defended 

her for thousands of years. 

And in all those centuries  we 

have never sealed the tunnel. 

Have you ever seen 

a giant  Ser Alliser  

 i I have.  i  

The tunnel s gate 

won t stop them. 

The bars on those gates 

are four inches thick. 

Cold rolled steel. 

They won t stop them. 

Remind me which order 

you belong to  Lord Snow. 

The stewards. 

Are the stewards responsible 

for maintaining the tunnel  

No. 

Who would that be  

  The builders. 

  Ah  the builders. 

First Builder Yarwyck  

Lord Snow here recommends 

sealing the tunnel  

leaving us unable 

to carry out our duties 

as sworn brothers 

of the Night s Watch. 

Do you agree with him  

No. 

 i Given your deep knowledge of  i  

 i the wildling army  Lord Snow   i  

you and Tarly will take 

night duties atop the Wall 

until the full moon. 

 i Moving on.  i  

 i First Builder  we ll need  barrels 

of pitch brought atop the wall.  i  

 i Aye.  i  

My lord. 

You have new clothes. 

Do you like  em  

Eh  

Gloves are doeskin. 

Softer than 

a virgin s thighs. 

 i I sent for you  i  

 i days ago.  i  

  I ve been a bit busy. 

  Doing what  

My lonesome 

bachelor days are over. 

I m to wed 

Lollys Stokeworth. 

Lollys Stokeworth  

 i She doesn t strike me  i  

 i as your sort of girl.  i  

I wouldn t say I had 

a single sort of girl. 

She s dim witted. 

If I wanted wits  

I d marry you. 

When my sister arranged 

this love match  

did she mention that Lollys 

has an older sister  

Falyse. 

Aye  I did know 

about the older sister. 

And you understand 

the rules of inheritance  

Falyse is  

and barren. 

 i She still gets Castle Stokeworth 

when her father dies.  i  

She does. 

Unless she happens 

to perish before her father. 

Then Lollys gets the castle. 

What  Ladies fall 

from their horses 

and snap their pretty 

necks all the time. 

You and my sister 

deserve each other. 

 i Why did you bother  i  

 i to come here   i  

You once said if anyone ever 

asked me to sell you out  

you d double their price. 

Is it two wives you want 

or two castles  

One of each will do. 

But if you want me to kill 

the Mountain for you  

it d better be 

a damn big castle. 

I m a bit short 

on castles at the moment. 

But I can offer you 

gold and gratitude. 

I have gold. 

What can I buy 

with gratitude  

You might be surprised. 

A Lannister always 

pays his debts. 

Your sister s 

a Lannister  too. 

My wife is heir 

to Winterfell. 

 i If I emerge from this with my 

head still on my shoulders   i  

 i I may one day rule  i  

 i the North in her name.  i  

I could carve you out 

a big piece of it. 

If and may and could. 

It s bloody 

cold up north. 

Lollys is soft and warm. 

And close. 

If I gave you the choice 

between fucking Lollys 

and fighting the Mountain  

you d have your britches down 

and your cock out 

before I could blink. 

Does he frighten 

you so much  

I d be a bloody fool 

if he didn t frighten me. 

He s freakish big 

and freakish strong. 

And quicker than you d expect 

for a man of that size. 

Maybe I could take him  

dance around 

until he s so tired 

of hacking at me  

he dropped his sword  

get him off 

his feet somehow. 

But one misstep... 

...and I m dead. 

Why should I risk it  

Because you re my friend. 

Aye  I m your friend. 

And when have you ever 

risked your life for me  

I like you  

pampered little shit 

that you are. 

I just like myself more. 

I understand. 

I m sorry it has 

to be this way. 

Why are you sorry  

Because you re 

an evil bastard 

with no conscience 

and no heart  

 i That s what I liked about  i  

 i you in the first place.  i  

We had some 

good days together. 

Yes  we did. 

What will you do  

I suppose I ll have to kill 

the Mountain myself. 

Won t that make 

for a great song  

I hope to hear 

them sing it one day. 

How did you get in here  

Your door is well guarded  

but your window is not. 

I swam to an island 

a mile offshore for these. 

Don t do that again. 

Never met a woman who 

didn t like wildflowers. 

These are my 

private quarters. 

If I want you here  

I will summon you. 

Forgive me  my queen. 

I live to serve you. 

 i Tell me why you re here.  i  

I came to ask a favor. 

I only have two talents 

in this world   

war and women. 

 i You are staying here  i  

 i in Meereen to rule.  i  

 i That is a wise decision.  i  

 i I respect it.  i  

But here in Meereen  

I cannot pursue my talents. 

I ve ordered the Second Sons 

to patrol the streets 

to stop 

the revenge killing. 

You ve ordered us 

to be night watchmen. 

And as for women  

there are thousands 

in Meereen you can pursue. 

There is only one  

and she does not 

want me. 

You swore me your sword. 

My sword is yours 

till the day I die. 

So if I command you 

to stay in Meereen 

and patrol the streets  

I ll stay in Meereen 

and patrol the streets. 

Send me to kill 

your enemies. 

Any enemy anywhere. 

Let me do 

what I do best. 

Very well. 

Do what you do best. 

Take off your clothes. 

Oh. 

Come in  my queen. 

Please. 

I didn t mean 

to disturb you  my lady. 

You could never 

disturb me. 

I just wanted to speak 

with you before we left. 

Could you bring me 

that vial over there  

The blue one. 

 i No  no  no.  i  

 i Not that one.  i  

You don t even want 

to touch that one. 

 i Next to it.  i  

 i That s the one.  i  

When I looked into 

the flames this morning  

the Lord spoke to me. 

He said  

 Tonight  you will have your 

last good bath in a long while. 

Make it count.  

A joke. 

Not a very good one  

I m afraid. 

It was. I   

humor isn t my strength. 

That s because 

most jokes are lies 

and you re devoted 

to the truth. 

If they re lies  my lady  

aren t they best avoided  

Not always. 

Most of these powders 

and potions 

are lies. 

 i Deceptions to make men think 

they witnessed our Lord s power.  i  

Once they step into his light  they 

will see the lie for what it was   

a trick that led them 

to the truth. 

 i A pinch of this powder  i  

 i in a bonfire  i  

will send a flaming column 

screaming towards the sky. 

And this one creates 

a black smoke 

that will make the bravest 

man piss himself with fear. 

And a drop of this 

in any man s wine 

will drive him 

wild with lust. 

Did you use it 

with Stannis  

No. 

Don t be upset. 

Men never crave 

what they already have. 

It s only flesh. 

It needs 

what it needs. 

No act done in service 

of the Lord 

can ever be called a sin. 

I thank God every day 

for bringing you to us. 

And Stannis to you. 

He wants to bring 

Shireen with us. 

I think that would be 

ill advised. 

 i My daughter has heretical 

tendencies  as you re well aware.  i  

I don t know if her doubt is real 

or simply meant to spite me  

but whichever the case  

she should stay home. 

I understand 

how you feel. 

Hmm. 

But that 

is impossible. 

Why  

You don t need powders 

and potions  my queen. 

You don t need lies. 

You are strong enough to 

look into the Lord s light 

and see his truth 

for yourself. 

However harsh it is. 

However hard for us 

to understand. 

 i You don t need my help   i  

 i but I will need yours soon.  i  

When we set sail  your 

daughter must be with us. 

The Lord needs her. 

Jorah the Andal. 

Are you here 

to see our queen  

She s in a good mood. 

Khaleesi. 

  You re here early. 

  Later than some. 

You don t approve  

It s not a question of approval  

it s a question of trust. 

You neither 

approve nor trust. 

Why would I  

The man s a sellsword. 

Didn t you fight for 

the Golden Company 

before pledging 

your sword to my brother  

I did. 

I trust you. 

Daario Naharis 

killed his captains 

and dumped their heads at your feet 

when he grew tired of their commands. 

How could you ever have 

faith in a man like that  

I could never have faith 

in a man like Daario. 

That s why I ve sent him and the 

Second Sons to retake Yunkai. 

  You have  

  I have. 

Without you there 

to rule  Khaleesi  

I fear the masters 

will simply bide their time  

wait for the invaders 

to leave and reassert control. 

That is why I ve ordered Daario to 

execute every master in Yunkai. 

The masters tear babies 

from their mothers  arms. 

They mutilate little boys 

by the thousands. 

They train little girls in the 

art of pleasuring old men. 

They treat men like beasts  

as you said yourself. 

Herding the masters into pens and 

slaughtering them by the thousands 

is also treating men 

like beasts. 

The slaves you freed  

brutality is all 

they ve ever known. 

If you want them to know 

something else  

you ll have 

to show it to them. 

And repay the slavers 

with what  Kindness  

A fine  

A stern warning  

It s tempting to see your 

enemies as evil  all of them  

but there s good and evil on both 

sides in every war ever fought. 

Let the priests argue 

over good and evil. 

Slavery is real. 

I can end it. 

I will end it. 

 i And I will end  i  

 i those behind it.  i  

I sold men 

into slavery  Khaleesi. 

And now you are helping me 

show them to freedom. 

I wouldn t be here to help you 

if Ned Stark had done to me 

what you want to do 

to the masters of Yunkai. 

The man who came to me the other 

day about burying his father. 

Hizdahr zo Loraq  

He will accompany 

the Second Sons 

and serve as my 

ambassador to Yunkai. 

He will tell the masters 

what has happened in Meereen. 

He will explain the choice 

they have before them. 

They can live 

in my new world 

or they can die 

in their old one. 

Well  go and catch Daario 

before he leaves. 

Tell him 

I changed my mind. 

Yes  Khaleesi. 

No. 

Tell him i  you  i  

changed my mind. 

Rat cunts. 

Fucking whore. 

 i You re doing it wrong.  i  

You need to burn away 

that horrible bit there. 

 i Otherwise it s gonna  i  

 i get infected and fester.  i  

I know you don t like fire  

but if you don t do it right   

No fire. 

It ll only take a second. 

  It won t hurt that much. 

  No fire  

Shut up about it. 

Shut up about everything. 

Thanks to you  

I m a walking bag of silver 

anywhere the Lannisters 

hold sway. 

Which is everywhere 

between where we are now 

and where we re going. 

I m as stupid as that hog 

you stuck back in the village  

getting myself cut 

and stabbed and bitten. 

No reward is worth 

this much trouble. 

 i Wish I d never  i  

 i laid eyes on you.  i  

You say your brother 

gave you that sword. 

My brother gave me this. 

It was just like you said 

a while back. 

 i Pressed me to the fire  i  

like I was a nice 

juicy mutton chop. 

Why  

Thought I stole 

one of his toys. 

I didn t steal it. I was 

just playing with it. 

The pain was bad. 

The smell was worse. 

But the worst thing was that 

it was my brother who did it. 

My father  

who protected him... 

told everyone my bedding 

caught fire. 

You think 

you re on your own  

Let me wash it out 

and help you 

sew it up at least. 

Bit of comfort 

never hurt anyone. 

We ve been sleeping in 

ditches the last few weeks. 

I think we can treat ourselves 

to a featherbed for the night 

and a hot meal 

not cooked by you. 

Couldn t agree 

more  my lady. 

Just don t start expecting 

silk underclothes. 

Not working for your 

former lord any longer. 

  Yes  my lady. 

  Don t get drunk. 

No  my lady. 

 i Can I get you  i  

 i anything else   i  

No  this will do 

nicely  thank you. 

Kidney pie is wonderful. 

Thanks. 

I do my best. 

A good kidney pie is all 

about the ingredients. 

 i Flour  lard  water   i  

 i eggs  milk.  i  

Easy enough. 

But the meat  

peacetime or not  getting your 

hands on a good bottom round steak 

and calves  kidneys 

is not easy. 

I mean  some people settle 

for plain old beef kidneys. 

Got no right to cook 

anything  them. 

Oh  and the gravy. 

Don t get me started 

on the gravy. 

 i Very difficult  i  

 i to get right.  i  

 i See  a lot of people  i  

 i give up on the gravy.  i  

You cannot give up 

on the gravy. 

No gravy  no pie. 

Simple as that. 

That s nice armor. 

Are you a knight  

No. 

Oh  it s just people with 

armor are usually knights. 

 i Generally speaking. From King s 

Landing  though  aren t you   i  

 i From there myself originally.  i  

 i Flea Bottom born and bred.  i  

 i What brings you  i  

 i to these parts   i  

We re looking 

for someone. 

Someone in particular  

Maybe they came in here. 

A lot of people come in here. 

Just the other day we had    

A girl  tall  red hair  

very pretty. 

Her name is Sansa Stark  but she 

may be using a different name. 

Starks  

What  like them lot 

from  Winterhell   

No  ain t seen 

anyone like that. 

I heard they was 

all traitors. 

Don t need 

no traitors in here. 

 i I pledged my life to  i  

 i their mother Catelyn Stark.  i  

I swore to her I d bring 

her daughters home. 

Sure I can t get you 

a bit more kidney pie  

What  

It s nothing  my lady. 

You wouldn t be screwing your face 

up like that if it was nothing. 

Don t want to offend  my lady. 

Truly  I don t. 

You re not interesting 

enough to be offensive. 

The Lannisters 

want Lady Sansa. 

The Lannisters 

have money. 

People kill for money. 

I don t think we should 

be telling people 

we re searching 

for Lady Sansa. 

My lady. My lord. 

Could I have a word  

What about  

Not kidney pie. 

 i You seem  i  

 i like a proper lady.  i  

 i Someone who could  i  

 i be trusted.  i  

I never met no Sansa Stark. 

But I know her sister... 

Arya. 

No one s seen Arya Stark since 

her father was beheaded. 

She s presumed dead. 

She weren t when I last 

spoke to her. 

  When was that    i  Heading up 

north with the Night s Watch.  i  

She was all dressed up 

as a boy. 

Like your ladyship  

only without the armor. 

 i Going by the name Arry.  i  

  So what happened to her  

  Well   

The quick version. 

The Lannisters 

took us prisoner. 

We escaped. 

The Brotherhood took 

us prisoner. 

They sold me 

to the innkeep. 

 i They were gonna sell Arya  i  

 i to her mother at Riverrun  i  

 i along with another prisoner.  i  

Big ugly fellow. 

Foul mouth 

and a face like 

a half burnt ham. 

   i Not friendly.  i  

  The Hound. 

That s the one. 

If you find her  

could you give her this  

She liked the last one 

I gave her  

but  well  this one 

turned out better. 

Um  you were saying  

 i Her mother s dead   i  

 i grandfather s dead   i  

Walder Frey is 

the new lord of Riverrun. 

The Brotherhood 

isn t going to Riverrun. 

They ll take her 

to the Eyrie  my lady. 

Why the Eyrie  

Her aunt  Lysa Arryn. 

Catelyn Stark s sister. 

She s Arya s last living 

relative with money. 

She hates the Lannisters. 

Lord Tyrion 

made sure I knew 

which house married which 

and who hated who. 

Sansa could 

be there  too. 

Aye  my lady. 

Could be. 

You sure about this  

No. 

I imagined you d be back 

at the brothel at this hour. 

I did spend some time with an absolutely 

stunning blonde the other day. 

Mm  do tell. 

I ve got every kind 

of filth down here 

except the kind I like. 

Your sister. 

Oh. 

Cersei approached me. 

 i We spoke a great deal  i  

 i about her daughter.  i  

How worried your sister 

is about her. 

 i She was trying  i  

 i very hard to pretend  i  

 i she had not come  i  

 i to sway me against you.  i  

 i I think she may have even  i  

 i believed it herself.  i  

Making honest feelings 

do dishonest work 

is one of her many gifts. 

It was difficult for her 

to hide her true intentions. 

It is rare 

to meet a Lannister 

who shares my enthusiasm 

for dead Lannisters. 

She desperately wants 

to see you killed. 

She didn t need 

to bother you. 

It looks as though I ve 

taken care of that myself. 

 i The joy she will feel  i  

 i when my head  i  

 i leaves my neck.  i  

She s wanted this 

for a long time. 

Yes  I know. 

 i We met  you and I.  i  

Many years ago. 

I think I would 

have remembered that. 

Unlikely. 

You had just been born. 

Our father brought me 

and my sister Elia with him 

on a visit 

to Casterly Rock. 

 i My first time  i  

 i away from Dorne.  i  

I didn t like anything 

about the Rock. 

Not the food  

not the weather  

not your accents. 

Nothing. 

But the biggest 

disappointment... 

you. 

You and my family have more in 

common than you might admit. 

 i The whole way from Dorne  i  

all anyone talked about 

was the monster 

that had been born 

to Tywin Lannister. 

 i A head twice  i  

 i the size of his body   i  

 i a tail between his legs   i  

claws  one red eye  

the privates of both 

a girl and a boy. 

That would have made 

things so much easier. 

 i When we met your sister  she 

promised she would show you to us.  i  

Every day we would ask. 

Every day she would 

say   Soon.  

Then she and your brother 

took us 

to your nursery and... 

she unveiled the freak. 

 i Your head  i  

 i was a bit large.  i  

 i Your arms and legs  i  

 i were a bit small   i  

but no claw. 

No red eye. 

No tail between your legs. 

Just a tiny pink cock. 

 i We didn t try to hide  i  

 i our disappointment.  i  

 i  That s not a monster    i  

 i I told Cersei.  i  

 That s just a baby.  

 i And she said   i  

 i  He killed my mother.   i  

 i And she pinched  i  

 i your little cock so hard   i  

 i I thought she might  i  

 i pull it off.  i  

 i Until your brother  i  

 i made her stop.  i  

 i  It doesn t matter    i  

 i she told us.  i  

 i  Everyone says  i  

 i he will die soon.  i  

 i I hope they are right.  i  

 i He should not  i  

 i have lived this long.   i  

Well... 

sooner or later  Cersei 

always gets what she wants. 

And what about 

what I want  

Justice 

for my sister 

and her children. 

If you want justice  

you ve come 

to the wrong place. 

I disagree. 

I ve come to 

the perfect place. 

I want to bring those who 

have wronged me to justice. 

And all those who have 

wronged me are right here. 

I will begin with 

Ser Gregor Clegane  

 i who killed  i  

 i my sister s children  i  

and then raped her with their 

blood still on his hands 

before killing her  too. 

I will be your champion. 

Hello  Robin. 

What are you doing  

I m building my home  

Winterfell. 

At least I think I am. 

I haven t been back there 

in a very long time. 

Why did you leave  

It s a long story. 

I stay here in the Eyrie. 

Mother says it s dangerous on the 

roads and I have to keep myself safe 

because I m the Lord 

of the Vale 

and the Lord of the Vale 

is a very important person. 

Yes  you certainly are. 

When will you go back  

Probably never. 

My family doesn t 

live there anymore 

and someone 

burned it down. 

Oh. 

Does Winterfell 

have a Moon Door  

No  I m afraid not. 

It s not high up in the mountains. 

It s down on the ground. 

That sounds dangerous. 

  How do you make people fly  

  We don t. 

What do you do with 

all the bad people 

and the scary people 

and the people you don t like  

I never did anything 

with them at all. 

Girls didn t take part 

in that where I came from. 

Well  I m Lord 

of the Vale. 

When I grow up  I ll be able 

to fly anybody who bothers me. 

Or you. 

When we get married  

you can tell me 

if you don t like somebody 

and then we can bring them 

back here and  whoosh  

Right through 

the Moon Door. 

I like the sound of that. 

Let s put a Moon Door 

in your Winterfell. 

All right. 

It can go in here 

in this big tower. 

Careful. 

You ve ruined it. 

Now I m going to have 

to rebuild the whole thing. 

  I didn t ruin it. 

  You did. 

It was already ruined because 

it didn t have a Moon Door. 

I was fixing it. 

Knocking things down 

isn t fixing them. 

  It s ruining them. 

  I didn t ruin it  

  You re being stupid. 

  I didn t ruin it  

Robin  I m sorry  I   

 i Children.  i  

   i I hit him.  i  

  Yes  I saw. 

I shouldn t have done that. 

No  his mother 

should have 

a long time ago. 

Consider it a step 

in the right direction. 

If he tells Aunt Lysa... 

Let me worry about 

Aunt Lysa. 

I was trying to remember 

what everything looked like. 

I ll never see it again. 

A lot can happen 

between now and never. 

If you want to build 

a better home  

first you must 

demolish the old one. 

Why did you really 

kill Joffrey  

Tell me why. 

I loved your mother more 

than you could ever know. 

Given the opportunity  

what do we do to those 

who ve hurt 

the ones we love  

In a better world  

one where love 

could overcome 

strength and duty  

you might have been 

my child. 

But we don t live 

in that world. 

You re more beautiful 

than she ever was. 

Lord Baelish... 

Call me Petyr. 

 i You wanted  i  

 i to see me  Aunt Lysa   i  

Come here  Sansa. 

Do you know how far 

the fall is  

No. 

 i Neither do I  precisely.  i  

 i Hundreds of feet.  i  

It s fascinating 

what happens to bodies when they 

hit the rocks from such a height. 

The impact breaks them 

right apart. 

Like eggs dropped 

on the floor. 

Sometimes pieces 

remain intact. 

You ll find the head 

sitting on its own. 

Every hair in place. 

Blue eyes staring 

at nothing. 

I know what you did. 

I m so sorry  Aunt Lysa. 

I never should have hit Robin  I know it. 

I promise it won t happen   

Don t be coy with me  

you little whore. 

You kissed him. 

You kissed Petyr. 

  I didn t. You don t understand. 

  I saw you. 

You can t lie to me because 

I saw it with my own eyes. 

  He kissed me. I pulled away. 

  Liar  

Whore  He is mine  

My father  my husband  

my sister  

they all stood between us 

and now they re all dead. 

That s what happens to people 

who stand between Petyr and me. 

Look down  

Look down  

Look down  Look down  

 i Lysa   i  

Let her go. 

You want her  

This empty headed child  

Let her go. 

She s just like her mother. 

She ll never love you. 

I lied for you. 

 i I killed for you.  i  

Why did you bring 

her here  Why  

I ll send her away. 

I swear on my life. 

I swear to all the gods. 

Let her go  Lysa. 

Oh  my sweet wife. 

My sweet  silly wife. 

I have only loved 

one woman... 

only one  

my entire life. 

Your sister. 

 i Your Grace.  i  

The trial will be 

getting under way soon. 

You got my money  

Later. 

Go away. 

Grand Maester. 

Ser Loras Tyrell. 

Are you prepared to stand trial 

and profess your guilt or 

innocence before the Seven  

There ll be no need for a trial. 

I confess before the Seven 

and freely admit to my crimes. 

To which crimes 

will you be confessing  

All of them. 

I lay with other men 

including the traitor 

Renly Baratheon. 

 i I perjured myself before the gods.  i  

I am guilty of depravity... 

dishonesty  

profligacy  

 i and arrogance.  i  

I see that now. 

I humble myself before the Seven 

and accept whatever punishment 

the gods deem just. 

The gods  judgment is fierce  

but also fair. 

The Warrior punishes those 

who believe themselves 

beyond the reach of justice. 

But the Mother shows her mercy 

to those who kneel before her. 

 i I take full 

responsibility for my many sins  i  

and unburden myself of my desires. 

My only remaining wish 

is to devote my life to the Seven. 

 i May I be a living example 

of their grace  i  

 i for others to witness.  i  

You understand fully 

what this means  

I do. 

I will abandon the Tyrell name 

and all that goes with it. 

I will renounce my lordship 

and my claims on Highgarden. 

I will never marry 

and I will never father children. 

 i Brother Loras...  i  

...I ask you to dedicate 

your life to the seven gods. 

Will you fight to defend your faith 

against heretics and apostates  

I will. 

No  I can t let them   

Faith is the way  Father. 

All right. 

I m ready. 

I have to go. 

I m   

I m late for the trial. 

 i You mutilated him.  i  

You gave me your word. 

And I have kept my word. 

 i Once the queen mother s 

trial is concluded   i  

 i Brother Loras is free to leave.  i  

And where is the queen mother  

Her litter never left the Red Keep. 

It appears the queen mother doesn t 

wish to attend her own trial. 

Go to the Red Keep 

and show her the way. 

Get the others. 

Where s the king  

Elsewhere  I m afraid. 

What s the meaning of this  

I was told that   

ah. 

I have more important 

things to do with my time 

than waste them 

in the presence   

Please  Grand Maester. 

I bear you no ill will. 

Please forgive me if you can. 

This pains me  my lord. 

Whatever your faults  

you do not deserve 

to die alone in such 

a cold  dark place. 

But sometimes before 

we can usher in the new  

the old must be put to rest. 

The longer you wait  

the worse it ll be for you. 

What are you doing  

There s something wrong. 

You have nothing to fear  Your Grace. 

The trial will begin shortly. 

Cersei is not here. 

Tommen is not here. 

Why do you think they re not here  

If the accused is not here  

she will be tried regardless. 

We cannot escape 

the justice of the gods   

Forget about the bloody gods and 

listen to what I m telling you. 

Cersei understands the 

consequences of her absence 

and she is absent anyway  

which means she does not intend 

to suffer those consequences. 

The trial can wait. 

We all need to leave. 

We all need to leave now. 

Loras. 

Stay with me. 

Let me through. 

Let me through. 

 i Get out of my way.  i  

Let us through. 

 i Confess.  i  

 i Confess.  i  

  No. 

  Confess. 

Confess. 

It felt good. 

Beating me  starving me  

frightening me  humiliating me. 

 i You didn t do it because 

you cared about my atonement.  i  

You did it because it felt good. 

 i I understand.  i  

I do things because they feel good. 

I drink because it feels good. 

I killed my husband because it 

felt good to be rid of him. 

I fuck my brother because it feels 

good to feel him inside me. 

I lie about fucking my brother... 

because it feels good to keep our 

son safe from hateful hypocrites. 

I killed your High Sparrow... 

 i and all his little sparrows...  i  

all his septons  all his septas  

all his filthy soldiers  

because it felt good 

to watch them burn. 

It felt good to imagine 

their shock and their pain. 

No thought has ever 

given me greater joy. 

Even confessing feels good 

under the right circumstances. 

You ve always been quiet. 

I said my face would be the last 

thing you saw before you died. 

Do you remember  

Good. 

I m glad to see your face. 

I m ready to meet the gods. 

What  

Now  

Today  

You re not going to die today. 

You re not going to die 

for quite a while. 

Ser Gregor. 

 i This is Ser Gregor Clegane.  i  

He s quiet  too. 

Your gods have forsaken you. 

This is your god now. 

No. 

No. 

Shame. 

Shame. 

Shame. 

 i I m very sorry  Your Grace.  i  

Very sorry. 

 i For House Lannister   i  

 i Hear me roar   i  

For House Frey  

We stand together  

May we stand together 

through the centuries  

good friends to the last. 

And when we drive our swords 

through our enemies  hearts  

may we speak the words 

of our alliance  

 The Freys and the Lannisters 

send their regards.  

You don t even have 

to do anything  do you  

You just sit there  

a rich slab of beef  

and all the birds come pecking. 

  You re welcome to her. 

  She doesn t want me. 

She wants your golden 

fingers up her twat. 

Those two have their eyes on you. 

They have their eyes on you  cunt. 

Not my type. 

Not blonde enough  

Ladies  have you met 

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater  

hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay  

  There you go. 

  Maybe I m not in the mood. 

Fuck it. 

No need to call me ser just 

because I m an anointed knight. 

This came together rather well. 

Your father would be pleased. 

I m sure he would be. 

Edmure is back in a cell. 

Can t go killing my son by law. 

It wouldn t be right. 

Give the family a bad name. 

So the famous Blackfish 

killed by foot soldiers  eh  

Legendary warrior  everyone said. 

Have you done much fighting 

yourself  Lord Frey  

I m a bit old for all that. 

No  but back in your day. 

The purpose of fighting 

is defeating your enemies  isn t it  

I ve defeated mine. 

Riverrun belonged to House 

Tully for a thousand years. 

Now it s mine. 

What do you call that  

Victory. 

Yes  you re a great conqueror. 

Go on  mock me  boy. 

You think I mind  

The Tullys mocked me for years. 

The Starks mocked me. 

Where are they now  

 i You talk about war 

as if you re an expert   i  

but the one battle 

I remember you fighting  

you were captured by Robb 

Stark  the Young Wolf. 

 i But it doesn t matter.  i  

Here we are now  two kingslayers. 

We know what it s like to 

have them grovel to our faces 

and snigger behind our backs. 

We don t mind  do we  

Fear is a marvelous thing. 

They don t fear the Freys  though. 

They fear the Lannisters. 

We gave you the Riverlands 

to hold the Riverlands. 

If we have to ride north 

and take them back for you 

every time you lose them  

why do we need you  

Show me. 

Your Grace  

there s no need   

Show me. 

What are your thoughts 

concerning the king s funeral  

As the Sept of Baelor 

is no longer an option  

 i perhaps a ceremony 

in the throne room   i  

He should be with his grandfather  

his brother  his sister. 

Burn him 

and bury his ashes 

where the sept once stood. 

Whoa  whoa. 

Hello. 

From Lord Commander Snow 

at Castle Black. 

I m   

I m to be the new maester. 

Oh. 

According to our records  

Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander. 

He died. 

We received no report from 

the maester at Castle Black. 

Maester Aemon became quite ill 

shortly after the election. 

He s since passed away. 

Which is why I m here. 

This is irregular. 

Yes  well  I suppose 

that life is irregular. 

The archmaester will discuss 

these irregularities with you. 

In the meantime  you are 

permitted to use the library. 

Follow me. 

No women or children. 

When we had feasts  

our family would sit up here... 

and I d sit down there. 

Could have been worse  Jon Snow. 

You had a family. 

You had feasts. 

Aye  you re right. 

I was luckier than most. 

What is that  

Tell him. 

 i Tell him who it belonged to.  i  

The Princess Shireen. 

Tell him what you did to her. 

Tell him  

We burned her at the stake. 

Why  

The army was trapped. 

The horses were dying. 

  It was the only way. 

  You burned a little girl alive  

I only do what my Lord commands. 

If he commands you to burn 

children  your Lord is evil. 

We are standing here because of him. 

 i Jon Snow is alive 

because the Lord willed it.  i  

I loved that girl 

like she was my own. 

She was good. She was kind. 

And you killed her  

So did her father. 

So did her mother. 

 i Her own blood knew 

it was the only way.  i  

The only way for what  

They all died anyway. 

You told everyone 

Stannis was the one. 

You had him believing it  

all of them fooled. 

  And you lied. 

  I didn t lie. 

I was wrong. 

 i Aye  you were wrong.  i  

How many died because you were wrong  

I ask your leave to execute 

this woman for murder. 

 i She admits to the crime.  i  

Do you have anything 

to say for yourself  

I ve been ready 

to die for many years. 

If the Lord was done with 

me  so be it  but he s not. 

You ve seen the Night King  Jon Snow. 

You know the great war 

is still to come. 

You know the army of the 

dead will be upon us soon. 

And you know I can 

help you win that war. 

Ride south today. 

If you return to the North  

I ll have you hanged as a murderer. 

If you ever come back this way  

I will execute you myself. 

I m having the lord s 

chamber prepared for you. 

Mother and Father s room  

You should take it. 

I m not a Stark. 

You are to me. 

You re the Lady of Winterfell. 

You deserve it. We re 

standing here because of you. 

 i The battle was lost until the 

Knights of the Vale rode in.  i  

They came because of you. 

You told me Lord Baelish 

sold you to the Boltons. 

  He did. 

  And you trust him  

Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. 

I should have told you about him  

about the Knights of the Vale. 

I m sorry. 

We need to trust each other. 

We can t fight a war 

amongst ourselves. 

We have so many enemies now. 

Jon. 

A raven came from the Citadel. 

A white raven. 

Winter is here. 

Well  Father always 

promised  didn t he  

The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne  

he was assassinated. 

 red scorpions  was it  

You have nothing to fear 

from us  Lady Olenna. 

You murder your own prince  

but you expect me to trust you  

We invited you to Dorne 

because we needed your help. 

You came to Dorne because 

you needed our help. 

What is your name again  

Barbaro  

Obara. 

Obara. You look like 

an angry little boy. 

 i Don t presume to tell me what I need.  i  

Forgive my sister. What she 

lacks in diplomacy  she makes   

Do shut up  dear. 

Anything from you  

No  Good. 

Let the grown women speak. 

The Lannisters have declared 

war on House Tyrell. 

They have declared war on Dorne. 

We must be allies now 

if we wish to survive. 

Cersei stole the future from me. 

She killed my son. 

 i She killed my grandson.  i  

She killed my granddaughter. 

Survival is not what I m after now. 

You re absolutely right. 

I chose the wrong words. 

It is not survival I offer. 

It is your heart s desire. 

And what is my heart s desire  

Vengeance. 

Justice. 

Fire and blood. 

Your ships are nearly ready. 

I saw them painting the sails. 

I m curious to see how the 

Dothraki do on the poison water. 

You re not coming with us. 

New strategy  

You want the Second Sons to 

attack from the west coast  

If we take Casterly Rock  

the Lannisters will have nowhere to 

run when you hit King s Landing. 

You re not going to Westeros. 

You re staying here 

with the Second Sons. 

There s finally peace in Meereen. 

You will keep the peace while the 

people choose their own leaders. 

Fuck Meereen. 

Fuck the people. 

I m here for you  not them. 

You promised me. 

 My sword is yours. 

My life is yours.  

 i This is what I command.  i  

If I m going to rule in Westeros  

I ll need to make alliances. 

The best way to make 

alliances is with marriage. 

Who are you marrying this time  

I don t know. 

Maybe no one. 

But you need to lure all the 

noble houses to the table  

Are you a queen or fish bait  

I can t bring a lover to Westeros. 

A king wouldn t think twice about it. 

So that s what you want  

To be my mistress  

I m not proud. I don t care 

what perfumed aristocrat 

sits beside you in the throne room. 

I don t want a crown. 

I want you. 

I love you. 

And I make you happy. 

You know I do. 

Bring me with you. 

Let me fight for you. 

I can t. 

The dwarf told you to do this  

 i No one tells me to do anything.  i  

Clever fellow. 

Can t argue with his logic. 

I m no use to you over there. 

Don t get angry. 

I m not angry. 

I m full of self pity. 

Who comes after you  

Who can ever follow Daenerys 

Stormborn  the Mother of Dragons  

A great number of women  I imagine. 

Specific orders will be left for you 

regarding the welfare of Meereen 

and the Bay of Dragons. 

Bay of Dragons  

We can t call it Slaver s 

Bay anymore  can we  

You ll get that throne you 

want so badly  I m sure of it. 

I hope it brings you happiness. 

I pity the lords of Westeros. 

They have no idea 

what s coming for them. 

Farewell  Daario Naharis. 

How did he take it  

No tears. 

I know it was hard for you. 

You turned away a man 

who truly loves you 

because he would have been a 

liability in the Seven Kingdoms. 

That s the kind of self sacrifice 

that makes for a good ruler  

if it s any consolation. 

It s not. 

No  I suppose not. 

I m terrible at consoling. 

Yes  you really are. 

All right  how about the fact 

that this is actually happening  

You have your armies  

you have your ships  

you have your dragons. 

Everything you ve ever wanted 

since you were old enough 

to want anything  

it s all yours for the taking. 

Are you afraid  

Good. 

You re in the great game now. 

And the great game s terrifying. 

The only people who 

aren t afraid of failure 

are madmen like your father. 

Do you know what frightens me  

I said farewell 

to a man who loves me. 

A man I thought I cared for. 

And I felt nothing. 

Just impatient to get on with it. 

He wasn t the first to love you 

and he won t be the last. 

Well  you have completely 

failed to console me. 

For what it s worth  

I ve been a cynic 

for as long as I can remember. 

Everyone s always asking me 

to believe in things   

family  gods  kings  myself. 

It was often tempting 

until I saw where belief got people. 

So I said no  thank you to belief. 

And yet here I am. 

I believe in you. 

It s embarrassing  really. 

I d swear you my sword  

but I don t actually own a sword. 

It s your counsel I need. 

It s yours. 

Now and always. 

Good. 

I  um... 

I had something made for you. 

I m not sure if it s right. 

Tyrion Lannister  

I name you Hand of the Queen. 

You re not one of mine  are you  

No  my lord. 

Didn t think so. 

Too pretty. 

Where are my damn moron sons  

Black Walder and Lothar 

promised to be here by midday. 

They re here  my lord. 

Well  what are they doing  

trimming their cunt hairs  

Tell them to come here now. 

But they re already here  my lord. 

Here  my lord. 

They weren t easy to carve. 

Especially Black Walder. 

What... 

My name is Arya Stark. 

I want you to know that. 

The last thing 

you re ever going to see 

is a Stark smiling down 

at you as you die. 

Forgive me  my lady... 

if you re at prayer. 

I m done with all that. 

I came here every day 

when I was a girl. 

I prayed to be somewhere else. 

Back then I only thought 

about what I wanted  

never about what I had. 

I was a stupid girl. 

You were a child. 

What do you want  

I thought you knew what I wanted. 

I was wrong. 

No  you weren t. 

Every time I m faced with a decision  

I close my eyes and see 

the same picture. 

Whenever I consider 

an action  I ask myself 

will this action help to make 

this picture a reality  

Pull it out of my mind 

and into the world  

And I only act if the answer is yes. 

A picture of me on the Iron Throne... 

and you by my side. 

It s a pretty picture. 

News of this battle will spread 

quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. 

I ve declared for House 

Stark for all to hear. 

You ve declared for other 

houses before  Lord Baelish. 

It s never stopped you 

from serving yourself. 

The past is gone for good. 

You can sit here 

mourning its departure 

or you can prepare for the future. 

You  my love  

are the future of House Stark. 

Who should the North rally behind  

A trueborn daughter 

of Ned and Catelyn Stark 

born here at Winterfell 

or a motherless bastard 

born in the south  

This is where I leave you. 

You re not coming with us  

The Wall is not just ice and stone. 

Ancient spells were carved 

into its foundations. 

Strong magic 

to protect men from what lies beyond. 

And while it stands  

the dead cannot pass. 

I cannot pass. 

Where will you go  

The great war is coming 

 i and I still fight for the living.  i  

I ll do what I can... 

as long as I can. 

Thank you  Uncle Benjen. 

I wish you both good fortune. 

Are you sure you re ready for this  

I m the Three Eyed 

Raven now. 

I have to be ready for this. 

 i Ned   i  

Lyanna. 

Is that you  

Is that really you  

You re not a dream  

No  I m not a dream. 

I m here. 

Right here. 

I ve missed you  big brother. 

I ve missed you  too. 

I want to be brave. 

Shh. 

You are. 

I m not. 

I don t want to die. 

You re not going to die. 

Get her some water. 

  No  no water. 

  Is there a maester  

Listen to me  Ned. 

If Robert 

finds out  he ll   

you know he will. 

You have to protect him. 

Promise me  Ned. 

Promise me. 

Promise me  Ned. 

Promise me. 

You can t expect Knights of the Vale 

to side with wildling invaders. 

We didn t invade. 

We were invited. 

Not by me. 

The free folk  the northerners  

and the Knights of the Vale 

fought bravely  

fought together  and we won. 

My father used to say we find our 

true friends on the battlefield. 

The Boltons are defeated. 

The war is over. 

Winter has come. 

If the maesters are right  it ll be 

the coldest one in a thousand years. 

We should ride home 

and wait out the coming storms. 

The war is not over. 

And I promise you  friend  

the true enemy 

won t wait out the storm. 

He brings the storm. 

Your son was butchered at the 

Red Wedding  Lord Manderly  

but you refused the call. 

You swore allegiance 

to House Stark  Lord Glover  

but in their hour of greatest need  

you refused the call. 

 i And you  Lord Cerwyn   i  

your father was skinned 

alive by Ramsay Bolton. 

Still you refused the call. 

 i But House Mormont remembers.  i  

The North remembers. 

We know no king but the King in 

the North whose name is Stark. 

 i I don t care if he s a bastard.  i  

 i Ned Stark s blood 

runs through his veins.  i  

He s my king from this 

day until his last day. 

Lady Mormont speaks harshly 

and truly. 

My son died for Robb Stark  

the Young Wolf. 

I didn t think we d find 

another king in my lifetime. 

I didn t commit my men to your cause 

 cause I didn t want more 

Manderlys dying for nothing. 

But I was wrong. 

Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. 

 i He is the White Wolf.  i  

The King in the North. 

I did not fight 

beside you on the field 

and I will regret that 

until my dying day. 

 i A man can only admit 

when he was wrong  i  

and ask forgiveness. 

There s nothing to forgive  my lord. 

There will be more fights to come. 

House Glover will stand 

behind House Stark 

as we have for a thousand years. 

And I will stand behind Jon Snow... 

the King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

The King in the North  

 i Company halt   i  

 i Halt   i  

 i Halt   i  

Come on. 

I now proclaim Cersei 

of the House Lannister 

First of Her Name  

 i Queen of the Andals 

and the First Men   i  

Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. 

 i Long may she reign.  i  

 i Long may she reign.  i  

 i   bird screeches    i  

Your Grace  

I want to say   

You will not speak. 

How do I know you are 

who you say you are  

If only I were otherwise. 

If you are Tyrion Lannister  

why shouldn t I kill you 

to pay your family back 

for what it did to mine  

You want revenge 

against the Lannisters  

I killed my mother 

Joanna Lannister 

on the day I was born. 

I killed my father Tywin Lannister with 

a bolt to the heart. 

I am the greatest 

Lannister killer of our time. 

So I should welcome you 

into my service 

because you murdered members 

of your own family  

Into your service  

Your Grace  we have 

only just met. 

It s too soon to know 

if you deserve my service. 

If you d rather return 

to the fighting pits  

just say the word. 

When I was a young man  

I heard a story 

about a baby born 

during the worst storm in living memory. 

She had no wealth  

no lands  no army  

 i only a name  i  

 i and a handful of supporters   i  

most of whom probably thought they 

could use that name to benefit themselves. 

They kept her alive  

moving her from place to place  

 i often hours ahead of the men  i  

 i who d been sent to kill her.  i  

 i She was eventually sold off to  i  

 i some warlord on the edge of the world  i  

 i and that appeared  i  

 i to be that.  i  

 i And then  i  

 i a few years later   i  

the most well informed 

person I knew 

told me that this girl 

without wealth  lands  or armies 

had somehow acquired all three 

in a very short span of time  

along with three dragons. 

 i He thought  i  

 i she was our best   i  

 i last chance to build  i  

 i a better world.  i  

I thought you were worth 

meeting at the very least. 

And why are you 

worth meeting  

Why should I spend 

my time listening to you  

Because you cannot build 

a better world on your own. 

You have no one at your side who 

understands the land you want to rule. 

The strengths 

and weaknesses of the houses 

 i that will either  i  

 i join or oppose you.  i  

I will have 

a very large army 

and very large dragons. 

Killing and politics 

aren t always the same thing. 

When I served 

as Hand of the King  

I did quite well with the latter 

considering the king in question 

preferred torturing animals 

to leading his people. 

I could do 

an even better job 

advising a ruler 

worth the name. 

 i If that is indeed  i  

 i what you are.  i  

So you want 

to advise me  

Very well. 

What would you 

have me do with him  

 i I swore I would kill him  i  

 i if he ever returned.  i  

I know. 

Why should the people 

trust a queen who can t keep her promises  

Whomever Ser Jorah 

was when he started informing on you  

he is no longer that man. 

I can t remember 

ever seeing a sane man 

as devoted to anything 

as he is to serving you. 

 i He claims he would kill  i  

 i for you and die for you  i  

 i and nothing I ever witnessed  i  

 i gives me reason to doubt him.  i  

And yet he did 

betray you. 

Did he have an opportunity 

to confess his betrayal  

Yes. 

Many opportunities. 

Tyrion  

 i And did he   i  

No  not until 

forced to do so. 

He worships you. 

He is in love 

with you  I think. 

 i But he did not trust you  i  

 i with the truth.  i  

 i An unpleasant truth  i  

 i to be sure   i  

 i but one of great  i  

 i significance to you.  i  

 i He did not trust that you would  i  

 i be wise  enough to forgive him.  i  

So I should kill him  

A ruler who kills 

those devoted to her 

is not a ruler 

who inspires devotion. 

And you re going to need 

to inspire devotion  

a lot of it  if you re ever going to rule 

across the Narrow Sea. 

But you cannot have him 

by your side when you do. 

Remove Ser Jorah 

from the city. 

 i   door slams    i  

Confess. 

My son. 

Let me speak to   

Confess. 

I meant it. 

My face will be 

the last thing you see   

 i   door opens    i  

  sobbing   

  screams   

My name is Lanna. 

I m an orphan. 

 i When I was eight   i  

 i I begged enough money  i  

 i to buy my first  i  

 i bucket of oysters.  i  

I sold that bucket and made 

enough money to buy two more. 

 i   people chattering    i  

Arya   i It took a while   i  

 i but I finally saved enough  i  

 i to buy myself  i  

 i an oyster cart.  i  

 i Now every morning   i  

 i I make my way  i  

 i down to the canals.  i  

 i I pass the fish mongers  i  

 i and the bakers.  i  

 i I usually see Lhara   i  

 i my first customer of the day  i  

 i on her way home.  i  

 i Then I turn left  i  

 i onto Moonsinger Lane    i  

  cracks   

Turn left 

onto Ragman Lane 

where I do 

most of my trade. 

Lanna is very impressive. 

Very industrious. 

She will make a fine servant 

for the Many Faced God. 

How will she serve him  

She will no longer 

turn left onto Ragman Lane. 

She will turn right 

and go to Ragman Harbor. 

What will she do there  

She will see. 

   i   people chattering    i  

  Arya   i See what   i  

Jaqen   i How can a man  i  

 i tell a girl this   i  

 i If he knew  i  

 i what she would see   i  

 i there would be  i  

 i no reason to send her.  i  

Oysters  clams  

and cockles  

  laughs   

Oysters  clams  

and cockles  

Oysters  clams  

and cockles  

Your oysters fresh  

Best in the city. 

You wouldn t lie 

to an old man  would you  

Mm. 

Very nice. 

Give me four with vinegar. 

It s my  voyage. 

Returned from all of them 

without a scratch on me. 

Can t do it. 

Captain   i Please   i  

 i I ve three children.  i  

 i Without me...  i  

Here  take it. 

You have to. 

I ve three children. 

  What will they do  

  Come on. 

They ve nothing 

without me. 

 i Please  you have to   i  

Please  you don t 

understand  

 i Please   i  

Jaqen  

 i The man is a gambler.  i  

He wages that 

a sailor s ship 

will make it 

to its destination. 

It is a strange wager 

for the captain. 

He only wins 

if he loses his life. 

So why would a captain make the wager 

in the first place  

A girl tells a man 

that she has seen. 

If the captain dies  

the thin man pays 

his family a lot of money. 

But perhaps the gambler 

loses his bet 

and decides he does not 

have to pay after all. 

A destitute woman 

and her small child  

what can they do to such a man 

if he keeps their money for himself  

To whom can they turn 

for recourse  

  whispering prayer   

The Many Faced God. 

You said you didn t know 

what I would see at the docks. 

A man had no idea what a girl would see 

and what she would not. 

A girl named Lanna 

will return to the docks. 

She will watch 

the gambler. 

 i She will come to know as much about  i  

 i him as she knows about herself.  i  

And then what  

A gift for the thin man. 

She s not ready. 

Perhaps she is  

perhaps she s not. 

And if she s not  

It is all the same 

to the Many Faced God. 

 i   door unlocks  opens    i  

 i   door locks    i  

The trial 

will take place soon. 

 i The High Sparrow  i  

 i will be presenting  i  

 i a substantial case  i  

 i against you.  i  

The charges  

 i Fornication   i  

 i treason  incest   i  

the murder 

of King Robert. 

All lies. 

Of course  

Your Grace. 

My concern is that 

the Faith does not adhere 

to the same standards 

of proof as the crown. 

 i I hope you ll excuse me  i  

 i for saying it   i  

 i but belief is so often  i  

 i the death of reason.  i  

I wish you had 

said it sooner. 

Is there any word 

from Jaime  

No  I m afraid not. 

Your Grace  

Grand Maester Pycelle 

has summoned 

your Uncle Kevan 

back from Casterly Rock 

to serve 

as Hand of the King. 

He now presides 

over the small council. 

Tell him I need 

to speak to him. 

I implored him to visit you  

but he would not. 

What about my son  

the king  

If you can visit me  

then surely the king... 

Your arrest 

and Queen Margaery s arrest  

the king has not 

taken them well. 

 i He remains  i  

 i in his chambers.  i  

His servants often find 

his food in the hall left untouched. 

You need to talk to him. 

You need to talk to my son and tell him 

to come and see me  

come and see his mother. 

He   I tried  

Your Grace. 

He wouldn t see me. 

He won t see anyone. 

I can t stay here. 

There is a way  

Your Grace. 

A way out. 

Confess  

To the High Sparrow  

I won t. 

I made him. 

I rose him up 

from nothing. 

I will not kneel before 

some barefooted commoner 

and beg his forgiveness. 

Good bye  my queen. 

The work continues. 

Why  

Why  Theon  

I m not Theon. 

There is no Theon. 

  Reek. 

  Reek. 

Why did you 

tell him  Reek  

I was helping you. 

You wanted to escape. 

There is no escape. 

Not ever. 

Theon Greyjoy 

tried to escape. 

The master knew. 

He knows everything. 

He hunted him 

and caught him 

and strapped him 

to a cross 

and cut away 

piece after piece 

until there 

was no Theon left. 

Good. 

If it weren t for you  

I d still have a family. 

If I could do 

what Ramsay did to you 

right here  

right now  I would. 

I deserved everything. 

I deserve to be Reek. 

 i I did terrible things.  i  

Turned on Robb. 

Captured Winterfell. 

  Killed those boys. 

  They weren t  those boys.  

They were Bran and Rickon. 

They were your brothers. 

You ve known them 

since they were born. 

They weren t. 

They were only   

Only what  

  I can t. 

  Tell me. 

I can t  not unless 

the master says. 

  Tell me. They weren t what  

  They weren t   

Tell me why Bran 

and Rickon should be gone 

while you still 

breathe the air. 

Tell me 

to my face  Theon. 

Tell me that they 

weren t your brothers  

They weren t 

Bran and Rickon  

I couldn t find them. 

It was two farm boys. 

I killed them and burned them 

so no one would know. 

You didn t  

Do you know where they went  

Bran and Rickon  

I can t talk 

to you anymore. 

Theon  you have to tell me. 

Do you have any idea where   

Not Theon  Reek  

 i   door closes    i  

Our scouts tell us 

he s got no more than   men. 

More than half of those 

are mounted  however. 

And how high do 

Stannis s horses jump  

Our walls have been 

fully repaired. 

The gates have been 

reinforced. 

We have enough food 

for six months. 

We are more prepared 

for a siege than they could ever be. 

All we have to do 

is wait for them to freeze  

starve  and mutiny. 

You disagree  

Stannis isn t 

from the North. 

You are  Father. 

I think you re missing an opportunity 

to show the people of the North 

 i how House Bolton  i  

 i treats southern invaders.  i  

And what 

do you recommend  

 i That we not sit  i  

 i and wait for Stannis  i  

 i to decide what sort of fight  i  

 i this is going to be.  i  

That we hit first 

and hit hard 

and leave a feast 

for the crows. 

A smart commander does not 

abandon a defensive advantage. 

 i As long as we stay  i  

 i behind these walls   i  

 i they can t touch us.  i  

Not to mention 

that the snow is so deep  

we couldn t get 

an army through to engage them 

even if we wanted to. 

I don t need an army. 

I need  good men. 

So  have you 

decided yet  

Whether I m worthy 

of your service  

Have you decided yet 

whether you re going to have me killed  

It s probably 

my safest option. 

I can see why 

you would think so. 

It s what your father 

would have done. 

And what would 

your father have done  

My father  

who publically 

sentenced me to death  

I d say his thoughts on having me killed 

were abundantly clear. 

Is that why 

you killed him  

Someday if you decide 

not to execute me  

I ll tell you all about 

why I killed my father. 

And on that day  

should it ever come  

we ll need 

more wine than this. 

I know 

what my father was. 

 i What he did.  i  

I know the Mad King 

earned his name. 

So  here we sit. 

Two terrible children 

of two terrible fathers. 

I m terrible  

I ve heard stories. 

Why did you travel to the far side 

of the world to meet someone terrible  

To see if you were 

the right kind of terrible. 

Which kind is that  

The kind that prevents 

your people from being even more so. 

Well  I did reopen 

the fighting pits. 

Under my rule  murder will once again 

become entertainment. 

Yes  that was wise. 

And you agreed to marry someone 

you loathe for the greater good. 

Very impressive. 

 i My own sister married someone  i  

 i she loathed as well   i  

though not by choice 

and certainly not 

for the greater good  

gods forbid. 

She ended up 

having him killed. 

Perhaps it won t 

come to that. 

It s not impossible that Varys was right 

about you after all. 

Varys  

King Robert s spymaster  

Yes  he s the one 

who convinced me to come find you. 

He was my travelling 

companion 

before Ser Jorah seized 

that role for himself. 

Jorah sent my secrets 

to Varys. 

For  years the Spider oversaw 

the campaign to find and kill me. 

He did what he had 

to do to survive. 

He did a lot of other things as well  

things he didn t have to do. 

 i I suspect he s the main reason  i  

 i you weren t slaughtered in your crib.  i  

But you trust him  

 i Yes  oddly.  i  

He may be the only person 

in the world I trust. 

Except my brother. 

The brother 

who killed my father  

That s the one. 

Perhaps I will have you 

killed after all. 

Your queenly prerogative. 

I had given up on life 

until Varys convinced me 

you might be worth living for. 

If you chop off 

my head  well  

my final days 

were interesting. 

I m not 

going to kill you. 

No  Banish me  

No. 

So if I m not going 

to be murdered 

and I m not going 

to be banished   

You re going 

to advise me. 

While you can still speak 

in complete sentences. 

Advise you on what  

How to get 

what I want. 

The Iron Throne. 

Perhaps you should try 

wanting something else. 

If I want jokes  

I ll get myself a proper fool. 

 i I m not entirely joking.  i  

 i There s more to the world  i  

 i than Westeros after all.  i  

How many hundreds of thousands of lives 

have you changed for the better here  

Perhaps this 

is where you belong  

where you can do 

the most good. 

I fought so that no child 

born into Slaver s Bay 

would ever know 

what it meant to be bought or sold. 

 i I will continue  i  

 i that fight here and beyond.  i  

But this is not my home. 

When you get back to your home  

who supports you  

The common people. 

Let s be generous 

and assume that s going to happen. 

Here in Slaver s Bay  

you had the support of the common people 

and only 

the common people. 

What was that like  

Ruling without the rich  

House Targaryen is gone. 

Not a single person who shares 

your blood is alive to support you. 

 i The Starks  i  

 i are gone as well.  i  

 i Our two terrible fathers  i  

 i saw to that.  i  

 i The remaining members  i  

 i of House Lannister  i  

 i will never back you   i  

 i not ever.  i  

Stannis Baratheon 

won t back you  either. 

His entire claim to the throne rests on 

the illegitimacy of yours. 

 i That leaves the Tyrells.  i  

Not impossible  

not enough. 

Lannister  Targaryen  

Baratheon  Stark  Tyrell. 

They re all just spokes 

on a wheel. 

This one s on top  

then that one s on top. 

And on and on it spins  crushing 

those on the ground. 

It s a beautiful dream  

stopping the wheel. 

You re not the first person 

who s ever dreamt it. 

I m not going 

to stop the wheel. 

I m going to break 

the wheel. 

  grunting   

  whistles   

You said whoever wins will fight 

at the Great Pit in front of the queen. 

I won. 

You struck me. 

Have me flogged 

if it makes you happy. 

But I m the best 

you ve got. 

If I win 

at the Great Pit  

how much can you 

sell me for  

You re a free man. 

You could have 

gone anywhere. 

Why did you come back  

Let me fight for her 

and I belong to you. 

Woman  

 i Thirsty   i  

Confess. 

I ll get out of here  

you realize  before long. 

Confess. 

I can make you 

a wealthy woman. 

A lady of the court. 

Confess. 

Or I can make sure you die in the most 

hideous way imaginable. 

And all I do is sit here 

imagining hideous ways 

for you to die. 

 i   door opens    i  

 i   door closes  locks    i  

  slurping   

 i   wind howling    i  

Does it hurt  

No. 

Good. 

How are you  

I m not the one who got punched 

and kicked in the face. 

You know what I mean. 

I m good. 

  Are you scared  

  A little. 

Me  too. 

 i   knocks on door    i  

  Who s there  

   i Olly.  i  

Oh. 

Come in. 

I heard what happened. 

Oh  not to worry. 

Men brawl from time to time. 

It s only natural. 

Figured you were hungry. 

Oh  you re a good lad. 

Wanted to ask you 

something 

if you ve got the time. 

I need to check 

on baby Sam. 

 i   door closes    i  

Sam   i Now then   i  

 i how can I help   i  

  It s about the Lord Commander. 

  Yes  

He s going up to Hardhome 

to save all them wildlings. 

Wildlings killed 

my mom and dad. 

They killed everyone 

in my village. 

We ve been 

fighting them for years. 

 i This wasn t a fight.  i  

We were farmers 

and they slaughtered us. 

So why is he saving them  

Wildlings are people. 

Just like us  there are good ones 

and bad ones. 

The one he s travelling with  

the one with the red beard  

he led the raid 

on my village. 

   i Oh  Olly.  i  

  How can he trust him  

I ve seen the army 

of the dead. 

 i I ve seen  i  

 i the white walkers.  i  

And they re coming for us  

for all the living. 

And when it s time  

we ll need every 

last man we can find. 

But what if we let 

the wildlings through the gates 

and they cut our throats 

while we sleep  

Jon s taking a risk  

but he has to. 

We don t stand 

a chance otherwise. 

 i Sometimes a man  i  

 i has to make hard choices   i  

 i choices that might look  i  

 i wrong to others   i  

 i but you know are right  i  

 i in the long run.  i  

You believe that  

With all my heart. 

 i Try not to worry  Olly.  i  

I ve been worrying 

about Jon for years. 

He always comes back. 

  wind howling   

  men grunting   

Ranger  

 i Turn us about   i  

You trust me  

Jon Snow  

Does that 

make me a fool  

We re fools 

together now. 

 i   man whistles    i  

Lord of Bones. 

Been a long time. 

Last time I saw you  

the little crow was your prisoner. 

The other way around now. 

What happened  

War. 

War  

You call that a war  

The greatest army 

the North has ever seen 

cut to pieces 

by some southern king. 

We should gather 

the elders  

find somewhere 

quiet to talk. 

You don t give 

the orders here. 

I m not giving an order. 

Why aren t you 

in chains  

He s not my prisoner. 

No  

What is he  

We re allies. 

You fucking traitor. 

You fight 

for the crows now  

I don t fight 

for the crows. 

We re not here to fight. 

We re here to talk. 

Is that right  

You and the pretty crow 

do a lot of talking  Tormund  

And when 

you re done talking  

do you get down on your knees 

and suck his cock  

  grunts   

Gather the elders 

and let s talk. 

 i   man coughs    i  

My name s Jon Snow. 

I m Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch. 

We re not friends. 

 i We ve never been friends.  i  

 i We won t become  i  

 i friends today.  i  

 i This isn t  i  

 i about friendship.  i  

This is about 

survival. 

This is about putting 

a  foot wall 

between you 

and what s out there. 

You built that wall 

to keep us out. 

Since when do the crows 

give two shits if we live  

Jon   i In normal times we wouldn t.  i  

 i But these aren t normal times.  i  

The white walkers 

don t care if a man s free folk or crow. 

We re all the same to them  

meat for their army. 

But together 

we can beat them. 

Beat the white walkers  

Good luck with that. 

Run from them  maybe. 

It s not a trick. 

It s a gift 

for those who join us. 

Dragonglass. 

A man of the Night s Watch 

used one of these daggers 

 i to kill a walker.  i  

  You saw this  

  No. 

But I trust the man. 

There are old stories 

about dragonglass. 

There are old stories 

about ice spiders as big as hounds. 

And with the things 

we ve seen  you don t believe them  

Jon   i Come with me and I ll share  i  

 i these weapons.  i  

Come with you where  

Jon   i There are good lands  i  

 i south of the Wall.  i  

 i The Night s Watch will let you  i  

 i through the tunnel  i  

and allow your people 

to farm those lands. 

  murmuring   

I knew Mance Rayder. 

 i He never wanted a war  i  

 i with the Night s Watch.  i  

 i He wanted a new life  i  

 i for his people  for you.  i  

We re prepared 

to give you that new life. 

If  

If you swear you ll join us 

when the real war begins. 

Where is Mance  

  He died. 

  How  

I put an arrow 

through his heart. 

    wildlings shouting   

  Tormund  Hey  hey. 

Hey  hey  hey  

hey  hey. 

Hey  hey  hey. 

Loboda   i I say we send  i  

 i the Lord Commander  i  

back to Castle Black 

with no eyes. 

Hey  none of you 

saw Mance die. 

I did. 

The southern king 

who broke our army  Stannis  

wanted to burn him alive 

to send us a message. 

Jon Snow defied 

that cunt s orders. 

His arrow was mercy. 

What he did 

took courage. 

And that s 

what we need today  

the courage 

to make peace 

with men we ve been killing 

for generations. 

I lost my father  

my uncle  

and two brothers 

fighting the damn crows. 

I m not asking you 

to forget your dead. 

I ll never 

forget mine. 

I lost  brothers 

the night that Mance attacked the Wall. 

But I m asking you 

to think about 

your children now. 

 i They ll never have  i  

 i children of their own  i  

 i if we don t band together.  i  

The Long Night 

is coming 

and the dead 

come with it. 

No clan can stop them. 

The free folk 

can t stop them. 

The Night s Watch 

can t stop them. 

And all the southern kings 

can t stop them. 

 i Only together   i  

 i all of us.  i  

And even then 

it may not be enough  

but at least we ll give 

the fuckers a fight. 

You vouch 

for this man  Tormund  

He s prettier 

than both my daughters  

 i but he knows  i  

 i how to fight.  i  

He s young  

but he knows how to lead. 

He didn t have 

to come to Hardhome. 

He came because 

he needs us 

and we need him. 

My ancestors 

would spit on me 

if I broke bread 

with a crow. 

So would mine  

but fuck  em  they re dead. 

  sighs   

I ll never trust 

a man in black. 

But I trust you  

Tormund. 

If you say 

this is the way  

we re with you. 

  This is the way. 

    murmuring   

Elder  

 i I m with Tormund.  i  

We stay here  

we re dead men. 

At least with King Crow  

there s a chance. 

 i   giant growls    i  

Tormund. 

Keep that new life 

you want to give us. 

And keep your glass  

King Crow. 

As soon as you get on 

his ships  they re gonna slit your throats 

and dump your bodies 

to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. 

That s our enemy. 

That has always 

been our enemy. 

I fucking hate Thenns. 

  chatter   

  Man  Move it. 

  Woman  Be careful. 

  Man     i Move  em along  now.  i  

  Man     i Cast off time.  i  

 i That s it  come on.  i  

How many are with us  

I m not good 

at counting. 

We re leaving 

too many behind. 

The free folk 

are stubborn. 

You know how long 

it took Mance to band them together  

 fucking years. 

And he knew them better 

than I ever will. 

They re running out of food 

and there s nothing to hunt. 

They ll come around. 

  Jon   i Get yourselves ready.  i  

  Man   i Aye   i  

Johnna is gonna 

look after you. 

She s in charge. 

You listen to her. 

Man   i Take her.  i  

 i There you are.  i  

I want to go with you. 

I need to get 

the old folks on the boats. 

I m right behind you. 

I promise. 

Go on. 

 i   overlapping voices    i  

 i Another one.  i  

 i Keep moving.  i  

 i We ll meet you out there.  i  

 i Won t be able to take that on the boat.  i  

 i It s too big.  i  

   i That s the last one   i  

   i Three more  Move on   i  

 i   overlapping voices continue    i  

 i There s more dragonglass everywhere.  i  

  growls   

 i I ve got some more daggers  i  

 i over here.  i  

 i Put that dagger  i  

 i in his bag.  i  

Uh...

So should you. 

My little girls got on. 

They re gonna let them 

pass the Wall even if you re not there  

You have my word. 

I ve given orders.

Myrcella  

Myrcella  

Kill us  

I may have found a 

way to treat Ser Jorah. 

Please try not to scream. 

This is Brandon Stark. 

Son of Ned Stark. 

Let s get them inside. 

For decades  House Lannister 

has been the true power in Westeros  

and the seat of that 

power is Casterly Rock. 

Grey Worm and the Unsullied 

will sail for the Rock  

and take it. 

Summon Jon Snow. 

He would make a valuable ally. 

Let him stand before you 

and tell you the things 

that have happened to him. 

Dragonstone sits on a 

mountain of dragonglass. 

We can never hope to defeat 

the army of the dead alone. 

We need allies. 

You re abandoning your people  

You re abandoning your home. 

Until I return  the North is yours. 

The bastard of Winterfell. 

The dwarf of Casterly Rock. 

I believe we last saw 

each other atop the Wall. 

You were pissing off the 

edge if I remember right. 

Picked up some scars along the road. 

It s been a long road  

but we re both still here. 

I m Tyrion Lannister. 

  Davos Seaworth. 

  Ah  the Onion Knight. 

We fought on opposite sides at 

the Battle of Blackwater Bay. 

Unluckily for me. 

Missandei is the queen s 

most trusted advisor. 

Welcome to Dragonstone. 

Our queen knows it is a long journey. 

She appreciates the efforts 

you have made on her behalf. 

If you wouldn t mind 

handing over your weapons. 

Of course. 

Please  this way. 

Where are you from  

I can t place the accent. 

I was born on the Island of Naath. 

Ah. I hear it s beautiful down there. 

Palm trees and butterflies. 

Haven t been  myself. 

This place has changed. 

And Sansa  I hear she s alive and well. 

  She is. 

  Does she miss me terribly  

A sham marriage. And unconsummated. 

  I didn t ask. 

  Well  it was. Wasn t. 

Anyway... 

she s much smarter than she lets on. 

She s starting to let on. 

Good. 

At some point  

I want to hear how a Night s Watch 

recruit became King in the North. 

As long as you tell me how a Lannister 

became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen. 

A long and bloody tale. 

To be honest  I was 

drunk for most of it. 

My bannermen think I m 

a fool for coming here. 

Of course they do. 

If I was your Hand  I would 

have advised against it. 

General rule of thumb... 

Stark men don t fare well 

when they travel south. 

True... 

but I m not a Stark. 

I d say you get used to them... 

but you never really do. 

Come  their mother is waiting for you. 

I wondered why you weren t 

there to meet our guests. 

You begged us to summon 

the King in the North. 

Don t you want to see him again  

I ve done my part. 

I ve brought ice and fire together. 

Strange. 

You spoke so highly of Jon Snow  

but when he arrives  

you hide on a cliff. 

I didn t take you for a bashful girl. 

My time whispering in the ears 

of kings has come to an end. 

Oh  I doubt that. 

Give us common folk one taste of power  

we re like the lion who tasted man. 

Nothing is ever so sweet again. 

Neither of us is common folk anymore. 

I did not part on good terms 

with the King in the 

North or his advisor. 

Why  

Because of mistakes I made. 

Terrible mistakes. 

I would only be a 

distraction if I stayed. 

  So  where will you go  

  Volantis. 

Good. 

If you don t mind my saying  

I don t think you should 

return to Westeros. 

I m not sure you d be safe here. 

Oh  I will return  dear Spider. 

  One last time. 

  My lady... 

I have to die in this strange country. 

Just like you. 

You stand in the presence 

of Daenerys Stormborn 

of House Targaryen  

rightful heir to the Iron Throne  

rightful Queen of the 

Andals and the First Men  

Protector of the Seven Kingdoms  

the Mother of Dragons  

the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea  

the Unburnt  the Breaker of Chains. 

This is Jon Snow. 

He s King in the North. 

Thank you for traveling so far  my lord. 

I hope the seas weren t too rough. 

The winds were kind  Your Grace. 

Apologies  I have a Flea 

Bottom accent  I know  

but Jon Snow is King in 

the North  Your Grace. 

  He s not a lord. 

  Forgive me... 

Your Grace  this is Ser Davos Seaworth. 

Forgive me  Ser Davos. 

I never did receive a formal education  

but I could have sworn I read 

the last King in the 

North was Torrhen Stark  

who bent the knee to my 

ancestor  Aegon Targaryen. 

In exchange for his life and 

the lives of the Northmen  

Torrhen Stark swore fealty to 

House Targaryen in perpetuity. 

Or do I have my facts wrong  

I wasn t there  Your Grace. 

No  of course not. 

But still  an oath is an oath. 

And perpetuity means... 

what does perpetuity mean  Lord Tyrion  

Forever. 

Forever. 

So I assume  my lord... 

... you re here to bend the knee. 

I am not. 

Oh. 

Well  that is unfortunate. 

You ve traveled all this way 

to break faith with House Targaryen  

Break faith  

Your father burned my grandfather alive. 

He burned my uncle alive. 

He would have burned 

the Seven Kingdoms... 

My father... was an evil man. 

On behalf of House Targaryen... 

I ask your forgiveness 

for the crimes he committed 

against your family. 

And I ask you not to judge a daughter 

by the sins of her father. 

Our two houses were 

allies for centuries  

and those were the best centuries 

the Seven Kingdoms have ever known. 

Centuries of peace and prosperity 

with a Targaryen sitting 

on the Iron Throne 

and a Stark serving 

as Warden of the North. 

I am the last Targaryen  Jon Snow. 

Honor the pledge your 

ancestor made to mine. 

Bend the knee and I will 

name you Warden of the North. 

Together  we will save this country 

from those who would destroy it. 

You re right. 

You re not guilty of 

your father s crimes. 

And I m not beholden 

to my ancestor s vows. 

Then why are you here  

Because I need your 

help  and you need mine. 

Did you see three dragons 

flying overhead when you arrived  

I did. 

And did you see the Dothraki  

all of whom have sworn to kill for me  

They re hard to miss. 

  But still  I need your help  

  Not to defeat Cersei. 

You could storm King s Landing 

tomorrow and the city would fall. 

Hell  we almost took it and 

we didn t even have dragons. 

  Almost. 

  But you haven t stormed King s Landing. 

Why not  

The only reason I can see 

is you don t want to kill 

thousands of innocent people. 

It s the fastest way to win the war  

but you won t do it  

which means  at the very least  

you re better than Cersei. 

Still  that doesn t explain 

why I need your help. 

Because right now  you and I 

and Cersei and everyone else  

we re children playing at a game  

screaming that the rules aren t fair. 

  You told me you liked this man. 

  I do. 

In the time since he s met me  

he s refused to call me queen  

he s refused to bow  and 

now he s calling me a child. 

I believe he s calling all of 

us children. Figure of speech. 

Your Grace  everyone you know 

will die before winter s over 

if we don t defeat 

the enemy to the north. 

As far as I can see  you 

are the enemy to the north. 

I am not your enemy. 

The dead are the enemy. 

The dead  

Is that another figure of speech  

The Army of the Dead is on the march. 

The Army of the Dead  

You don t know me well  my lord  

but do you think I m a liar or a madman  

No  I don t think you re 

either of those things. 

The Army of the Dead is real. 

The white walkers are real. 

The Night King is real. I ve seen them. 

If they get past the Wall 

and we re squabbling 

amongst ourselves... 

we re finished. 

I was born at Dragonstone. 

Not that I can remember it. 

We fled before Robert s 

assassins could find us. 

Robert was your 

father s best friend  no  

I wonder if your father knew 

his best friend sent assassins 

to murder a baby girl in her crib. 

Not that it matters now  of course. 

I spent my life in foreign lands. 

So many men have tried to kill me  

I don t remember all their names. 

I have been sold like a broodmare. 

I ve been chained and betrayed  

raped and defiled. 

Do you know what kept me standing 

through all those years in exile  

Faith. 

Not in any gods  

not in myths and legends. 

In myself. 

In Daenerys Targaryen. 

The world hadn t seen 

a dragon in centuries 

until my children were born. 

The Dothraki hadn t 

crossed the sea  any sea. 

They did for me. 

I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms  

and I will. 

You ll be ruling over a graveyard 

if we don t defeat the Night King. 

The war against my 

sister has already begun. 

You can t expect us to halt hostilities 

and join you in fighting 

whatever you saw beyond the Wall. 

You don t believe him. 

I understand that. It 

sounds like nonsense. 

But if destiny has brought Daenerys 

Targaryen back to our shores  

it has also made Jon 

Snow King in the North. 

You were the first to 

bring Dothraki to Westeros  

He is the first to make allies 

of wildlings and Northmen. 

He was named Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch. 

He was named King in the North. 

Not because of his birthright. 

He has no birthright. 

He s a damn bastard. 

All those hard sons of bitches 

chose him as their leader 

because they believe in him. 

All those things you don t believe in  

he faced those things. 

He fought those things 

for the good of his people. 

He risked his life for his people. 

He took a knife in the 

heart for his people. 

He gave his own... 

If we don t put aside our 

enmities and band together  

we will die. 

And then it doesn t matter whose 

skeleton sits on the Iron Throne. 

If it doesn t matter  then 

you might as well kneel. 

Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys  

help her to defeat my sister  

and together  our armies 

will protect the North. 

There s no time for that. 

There s no time for any of this  

While we stand here  debating... 

It takes no time to bend the knee. 

Pledge your sword to her cause. 

And why would I do that  

I mean no offense  Your Grace  

but I don t know you. 

As far as I can tell  

your claim to the throne rests 

entirely on your father s name  

and my own father fought 

to overthrow the Mad King. 

The lords of the North 

placed their trust in me to lead them  

and I will continue to 

do so as well as I can. 

That s fair. 

It s also fair to point out 

that I m the rightful 

Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. 

By declaring yourself king 

of the northernmost kingdom  

you are in open rebellion. 

Your Grace  please dismiss your guests. 

I have grave news. 

You must forgive my manners. 

You ll both be tired 

after your long journey. 

We ll have baths drawn for you 

and supper sent to your rooms. 

Am I your prisoner  

Not yet. 

Our ironborn and Dornish allies 

were attacked en route to Dorne. 

  And  

  Two or three ships escaped  

the rest  sunk or captured. 

Ellaria and the Sand 

Snakes  dead or captured. 

The Greyjoys  dead or captured. 

All of them  

  Pull  

  Heave  

Pull  

Your sister s dead  

Euron has her. 

You saw him take her  

  But you got away  

  I couldn t save her. 

I tried. 

You wouldn t be here if you tried. 

Come  men  

Sails up  

Murderer  

Whores  

Traitor  

This is the life. 

Look at them  cheering for a Greyjoy. 

I have to be honest  

this is making me hard. 

Did you see Little Theon s face 

right before he jumped overboard  

 Oh  no   

What a twat. 

  Whore  Whore  Whore  

  Murderers  

My queen  please accept this gift 

on behalf of all of your loyal 

subjects in the Iron Islands. 

I give you what no 

other man could give... 

justice. 

Justice for your murdered daughter. 

You ve proven yourself the greatest 

captain on the fourteen seas 

and a true friend to the crown. 

You deserve more than a true friend. 

And you deserve a proper 

reward for your heroism. 

There s only one reward I want. 

You shall have what 

your heart desires... 

when the war is won. 

With Euron Greyjoy 

commanding our naval forces 

and Jaime Lannister leading our armies  

the sons and daughters of Westeros 

shall defend our country. 

There s nothing quite like it  is there  

The love of the people. 

Though I suppose you wouldn t know. 

This same mob spat at 

my sister not long ago. 

And if you turn on us  

they ll cheer to see your 

head mounted on a spike. 

Or yours. 

They just like severed heads  really. 

Listen  if you have any advice at all  

I would love to hear it. 

When we have an hour or 

two to speak as brothers. 

Advice  

Does she like it gentle or rough  

A finger in the bum  

Shh  shh  shh  shh  not 

now. We ll talk later. 

I want you to know I understand. 

Even though we re enemies  you and I  

I understand the fury that drives you. 

I was there that day 

when Ser Gregor crushed 

your lover s head. 

If I close my eyes  

I can hear the sound of 

Oberyn s skull breaking. 

The sound of your scream. 

I never heard a sound like that. 

I thought   That s true love.  

Oberyn looked beautiful 

that day. He really did. 

No one moved like him. 

No one had such skill with a spear. 

Even Ser Gregor couldn t stop him. 

If only he hadn t taunted him. 

He could ve walked away and 

left poor Ser Gregor to die. 

But that wasn t your 

lover s way  was it  

Now he s buried somewhere. 

And here s Ser Gregor  

stronger than ever. 

That must be difficult for you. 

When my daughter was taken from me  

my only daughter... 

well  you can t imagine how that feels 

unless you ve lost a child. 

I fed her at my own breast 

even though they told me 

to give her to the wet nurse. 

I couldn t bear to see her 

in another woman s arms. 

I never got to have a mother  

but Myrcella did. 

She was mine  and you took her from me. 

Why did you do that  

Doesn t matter now. 

Your daughter s a beauty  too. 

Those brown eyes. 

Those lips. 

Perfect Dornish beauty. 

I imagine she s your favorite. 

I know  I know  we re not 

supposed to have favorites  

but still  we re only human. 

We love whom we love. 

I m sorry  I can t understand you. 

That gag makes it impossible to 

understand what you re saying. 

It must be frustrating. 

We all make our choices. 

You chose to murder my daughter. 

You must have felt powerful 

after you made that choice. 

Do you feel powerful now  

I don t sleep very well. 

Not at all  really. 

I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy 

and imagine ways of killing my enemies. 

How to destroy Ellaria Sand  the 

woman who murdered my only daughter. 

I thought about having Ser Gregor 

crush your skull the 

way he did Oberyn s. 

It would be poetic  I 

suppose  but fast  too fast. 

I thought about having him 

crush your daughter s skull. 

She s so beautiful. 

The thought of this lovely face 

cracking open like a duck egg  

no  it s just not right. 

Mama. 

Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know. 

Clever enough to learn what 

poison you used to murder Myrcella. 

The Long Goodbye  was that it  

  The Long Farewell. 

  That s the one. 

How long does the poison take  

Difficult to say... hours  days. 

It depends on the 

subject s constitution. 

  But death is certain  

  Oh  yes  Your Grace  quite certain. 

Your daughter will 

die here in this cell  

and you will be here 

watching when she does. 

You ll be here the rest of your days. 

If you refuse to eat  we ll 

force food down your throat. 

You will live to watch 

your daughter rot. 

To watch that beautiful face collapse... 

... to bone and dust. 

All the while contemplating 

the choices you ve made. 

Make sure the guards change 

the torches every few hours. 

I don t want her to miss a thing. 

No. 

Don t. 

What are you doing  No 

one can see us like this. 

I am the Queen of the Seven 

Kingdoms. I ll do as I please. 

Forgive me  Your Grace. 

The visitor from Braavos has arrived. 

Good. And we ll need 

fresh sheets for the bed. 

At once  Your Grace. 

No  thank you. 

My condolences  Your Grace  

on the death of your son. 

From all reports  he 

was a fine young man. 

The Iron Bank didn t send 

you here to offer condolences. 

Condolences and congratulations. 

To become the first ruling 

Queen of the Seven Kingdoms  

that s quite an accomplishment. 

The Iron Bank appreciates how you 

cast off the yoke of superstition  

freeing the crown from elements 

who sought to subvert the rule of law. 

The destruction of the Sept of 

Baelor was a tragic accident. 

Indeed  but sometimes 

tragedies are necessary 

to restore order and 

rational leadership. 

The Iron Bank wants its gold back. 

Your father never minced words either. 

But  yes  your debts are considerable. 

And you re now engaged in a 

conflict on several fronts. 

We both know how expensive war can be. 

And we both know gold wins wars. 

Your vaults are empty. 

Your late husband s 

profligacy saw to that. 

Your wealthiest allies  the 

Tyrells  are now your enemies. 

You are surrounded on all 

sides by rivals for the throne. 

And the Iron Bank wants 

to bet on a winner. 

We don t make bets. 

We invest in endeavors we 

deem likely to be successful. 

A fancy way of saying  bet.  

The war s already begun. 

I ve drawn first blood. 

I decapitated the Dornish snake. 

My armada owns the Narrow Sea. 

Euron Greyjoy s armada 

owns the Narrow Sea. 

Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me. 

For now. 

Daenerys Targaryen has 

three full grown dragons. 

How well do wooden ships fare 

against fire breathing dragons  

Her dragons might not be as 

invulnerable as some think. 

But let s talk about the Targaryen girl. 

You want to invest in her  

I m guessing the Iron Bank invested 

considerable gold in the slave trade. 

How are your profits 

now that Daenerys has 

freed all the slaves  

The slave trade has entered 

a downturn  it s true. 

From what I gather  

she considers herself 

more of a revolutionary than a monarch. 

In your experience  how do bankers 

usually fare with revolutionaries  

The Lannisters owe the Iron 

Bank quite a lot of money  

but Lannisters always pay their debts. 

Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons  

Your father s daughter  indeed. 

Give me a fortnight. 

Stay in King s Landing 

as my honored guest. 

And when you return to Braavos  

I swear to you  my debt 

will be paid in full. 

I came down here to brood over my 

failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. 

You re making it difficult. 

You look a lot better 

brooding than I do. 

You make me feel like I m 

failing at brooding over failing. 

I m a prisoner on this island. 

I wouldn t say you re a 

prisoner on this island. 

You re free to walk the castle  

the beaches  to go wherever you want. 

Except to my ship. 

You took my ship. 

I wouldn t say we took your ship. 

I m not playing word games with you. 

The dead are coming for us all. 

Why don t you figure out what to do 

about my missing fleet 

and murdered allies  

and I ll figure out what to 

do about your walking dead men. 

It s hard for me to 

fathom. It really is. 

If someone told me about the 

white walkers and the Night King... 

You probably don t believe me. 

I do  actually. 

You didn t before. 

 Grumkins and snarks   you called them. 

Do you remember  

You said it was all nonsense. 

It was nonsense. Everybody knew it. 

But then Mormont saw them 

and you saw them. 

And I trust the eyes of an honest man 

more than I trust what everybody knows. 

How do I convince 

people who don t know me 

that an enemy they don t believe 

in is coming to kill them all  

  Good question. 

  I know it s a good question. 

I m looking for an answer. 

People s minds aren t made 

for problems that large. 

White walkers  the Night King  

Army of the Dead... 

it s almost a relief to confront 

a comfortable  familiar 

monster like my sister. 

I need to help prepare my 

people for what s coming. 

I can t help them from here. 

I d like to leave. 

It seems unlikely that you 

became King in the North 

by giving up that easily. 

Everyone told me to learn 

from my father s mistakes. 

Don t go south. 

Don t answer a summons from 

the Mad King s daughter  

a foreign invader. 

And here I am  

a Northern fool. 

Children are not their fathers  

luckily for all of us. 

And sometimes there s 

more to foreign invaders 

and Northern fools than meets the eye. 

Daenerys could have sailed for 

Westeros long ago  but she didn t. 

Instead  she stayed where she was 

and saved many people 

from horrible fates  

some of whom are on this 

island with us right now. 

While you re our guest here  

you might consider asking them 

what they think of the 

Mad King s daughter. 

She protects people from monsters  

just as you do. 

It s why she came here. 

And she s not about to head north 

to fight an enemy she s never seen 

on the word of a man she doesn t know. 

After a single meeting  

it s not a reasonable thing to ask. 

So  do you have anything 

reasonable to ask  

What do you mean  

Maybe you are a Northern fool. 

I m asking if there s 

something I can do to help you. 

  Dragonglass  

  Yes. 

Volcanic glass  obsidian. 

He says you have a 

tremendous amount of it here. 

Why are we talking about glass  

We just lost two of our allies. 

Which is why I was speaking 

to Jon Snow  a potential ally. 

And what does the King in the 

North want with dragonglass  

Apparently  it can 

be turned into weapons 

that kill white walkers 

and their foot soldiers. 

Or stop them. 

Destroy them. 

Unsure about the nomenclature. 

And what do you think 

about this Army of the Dead 

and white walkers and Night Kings  

I d very much like to believe 

that Jon Snow is wrong. 

But a wise man once said that 

you should never believe a thing 

simply because you want to believe it. 

Which wise man said this  

I don t remember. 

Are you trying to present your 

own statements as ancient wisdom  

I would never do that. 

To you. 

The reason I believe Jon 

Snow is because he s here. 

All of his advisors would 

have told him not to come. 

I would have told him not to come. 

And he s here anyway. 

You don t have to believe him. 

Let him mine the dragonglass. 

If he s wrong  it s worthless. 

You didn t even know it was here. 

It s nothing to you. 

Give him something 

by giving him nothing. 

Take a step toward a more 

productive relationship 

with a possible ally. 

Keep him occupied while we 

focus on the task at hand... 

Casterly Rock. 

What was that Ser Davos said 

about taking a knife in 

the heart for his people  

Did you notice that  

You must allow them 

their flights of fancy. 

It s dreary in the North. 

Amazing thing to see. 

I named them for my 

brothers  Viserys and Rhaegar. 

They re both gone now. 

You lost two brothers as well. 

People thought dragons were 

gone forever  but here they are. 

Perhaps we should all be 

examining what we think we know. 

You ve been talking to Tyrion. 

He is my Hand. 

  He enjoys talking. 

  We all enjoy what we re good at. 

I don t. 

You know I m not going to let 

Cersei stay on the Iron Throne. 

I never expected that you would. 

And I haven t changed my mind 

about which kingdoms 

belong to that throne. 

I haven t either. 

I will allow you to mine the 

dragonglass and forge weapons from it. 

Any resources or men you 

need  I will provide for you. 

Thank you. 

So you believe me  then  about the 

Night King and the Army of the Dead  

You d better get to work  Jon Snow. 

How much do we have  

  bushels  my lady. 

What does that mean  

For the current occupants of the castle  

it s enough food for 

a year  perhaps more. 

And what s the longest winter 

in the past hundred years  

Uh  I m not entirely certain. 

I I ll check Maester Luwin s records. 

He kept a copy of every raven scroll. 

You re telling me we 

don t have enough food  

especially not if the armies of the 

North come back to defend Winterfell  

No  my lady  most likely not. 

Then we must prepare 

for that eventuality. 

Whatever direction 

the threat comes from  

this is the best place to be. 

We need to start building 

up our grain stores 

with regular shipments from 

every keep in the North. 

If we don t use it by winter s 

end  we ll give it back to them. 

But if the entire North 

has to flee to Winterfell  

they won t have enough time to 

bring wagonloads of grain with them. 

Very wise  my lady. 

Maester Wolkan  you ll see to it  

Are they covering those 

breastplates in leather  

No  my lady. 

Well  shouldn t they be  

Once the real cold comes  

They should  indeed. 

Pardon me  my lady. 

You there  why isn t 

there leather on these  

Command suits you. 

The Northerners are all facing north  

worried about the threat 

from beyond the Wall. 

So they should be. 

I know Cersei better than anyone here. 

If you turn your back on her... 

You don t know Cersei 

better than anyone here. 

I only meant to say... 

That the woman who murdered my mother  

father  and brother is dangerous  

Thank you for your wise counsel. 

One of two things will happen... 

either the dead will defeat the living  

in which case... 

all our troubles come to an end  

or life will win out. 

And what then  

Don t fight in the North or the South. 

Fight every battle  everywhere  

always  in your mind. 

Everyone is your enemy  

everyone is your friend... 

every possible series of 

events is happening all at once. 

Live that way and 

nothing will surprise you. 

Everything that happens 

will be something 

that you ve seen before. 

Lady Sansa  at the gate. 

Hello  Sansa. 

I wish Jon were here. 

Yes  I need to speak to him. 

You re Father s last 

living trueborn son. 

You re Lord of Winterfell now. 

I can never be Lord of Winterfell. 

I can never be lord of anything. 

I m the Three Eyed Raven. 

I don t know what that means. 

It s difficult to explain. 

Try. Please  for me. 

It means I can see everything. 

Everything that s ever 

happened to everyone. 

Everything that s happening right now. 

It s all pieces now  fragments. 

I need to learn to see better. 

When the Long Night comes again  

I need to be ready. 

How do you know all this  

The Three Eyed Raven taught me. 

I thought you were 

the Three Eyed Raven. 

I told you it s difficult to explain. 

Bran... 

I m sorry for all 

that s happened to you. 

I m sorry it had to 

happen here in our home. 

It was so beautiful that night. 

Snow falling  just like now. 

And you were so beautiful... 

in your white wedding dress. 

I have to go back inside  Bran. 

I ll stay a bit longer. 

Hmm. 

Hmm. 

Does it hurt  

A bit. Less than before. 

The infection no longer 

appears to be active. 

Unusual. 

Unlikely. 

One could almost be forgiven 

for thinking that the entire upper 

layer of diseased skin was debrided 

and the underlying region 

treated with some sort of unguent. 

Don t know anything about that. 

I just started feeling better. 

I assumed it was the rest that did it. 

And the climate. 

The climate. 

You re free to go  ser. 

This chamber is needed 

for the infectious  

which you are no longer. 

Tarly  I d like to speak with 

you in my study this evening. 

How bad is it  

Suppose I ll find out this evening. 

Where will you go  

I surrendered to this sickness 

the moment I first saw it. 

I knew it would kill me 

or I d kill myself before it could. 

Daenerys Stormborn 

convinced me otherwise. 

The only place for me is back with her. 

I owe her my life. 

Her and you. 

Your father saved me more than once. 

It s the least I could do. 

Perhaps our paths will cross again. 

I hope they do. 

  You treated him  

  Yes. 

Who told you to treat him  

No one. 

Who forbade you  or anyone  

to attempt to treat him  

I seem to remember you. 

  But you treated him anyway  

  I did  yes. 

I forbade it because it is 

dangerous and rarely successful  

especially on someone of that age. 

You could have infected 

yourself and others. 

You could have devastated 

the entire Citadel. 

But you didn t. 

It s a meticulous  difficult procedure. 

Many maesters whose chains 

are heavy with healing links 

have attempted it and failed. 

Yet you succeeded. 

How  

I read the books and 

followed the instructions. 

That man is alive because of you. 

You should be proud. 

Thank you  Archmaester. 

Come here. 

All these manuscripts and 

scrolls are rotting away. 

I need you to make copies of them. 

You were expecting a reward. 

Your reward is not being immediately 

expelled from the Citadel. 

You d better get started. 

And careful of the paper mites. 

They like flesh as well. 

We need to find Euron 

Greyjoy s fleet and sink it. 

Your Grace  he s already destroyed 

a good portion of our fleet. 

To send our remaining ships after him... 

I m not talking about 

sending our ships after him. 

Would you have to go yourself  

Euron s ships could be anywhere 

or in more than one place. 

You d be flying around 

the open seas alone 

for who knows how long. 

I wouldn t be alone. 

I would have Drogon  

Viserion  and Rhaegal. 

What can anyone do to them  

They can still do something to you. 

It only takes one arrow. 

It s too great a risk. 

You re too important. 

What about Casterly Rock  

The Unsullied will be there soon. 

And what will they face  

A difficult situation. 

They know we re coming. 

Yes. Cersei believes 

my sole purpose in life 

is to destroy House Lannister. 

She will be ready. 

  No one has ever taken the Rock. 

  Archers  

The Lannister Army is still 

the army my father built. 

  Come on  

  Well trained and well provisioned. 

  men at least. 

They will see us coming. 

They will be ready. 

  Draw  Loose  

  Loose  

The gates of Casterly 

Rock are impregnable. 

The fight up the walls will be hard. 

We will be at a disadvantage. 

Many men will die. 

Just as my father said they would. 

Interesting thing about my father... 

he built our house up from near ruin. 

He built our army  he built 

Casterly Rock as we know it  

but he didn t build the sewers. 

That was beneath him  

so he gave the job to the 

lowest person he could find... 

me. 

He was right  I was low. 

The company I kept  low. 

Women  mostly. 

They weren t welcome at the Rock. 

Father disapproved of 

that sort of behavior. 

Couldn t walk them 

through the front gates  

I couldn t have them in my chambers  

so in the process of 

building the sewers  

I threw in something for myself. 

It was a passage that began 

in an out of the way cove by the sea 

and ended beneath one 

of the main guard towers. 

No better place for low 

pursuits than beneath the ground. 

Casterly Rock is an 

impregnable fortress. 

But as a good friend of mine once said  

 Give me  good men and 

I ll impregnate the bitch.  

And so it begins. 

They will face the bulk 

of the Lannister forces. 

They will be outnumbered. 

They will have less 

armor and fewer weapons. 

But my sister s armies 

fight for her out of fear. 

The Unsullied will be 

fighting for something greater. 

They will be fighting for freedom 

and the person who gave it to them. 

They will be fighting for you. 

And that is why they will triumph. 

Where are they   

Where are the rest of the Lannisters  

  It s done. 

  It is. 

And now the rains weep o er our halls. 

Did we fight well  

Uh  as well as could be expected. 

It was never our forte. 

Golden roses  indeed. 

Your brother and his new queen 

thought you would be 

defending Casterly Rock. 

The truth is Casterly Rock 

isn t worth much anymore. 

Well  it is to me  

but my fond childhood memories 

won t keep Cersei on the throne. 

So you just let them take it  

For now. They won t be able to hold it. 

Euron Greyjoy s navy burned their ships  

we emptied the larders before we left. 

Eventually  they ll be forced 

to abandon their position 

and march all the way across Westeros. 

And you took your army  your real army  

and went where they weren t. 

As Robb Stark did to 

me at Whispering Wood. 

There are always lessons in failures. 

Yes. You must be very wise by now. 

My father always said 

I was a slow learner. 

If he was so clever  

why didn t he take Highgarden 

the moment your gold mines ran dry  

I suppose I ll be able to 

ask him myself soon enough. 

No more learning from my mistakes  eh  

How will you do it  

With that sword  

That was Joffrey s sword  wasn t it  

Not that he ever used it. 

What did he call it  

Widow s Wail. 

He really was a cunt  wasn t he  

I did unspeakable things 

to protect my family. 

Or watched them being done on my orders. 

I never lost a night s sleep over them. 

They were necessary. 

And whatever I imagined necessary 

for the safety of House Tyrell  I did. 

But your sister has done things... 

I was incapable of imagining. 

That was my prize mistake... 

a failure of imagination. 

She s a monster  you do know that  

To you  I m sure. 

To others as well. 

But after we ve won and there s 

no one left to oppose us  

when people are living 

peacefully in the world she built  

do you really think they ll wring 

their hands over the way she built it  

You love her. 

You really do love her. 

You poor fool. 

She ll be the end of you. 

Possibly. 

Not much to be gained 

from discussing it with 

you  though  is there  

What better person to discuss it with  

What better guarantee could you have 

that the things you say 

will never leave this room  

But perhaps you re right. 

If she s driven you this far  

it s gone beyond your control. 

Yes. 

It has. 

She s a disease. 

I regret my role in spreading it. 

You will  too. 

I think we re done here. 

How will it happen  

Cersei had several ideas. 

Whipping you through the streets 

and beheading you in 

front of the Red Keep. 

Flaying you alive and hanging you 

from the walls of King s Landing. 

I talked her out of those. 

Will there be pain  

No. I made sure of that. 

That s good. 

I d hate to die like your son. 

Clawing at my neck  

foam and bile spilling from my mouth  

eyes bloodred  skin purple. 

Must have been horrible for you  

as a Kingsguard  as a father. 

It was horrible enough for me. 

A shocking scene. 

Not at all what I intended. 

You see  I had never seen 

the poison work before. 

Tell Cersei. 

I want her to know it was me. 

When I had refused the throne  

Aerys reigned  

whom they called the Mad King. 

You re Aemon Targaryen. 

  What happened to your face  

  Greyscale. 

Everyone advised me to send 

you to the ruins of Valyria  

to live out your short 

life with the Stone Men. 

Two of my sisters had it. They were 

covered with it. They acted like animals. 

Hide  Hide  

Put him in chains. 

You want me alive so you can torture me  

Sansa Stark  

I saw her riding on the East Road 

with Littlefinger. We ll follow them. 

  May I introduce my son  Ramsay Bolton. 

  My Lady. 

Welcome home  Lady Stark. 

The North remembers. 

You let a half wit escape with a cripple  

and Rickon too  the little one. 

I told you what would happen 

if you served me loyally. 

And what would happen if you did not. 

  Who are you  

  Your captor. 

You said you re taking me to the queen. 

Queen Daenerys Targaryen. 

You re the Mother of Dragons. 

Show your strength. 

No one s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I 

know  he s flown halfway across the world. 

The Wise Masters ask for the reopening 

of the fighting pits. 

Where slaves fought slaves to the death  

Opening them would show the people of 

Meereen that you respect their traditions. 

Traditions are the only thing 

that will hold this city together. 

I m so sorry  my queen. 

He was a good man. 

 Barristan the Bold  

they called him. 

He crossed a continent 

to serve me. 

He was a loyal friend. 

And he died in an alley  

butchered by cowards 

who hide behind masks. 

We could pull back 

to the pyramid district  

 i secure it  and use it as a 

base from which to operate.  i  

Then we clean the city out  

 i neighborhood by neighborhood  

street by street   i  

until the rats 

have nowhere left to hide. 

I prefer 

your earlier suggestion. 

Round up the leaders of each of Meereen s 

great families and bring them to me. 

But I m the leader of my family. 

No  Your Grace  

I had nothing to do with this. 

Your Grace  

Don t want to overfeed them. 

Tomorrow perhaps. 

 And though Daenerys maintains 

her grip on Slaver s Bay  

forces rise against her 

from within and without. 

She refuses to leave 

until the freedom 

of the former slaves 

is secure.  

She sounds like quite a woman. 

And she s alone  

under siege  

no family to guide her 

or protect her. 

Her last relation 

thousands of miles away  

useless  dying. 

Don t say that  Maester Aemon. 

A Targaryen alone in the world 

is a terrible thing. 

Maester Aemon. 

Lord Commander. 

Sam  I d like to speak 

to the maester alone. 

How are you feeling  

Oh  like 

a hundred year old man 

slowly freezing to death. 

I need your advice. 

There s something I want 

to do  something I... 

have to do. 

But it ll divide 

the Night s Watch. 

Bitterly. 

Half the men will hate me 

the moment I give the order. 

Half the men hate you 

already  Lord Commander. 

Do it. 

But you don t know what it is. 

That doesn t matter. 

You do. 

You will find little joy 

in your command. 

But with luck  

you will find the strength 

to do what needs to be done. 

Kill the boy  Jon Snow. 

Winter is almost upon us. 

Kill the boy 

and let the man be born. 

Where are the rest 

of the free folk now  

Where have they gone  

Who leads them  

They followed Mance. 

They won t follow anyone else. 

What about you  

Hard to lead 

when you re in chains. 

What if I unchained you  

Why would you do that  

Because you are not my enemy. 

And I m not yours. 

You sure seemed like my enemy 

when you were killing my friends. 

For   years the Night s 

Watch have sworn an oath 

to be the shield that 

guards the realms of men. 

And for   years we ve 

fallen short of that oath. 

You belong to the realms of men. 

All of you. 

And now everything 

is going to change  

  It is. 

  Why now  

Because now I am Lord Commander 

of the Night s Watch. 

What would you have me do  

Lord Commander  

I d have you go 

north of the Wall. 

Gather the remaining free folk wherever 

they are and bring them back here. 

I ll open the gates for 

them and let them through. 

I ll find them lands to 

settle south of the Wall. 

They won t kneel for you 

and neither will I. 

I don t want them 

to kneel for me. 

I want them to fight with 

me when the time comes. 

The day I ask my people 

to fight with the crows 

is the day my people 

cut my guts from my belly 

and make me eat them. 

And how many of your 

people can t fight  

The women  the children  

the old  the sick   

what happens to them  

You re condemning them to death. 

Worse than death because you re 

too proud to make peace. 

Or maybe you re not proud. 

Maybe you re just a coward. 

Easy thing to say 

to a man in chains. 

Your people need a leader. 

And they need to get south of 

the Wall before it s too late. 

We don t have much time 

and they have less. 

The walkers are coming and 

they ll hit your people first. 

I m not asking you to make 

peace to save your skin. 

Make peace to save your people. 

Most of them are at Hardhome. 

You know where that is  

Up on Storrold s Point. 

I can give you  horses 

and nine other men. 

You can get there in a week. 

We ll need ships. 

I ll talk to King Stannis 

about lending you his fleet. 

All right  then. 

You re coming with me. 

 i You re the Lord Commander  i  

 i of the Night s Watch.  i  

They need to hear it from you. 

They need to know 

the ships they are boarding 

won t be torched 

in the middle of the sea. 

You come with me or I don t go. 

You d bring wildlings here 

through our gates  

Men  women  and children will die 

by the thousands if we do nothing. 

Let them die. We got our 

own to worry about. 

Less enemies for us. 

Fewer. 

  What  

  Nothing. 

Look  well  there is 

good farmland in the Gift. 

Land that no one uses now. 

A dozen abandoned villages. 

And why do you think the farmers 

abandoned those villages  

 i Because the wildlings  i  

 i raided them for years.  i  

Cut them down  

Just like they did this boy s people. 

Aye  

 i We ve been fighting 

them for thousands of years.  i  

They ve slaughtered villages. 

 i They ve slaughtered  i  

 i our brothers.  i  

And we ve slaughtered theirs. 

I will follow you 

anywhere  you know that. 

  But they killed Grenn. 

  Yes. 

  And they killed Pyp. 

  Aye. 

 i They killed  of our brothers.  i  

 i I can t forget that.  i  

I can t forgive it. 

You were at the Fist 

of the First Men. 

If we abandon them  

you know what they become. 

 i We can learn to live  i  

 i with the wildlings  i  

 i or we can add them  i  

 i to the army of the dead.  i  

Whatever they are now  

they re better than that. 

Thank you. 

 i Olly.  i  

 i If you have something  i  

 i you want to say to me   i  

 i say it.  i  

It s all right. 

You don t mean it  do you  

Telling the wildlings 

you want to make peace. 

You re just doing it 

to trick them. 

It s not a trick. 

They burned my village. 

They put an arrow 

through my father s head 

right in front of me. 

They butchered my mother  

everyone I ever knew. 

I know what it s like 

to lose the people you love. 

I know this is hard for you. 

But winter is coming. 

We know what s coming with it. 

We can t face it alone. 

Will there be anything else 

you need  Lord Commander  

No. 

She s far away 

from the Lannisters. 

 i This is her home.  i  

Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here. 

Better off with the Boltons 

who murdered 

her mother and brother  

Sansa s in danger even 

if she doesn t realize it. 

Thank you. 

You ve lived here a long time  

Aye. 

Did you know Lord Eddard  

I knew him 

and his father before him. 

The Starks are gone now. 

Not all of them. 

 i I know who s inside that castle.  i  

Everyone knows. 

The Boltons. 

I m not talking 

about the Boltons. 

I need to get a message to her. 

To Sansa Stark. 

Who are you  

Someone who swore 

to keep her safe. 

Swore to who  

Her mother. 

Her mother s dead. 

That doesn t release me 

from an oath. 

I served Lady Catelyn. 

I serve her still. 

Who do you serve  

 i Come back here.  i  

Myranda. 

I saw you staring at her. 

I m going to marry her. 

That will involve looking 

at her from time to time. 

You said you d marry me. 

And I meant it. 

When I was a bastard named Snow. 

 i But I m a Bolton now.  i  

What I want is no longer 

the primary consideration. 

I m furthering a dynasty. 

Do you think she s pretty  

Of course I do. 

I m not blind. 

You think she s pretty  too. 

I m looking forward 

to our wedding night. 

But don t worry  I ll have 

plenty of time for you. 

Perhaps I ll marry  too. 

You re the kennel 

master s daughter. 

Who are you going to marry  

the stable keeper s son  

You re mine. 

You re not going anywhere. 

Unless I have to listen 

to more of your jealousy. 

Jealousy bores me. You remember 

what happens to people who bore me. 

You re not going to bore 

me  are you  Myranda  

Never. 

Beg pardon  my lady. 

I ve come to refill 

the wash basin. 

Oh  I don t need   

You still have 

friends in the North. 

If you re ever in trouble  

light a candle in the highest 

window of the broken tower. 

  But who   

  You re not alone. 

I like your dress. 

Who made it for you  

I made it myself. 

Really  

Who   who are you  

I m Myranda  the kennel 

master s daughter. 

May I  

Oh  wonderful. 

The stitching. 

  Who taught you  

  My mother. 

I m sorry for what 

happened to her. 

Thank you. 

It s good that she taught you. 

It was a gift. 

Now every time you wear 

something you made  

you can remember her. 

I d rather have a mother. 

I know. 

It s not the same. 

Still  it s good to remember. 

Remember the way things were. 

I almost forgot. 

There s something else 

 i to help you remember.  i  

Down there at the end. 

What is it  

That would spoil the surprise. 

Go ahead  it s perfectly safe. 

You won t believe it 

when you see it. 

Theon  

You shouldn t be here. 

You smell particularly 

ripe this evening. 

Pour me some wine. 

Do you have 

something to tell me  

No  my lord. 

Reek. 

She saw me. 

Who  

Sansa. 

Lady Sansa. 

She came to the kennels. 

She saw you  

Yes. 

I m sorry  master. 

Forgive me. 

I didn t think   

Come here. 

You mustn t keep 

secrets from me  Reek. 

Get on your knees. 

Give me your hand. 

I forgive you. 

I trust you find your 

chamber suitable  my lady. 

Yes  thank you  my lord. 

Allow me. 

Mother. 

Thank you  Ramsay. 

My lady  we are all a 

family  we northerners. 

Our blood ties go back 

thousands of years. 

So I d like to drink 

to our wedding. 

May our happiness 

spread from Moat Cailin 

to the Last Hearth. 

To your wedding. 

To your wedding. 

It must be difficult for you 

being in a strange place. 

This isn t a strange place. 

This is my home. 

It s the people who are strange. 

You re right. 

Very strange. 

More wine  please. 

 i I heard you two had reunited.  i  

A fitting place for it. 

I like to imagine that 

the last time you spoke 

was in this very room. 

 i Are you still angry with him  i  

 i after he...  i  

what he did  

Don t worry. 

The North remembers. 

I punished him for it. 

He s not ironborn anymore. 

Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. 

He s a new man. 

A new person  anyway. 

Aren t you  Reek  

Yes  master. 

That s his 

new name   Reek. 

Why are you doing this  

Because Reek has 

something to say to you. 

Don t you  Reek  

An apology. 

Apologize to Lady Sansa 

for what you did. 

Apologize for murdering 

her two brothers. 

I m sorry. 

Look at her  Reek. 

 i An apology doesn t mean anything  i  

 i if you re not looking  i  

 i the person in the eye.  i  

  I m sorry. 

 i   Sorry about what   i  

For killing your brothers. 

There  over and done with. 

 i Doesn t everyone  i  

 i feel better  I do.  i  

That was getting very tense. 

Whew. 

You know what  my lady  

What with him having 

murdered your brothers 

and the rest 

of your family gone... 

Reek here is the nearest 

thing to living kin 

that you have left. 

Reek. 

You will give away the bride. 

Someone has to. 

What better person  

Good  Good  

Yes  yes  very good. 

Wonderful. 

Walda and I have 

some good news as well  

since we re all together. 

We re going to have a baby. 

I m very happy for you. 

From the way she s carrying  

Maester Wolkan says 

it looks like a boy. 

 i How can you be sure   i  

Sure of what  

That she s pregnant. 

I mean... 

how can you tell  

Maester Wolkan has assured 

us beyond all doubt. 

So how did you manage it  

Manage what  

Getting her pregnant. 

I imagine you re familiar 

with the procedure. 

Of course  but how did you... 

find it  

You disgraced yourself at dinner 

parading that creature 

before the Stark girl. 

And if it s a boy  

You re worried about 

your position. 

My position is quite clear. 

I m your son 

until a better 

alternative comes along. 

You ve never asked me 

about your mother. 

Why would I  

She had me  she died. 

And here we are. 

She was a peasant girl. 

Pretty in a common sort of way. 

She was the miller s wife. 

Apparently they had married 

without my knowledge or consent. 

So I had him hanged 

and I took her beneath the 

tree where he was swaying. 

She fought me the whole time. 

She was lucky 

I didn t hang her  too. 

 i A year later  i  

 i she came to my gates  i  

 i with a squalling baby  i  

 i in her arms.  i  

 i A baby she claimed was mine.  i  

I nearly had her whipped 

and the child 

thrown in the river. 

But then I looked at you 

 i and I saw then what I see now.  i  

You are my son. 

Stannis Baratheon has 

an army at Castle Black. 

But he won t stay for long. 

He wants the Iron Throne  

and the road to King s Landing 

comes right through Winterfell. 

He means to take the North. 

But the North is ours. 

It s yours and mine. 

Will you help me defeat him  

Yes. 

Is this every book there is  

Every book there is  

  In the world. 

  Well  no. 

There are thousands and 

thousands of books out there. 

This library is rather 

small  actually. 

Where you grew up  

were there more books  

My father s not 

the most literate man. 

They say the Citadel has the 

largest library in the world. 

Where s that  

The Citadel  

In Oldtown. 

I m sorry I don t know things. 

Gilly  look at me. 

 i You know how to do a hundred 

things I can never do.  i  

You can build a fire 

with wet wood. 

You can cook. 

You can stitch a wound. 

I can wash the linens. 

I can sweep the floor. 

  Well...   Why does the Citadel have 

the biggest library  

 i It s where they train  i  

 i the maesters.  i  

Like Maester Aemon  

I wanted to be one 

when I was young. 

Instead  I became a man 

of the Night s Watch. 

Far more adventure 

up here anyway. 

I wouldn t have met you. 

Ah  Your Grace. 

You re Samwell Tarly  

I am  Your Grace. 

Your father is Randyll Tarly. 

He defeated my brother 

at the Battle of Ashford. 

 i Only battle Robert ever lost.  i  

I told him he shouldn t go so far 

west so soon  but he never listened. 

 i Fine soldier  your father.  i  

You don t look like a soldier. 

But I m told you killed 

a white walker. 

I did  Your Grace. 

 i How   i  

With a dagger 

made of dragonglass. 

Dragonglass  

What the maesters call obsidian. 

I know what it is. 

We have it in Dragonstone. 

Why would obsidian 

kill a walker  

I don t know. 

I ve been going through 

all the old manuscripts 

hoping to find something  

and all I ve learned 

is that the children of the forest 

used to hunt with dragonglass. 

The Lady Melisandre told me 

that death marches on the Wall. 

I ve seen it  Your Grace. 

Seen what  

The army of the dead. 

  And when they come   

  We have to know how to fight them. 

Keep reading  Samwell Tarly. 

It s time. 

Uh  Your Grace. 

Wouldn t it be better to wait  

When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings  

we could have thousands more men. 

If Jon Snow returns 

with the wildlings. 

We can t wait that long. 

We have the advantage   more men  

more horses  all fed and rested. 

 i But every day we wait  the 

odds shift in Bolton s favor.  i  

This could turn to winter 

at any moment. 

We have to act now. 

Give the order. 

We march at sunrise. 

I ll choose a dozen men to stay 

and guard the queen 

and the princess. 

No need. 

They re coming with us. 

It s a tough road ahead  

Your Grace. 

  Won t they be safer   

  Here  

Half these watchmen 

are killers and rapists. 

No  they march with us. 

As you wish  Your Grace. 

 i Do you think Father will 

let me go down into the crypt   i  

Beg your pardon  

At Winterfell. 

All the Kings in the North 

are buried there. 

Bran the Builder 

and King Dorren and   

First things first. 

It s a long march ahead. 

And then we have 

to take the castle. 

Is there going to be a battle  

Aye  princess  but you 

won t be anywhere near   

That s enough talk 

of battle  Ser Davos. 

You ll scare the child. 

 i Yes  my queen.  i  

  I m not scared. 

  Well  I am. 

When the battle comes  

promise you ll protect me. 

I promise. 

I hope you know what you re 

doing with these wildlings. 

I need those ships. 

You ll get them back  

I swear it. 

Have a safe journey  Your Grace. 

And thank you. 

 i Mount up   i  

 i Colors   i  

No. 

You re still too weak. 

Ser Barristan  

 i Are you ashamed   i  

 i You were ambushed  outnumbered.  i  

 i There was no way  i  

 i you could have known.  i  

This is not why. 

Wounded in war  

there is no shame for this. 

I am ashamed 

because when the knife go in 

and I fall to the ground  

I am afraid. 

All men fear death. 

No  not death. 

I fear 

I never again see Missandei 

from the Island of Naath. 

Now you have given the 

Masters what they deserve. 

If I give everyone 

what they deserve  

I ll have no one left to rule. 

Ser Barristan counseled mercy 

when I took this city right 

up to the morning he died. 

 i Daario Naharis thinks I should 

kill the former Masters  i  

 i and let the rest of the 

city fend for itself.  i  

What do you think  

Your Grace  I think 

that I am not fit 

to have an opinion 

on these matters. 

You are as fit as anyone I know. 

You know why I m here. 

And you know who will suffer the 

most if this all falls apart. 

 i So what do you think   i  

I can only tell you 

what I have seen  Your Grace. 

I have seen you listen 

to your counselors. 

I have seen you lean on their 

experience when your own was lacking 

and weigh the choices 

they put before you. 

And I have seen you 

ignore your counselors... 

because there was 

a better choice. 

One that only you could see. 

My   my queen  

please do not do this. 

 i What about  valar morghulis    i  

I did not want to die a coward. 

Apparently I do not 

want to die at all. 

It takes courage to admit fear. 

And to admit a mistake. 

I came here to tell you 

that I was wrong. 

I was wrong and you were right. 

About tradition. 

About bringing the people 

of this city together. 

I will reopen the fighting pits. 

To free men only. 

Slavery will never return to 

Meereen  not while I live. 

Yes  my queen. 

And in order to forge a lasting 

bond with the Meereenese people  

I will marry the leader 

of an ancient family. 

Thankfully a suitor 

is already on his knees. 

Don t worry. 

I ll be fine. Nothing 

broken  I don t think. 

Where are we now  

Not the Rhoyne. 

Long  sullen silences 

and an occasional 

punch in the face. 

The Mormont way. 

Let s start over. 

I apologize for before. 

 i My mouth sometimes  i  

 i runs away from me.  i  

This doesn t have to be 

an unpleasant trip. 

We re going to be spending a lot of 

time together on the way to Meereen. 

We are. 

What would make our time 

together truly enjoyable 

would be some wine. 

No wine. 

I am a person who drinks. 

People who drink 

need to keep drinking. 

 i Otherwise  they re not...  i  

I know where we are. 

You re taking us 

through Valyria. 

I am. 

Have you sailed 

this route before  

No. 

You re going to bring 

Daenerys a souvenir 

from her ancestral homeland 

in case I m not enough  

I think you ll be plenty. 

 i You know what they say.  i  

The Doom still rules Valyria. 

What about the demons 

and the flames  

 i Aren t you afraid of the Doom   i  

 i No.  i  

But pirates are. 

Oh. 

The Smoking Sea. 

How many centuries 

before we learn 

how to build cities 

like this again  

Thousands of years the Valyrians were 

the best in the world 

at almost everything. 

And then... 

And then they weren t. 

And then they weren t. 

 They held each other close and 

turned their backs upon the end. 

 i The hills that split asunder  i  

and the black 

that ate the skies  

The flames that shot 

so high and hot 

that even dragons burned  

Would never be the final sights 

that fell upon their eyes. 

A fly upon a wall  

the waves the sea wind 

whipped and churned    

 The city of a thousand years  

and all that men had learned  

The Doom consumed it all alike  

and neither 

of them turned.  

I would clap. 

I suppose this is it  then. 

This is what remains. 

What was that  

Stone Men  

Don t let them touch you  

Get behind  

Mormont  cut me free  

Mormont  

Mormont  

Mormont  

Tyrion  

Tyrion. 

Tyrion. 

Tyrion. 

You re all right. 

You re heavier than you look. 

Did any of them touch you  

You  

I ve seen greyscale before  

but nothing like that. 

I suppose that s why 

they send them there. 

It d be kinder to put daggers in 

their hearts and be done with it. 

Thank you for saving me. 

Of course  I wouldn t 

have needed saving 

if you hadn t kidnapped me 

in the first place. 

So what now  

We walk up the coast. 

With luck  we ll find 

a fishing village. 

Maybe another boat. 

Without luck  

We ve got a long walk 

ahead of us. 

I ll get some wood for a fire. 

Try to get some rest  huh  

That s the best idea 

you ve had all day.
