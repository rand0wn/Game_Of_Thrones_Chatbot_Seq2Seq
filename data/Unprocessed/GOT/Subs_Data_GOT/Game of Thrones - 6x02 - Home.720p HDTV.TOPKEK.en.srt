1
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,114
Give him another go, Ned.

2
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,116
That's my father.

3
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,450
And my Uncle Benjen.

4
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,620
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

5
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:02,128
They were all so happy.

6
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,213
So were you once.

7
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:13,770
Stop showing off.

8
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:15,438
Lyanna!

9
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:17,223
My Aunt Lyanna.

10
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:19,725
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

11
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,227
My father never talked about her.

12
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,817
<i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

13
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:36,070
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

14
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,238
<i>I don't know.</i>

15
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,906
What about him?

16
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:42,542
Wylis, come here.

17
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:49,798
Hodor?

18
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,883
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

19
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:55,502
And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

20
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:58,221
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

21
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,090
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

22
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,258
Hodor talks?

23
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,481
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

24
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,017
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

25
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:16,652
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

26
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,021
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

27
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:22,106
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

28
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,024
So leave him be.

29
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:26,410
It is time to go.

30
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,527
Please, a little longer.

31
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,290
You finally show me
something I care about

32
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,874
and then you drag me away.

33
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,678
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

34
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:52,046
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

35
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:56,216
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

36
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:11,561
Wylis.

37
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:13,312
Hodor.

38
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,114
I saw you as a boy.

39
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,066
You could talk.

40
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,735
What happened?

41
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,703
Hodor.

42
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,658
Where's Meera?

43
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,794
Hodor.

44
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,598
You shouldn't be here.

45
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:03,401
It's not safe outside the cave.

46
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,185
It's not safe anywhere.

47
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,907
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

48
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:13,109
<i>- Hodor.
- His real name is Wylis.</i>

49
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:17,329
And he could talk and
fight and-- and then--

50
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:19,663
What's wrong?

51
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:25,785
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

52
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,086
And we're going to fight it in there?

53
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,644
Brandon Stark needs you.

54
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,698
For what?
I sit in there

55
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:07,116
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

56
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:09,786
He isn't going to stay here forever.

57
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:13,322
And out there he needs you.

58
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,977
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

59
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,396
Open the door and the men inside

60
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,764
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

61
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:56,822
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

62
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,443
Nobody needs to die tonight.

63
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:08,497
I've never been much of a fighter.

64
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:17,838
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

65
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,845
Come on.

66
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:15,082
Attack!

67
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,140
Fight, you cowards!

68
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,450
You fucking traitor.

69
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,617
The only traitors here are the ones

70
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,704
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

71
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,290
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

72
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,008
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

73
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,127
Until you.

74
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,137
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

75
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:01,247
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

76
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:07,002
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

77
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:09,804
Bodies to burn.

78
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,812
<i> Shh, hey.</i>

79
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:24,432
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

80
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,683
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

81
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,769
All of a sudden she looks my way.

82
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,739
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

83
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:35,273
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

84
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,026
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

85
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,028
She's never seen anything like it.

86
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,496
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

87
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:45,782
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

88
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,616
Ooh!

89
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,669
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

90
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,372
Well, you all know me.

91
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,506
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

92
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,818
Get out of my way.

93
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,903
King's orders, Your Grace.

94
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,740
What are the king's orders?

95
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,609
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

96
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:26,993
for your own protection.

97
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,614
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

98
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:35,750
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

99
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,419
I would like to speak to my son.

100
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,954
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

101
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,396
She grew up.

102
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:16,481
<i>Almost.</i>

103
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:19,234
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

104
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,737
I expect it was Mother.

105
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,821
Your mother wouldn't do that.

106
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,240
Yes, she would.

107
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,410
Are you angry with her?

108
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,412
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

109
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:38,214
She has every right to be here.

110
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,834
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

111
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,721
If she had tried--

112
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,730
They're not putting
your mother in a cell ever again.

113
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,223
Not while I'm here.

114
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,227
Why haven't you gone to see her?

115
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,265
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

116
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,734
Don't you think I know that?

117
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,488
I'm sorry.

118
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,325
But I can't.

119
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,775
Why not?

120
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:18,779
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

121
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,748
what did I do?

122
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:26,035
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

123
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,920
what did I do?

124
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,372
We all fail sometimes.

125
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:34,875
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

126
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,428
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

127
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,212
what good am I?

128
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:43,382
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

129
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:48,052
Your Grace.

130
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,853
Lord Commander.

131
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:52,688
I want to see my wife.

132
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:55,107
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

133
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:58,610
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

134
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,645
The king must wait as well.

135
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:04,198
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

136
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,574
You're a bold man.

137
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,793
On the contrary.

138
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,495
I fear a great deal.

139
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,748
The Father, the Mother,

140
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,999
the Warrior.

141
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:41,142
Do you know why we use these stones?

142
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:45,729
To remind us not to fear death.

143
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:49,099
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

144
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,434
You must long for the next life.

145
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:54,936
In truth, I fear that, too.

146
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:57,990
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

147
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:00,741
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

148
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,610
and atoned for her sin.

149
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,911
What about my sins?

150
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:10,699
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

151
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:15,003
I killed my own cousin.

152
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,037
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

153
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,456
I helped him escape their justice.

154
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,709
What atonement do I deserve?

155
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:28,346
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

156
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,881
Oh, the gods won't mind.

157
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,433
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

158
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,553
Go on, then.

159
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,273
I deserve it.
We all do.

160
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,974
We are weak, vain creatures.

161
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,943
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

162
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:05,241
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

163
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,209
I don't.

164
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:10,211
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

165
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,996
I've fought against worse odds.

166
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:15,049
No doubt many of us would fall.

167
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,167
But who are we, hmm?

168
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:20,970
We have no names, no family.

169
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,973
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

170
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,475
And yet together,

171
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,227
we can overthrow an empire.

172
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:02,118
<i>Mother.</i>

173
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:16,513
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

174
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,715
Gold.

175
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,301
Good. It was always her color.

176
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:27,854
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

177
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:32,608
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>

178
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:38,446
I didn't want to lose you again.

179
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,365
I understand.

180
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,368
I'm glad to see you.

181
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:50,071
I know I should have come sooner.

182
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:53,542
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

183
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:56,827
It's all right.

184
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,831
No, it isn't.

185
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,251
I should have executed all of them.

186
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,169
I should have pulled down the sept

187
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:12,339
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

188
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:14,758
as you would have for me.

189
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:18,427
You raised me to be strong...

190
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,180
and I wasn't.

191
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,649
But I want to be.

192
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,069
Help me.

193
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,107
Always.

194
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,015
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

195
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,469
Meaning no offense.

196
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,389
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

197
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,772
I do not make dwarf jokes.

198
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,975
You think them.

199
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,478
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

200
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:28,398
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

201
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,949
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

202
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:34,119
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

203
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,821
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

204
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:39,406
The Masters have retaken both cities.

205
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:44,159
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

206
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,215
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

207
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,050
They are not eating.

208
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,918
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

209
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:57,720
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

210
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,673
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

211
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:04,092
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

212
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:06,477
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

213
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,929
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

214
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,981
I drink and I know things.

215
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,185
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

216
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:19,770
ranged over hundreds of miles.

217
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,656
Then Daenerys's ancestors

218
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,574
started chaining them up in pens.

219
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,660
A few generations later,

220
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,412
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

221
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:33,448
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

222
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:37,000
Missandei,

223
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:40,620
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

224
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:44,373
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

225
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,508
Never.

226
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:48,760
Dragons are intelligent.

227
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,712
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

228
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:54,130
They have affection for their friends

229
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:56,049
and fury for their enemies.

230
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:00,218
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

231
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:03,387
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

232
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,676
I'm friends with your mother.

233
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,134
I'm here to help.

234
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,301
Don't eat the help.

235
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:54,473
When I was a child,

236
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:58,226
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

237
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:00,944
I begged him for one of you.

238
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,531
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

239
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:08,618
"It could be little
like me."

240
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:19,459
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

241
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:22,995
Then my father told me

242
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,999
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

243
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,218
I cried myself to sleep that night.

244
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,226
But here you are.

245
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,363
Next time I have an idea like that,

246
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:53,232
punch me in the face.

247
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:09,077
What's your name?

248
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,583
What's your name?

249
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,086
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

250
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:23,922
You don't believe that.

251
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:57,331
Who are you?

252
00:27:58,951 --> 00:27:59,951
No one.

253
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:02,451
If a girl says her name,

254
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:05,587
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

255
00:28:05,672 --> 00:28:07,956
A girl has no name.

256
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:10,291
If a girl says her name,

257
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:12,459
a man will feed her tonight.

258
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:15,011
A girl has no name.

259
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,096
If a girl says her name,

260
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:20,516
a man will give her eyes back.

261
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,519
A girl has no name.

262
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:34,226
Come.

263
00:28:42,568 --> 00:28:44,483
Leave it.

264
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,653
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

265
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,912
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

266
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:03,498
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

267
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:05,300
They obviously had help.

268
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:08,302
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

269
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:11,838
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

270
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,341
We know where she's going.

271
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:16,175
Her brother's at Castle Black.

272
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,977
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

273
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:20,144
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

274
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,314
So was I, Father.

275
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,482
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

276
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:27,851
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

277
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:30,519
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

278
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:34,522
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

279
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:38,525
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow--

280
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:41,578
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

281
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,364
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

282
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,116
We don't need
every house in the North.

283
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:50,835
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

284
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,788
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

285
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,841
With their support,
none could challenge us.

286
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:01,927
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

287
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:05,013
It's time for new blood in the North.

288
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:16,805
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

289
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,723
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

290
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:21,692
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

291
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,945
<i>My lords.</i>

292
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:27,397
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

293
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:29,482
A boy.

294
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,067
<i>Red-cheeked
and healthy.</i>

295
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:35,403
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

296
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:46,495
Congratulations, Father.

297
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:50,748
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

298
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,637
You'll always be my firstborn.

299
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,389
Thank you for saying that.

300
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:03,725
It means a great deal to me.

301
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:42,455
Maester Wolkan,

302
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,424
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

303
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:50,260
Poisoned by our enemies.

304
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,633
How did he die?

305
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:04,972
Poisoned by his enemies.

306
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:07,974
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

307
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:11,226
Forgive me, my lord.

308
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,447
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

309
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:20,033
She's resting, my lord.

310
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,454
At once, my lord.

311
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:52,308
There he is.

312
00:32:52,394 --> 00:32:54,344
Isn't he wonderful?

313
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,814
May I hold him?

314
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:03,233
Of-- of course.

315
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:15,243
Little brother.

316
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,278
Lord Bolton sent for us.

317
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,030
Have you seen him?

318
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,789
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

319
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:51,221
Where is Lord Bolton?

320
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:03,230
Down!

321
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:06,232
<i> It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

322
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:09,785
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

323
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:19,042
Ramsay, where is your father?

324
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:22,045
Ramsay.

325
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:32,052
Where is Lord Bolton?

326
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:40,642
I am Lord Bolton.

327
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:52,652
Ramsay.

328
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,436
Ramsay, please.

329
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,155
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

330
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:04,527
Please.

331
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:06,612
Ramsay.

332
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:10,331
He's your brother.

333
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:15,785
I prefer being an only child.

334
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:38,970
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

335
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:40,939
I don't think he hurt her.

336
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:44,141
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

337
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:48,111
You don't know which way she went?

338
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,479
I spent three days looking for her.

339
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,030
She disappeared.

340
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,867
How'd she look?

341
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:58,152
She looked good.

342
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:01,204
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

343
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,240
No, she wouldn't be.

344
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,326
What happened at Winterfell?

345
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:23,588
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

346
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:26,640
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

347
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:34,396
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

348
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:56,163
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

349
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,331
It's not safe.

350
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,749
He won't stop hunting us.

351
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,533
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

352
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,085
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

353
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:06,037
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

354
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,789
I won't let him.

355
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:09,873
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

356
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:14,877
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

357
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,680
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

358
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,684
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

359
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:28,138
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

360
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:30,056
I don't want to be forgiven.

361
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I can never make
amends to your family

362
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,144
for the things I've done.

363
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,530
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

364
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:47,870
You're not coming with us?

365
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,324
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

366
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,410
I would have died to get you there.

367
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,641
May I take one of the horses?

368
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,396
Where will you go?

369
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,066
Home.

370
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:38,776
<i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

371
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:41,110
And the ironborn who held it?

372
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:44,447
They died fighting to a man.

373
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,250
What is dead may never die.

374
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:50,534
What is dead may never die.

375
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
But they did

376
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:55,422
and our invasion died with them.

377
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,624
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

378
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,376
Then we will take more.

379
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:03,711
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

380
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:08,298
Because I order it.

381
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,434
We can defeat anyone at sea,

382
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,718
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

383
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:14,303
against mainland armies.

384
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,638
Not if our captains defy my orders,

385
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:21,191
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

386
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,277
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

387
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,478
Then where is he?

388
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:27,030
Where is your kingdom?

389
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:31,149
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

390
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,318
That war is over.

391
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,152
The last time
we provoked them too far,

392
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:37,954
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

393
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,989
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

394
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,908
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

395
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,626
And I lost three sons.

396
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,912
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

397
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:49,914
Well, the other four are dead.

398
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:53,250
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

399
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:55,168
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

400
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:57,970
or I will make another heir who will.

401
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:38,585
Let me pass.

402
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,372
You fool, move aside for your king.

403
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:47,342
Haven't I always, brother?

404
00:40:57,184 --> 00:41:01,552
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

405
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:05,022
What is dead may never die.

406
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:10,192
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

407
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:12,528
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

408
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:15,696
You can mock our god without my help.

409
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:18,566
I don't mock the Drowned God.

410
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,535
I am the Drowned God.

411
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,486
From Oldtown to Qarth,

412
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:27,156
when men see my sails, they pray.

413
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:39,465
You're old, brother.

414
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,416
<i>You've had your time.</i>

415
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,802
Now let another rule.

416
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:47,087
I heard you lost your mind

417
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:50,256
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

418
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:55,727
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

419
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,346
They did.

420
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:02,016
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

421
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:04,017
I needed silence.

422
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,570
What kind of an ironborn

423
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:11,573
loses his senses during a storm?

424
00:42:11,658 --> 00:42:15,527
I am the storm, brother.

425
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:17,911
The first storm and the last.

426
00:42:19,415 --> 00:42:21,447
And you're in my way.

427
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:03,947
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

428
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:07,366
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

429
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,484
Pull his bones down to your depths

430
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,370
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

431
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,788
What is dead may never die.

432
00:43:23,964 --> 00:43:26,497
I'm going to find out who did this.

433
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:29,667
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

434
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:34,137
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

435
00:43:34,223 --> 00:43:37,056
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

436
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:39,224
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

437
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:41,175
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

438
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:44,561
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

439
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:49,015
Perhaps you'll win.

440
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,317
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

441
00:43:53,604 --> 00:43:55,353
And perhaps not.

442
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:13,951
Come in.

443
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,708
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

444
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:25,927
You interrupt nothing.

445
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:40,771
I assume you know why I'm here.

446
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,557
I will after you tell me.

447
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:45,892
It's about the Lord Commander.

448
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:48,144
The former Lord Commander.

449
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,280
Does he have to be?

450
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,984
What are you asking?

451
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,707
Do you know of any magic...

452
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,042
that could help him?

453
00:45:08,128 --> 00:45:09,494
Bring him back?

454
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,212
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

455
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:14,464
Can it be done?

456
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,133
There are some with this power.

457
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,802
<i>- How?
- I don't know.</i>

458
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:20,969
Have you seen it done?

459
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,674
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

460
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:29,892
but the priest
who did it--

461
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,894
it shouldn't have been possible.

462
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,147
But it was.
It could be now.

463
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,565
Not for me.

464
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,770
Not for you?

465
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:51,109
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

466
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:54,278
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

467
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:56,997
Everything I believed,

468
00:45:57,116 --> 00:46:00,533
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

469
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:02,201
all of it was a lie.

470
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,539
You were right all along.

471
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:11,375
The Lord never spoke to me.

472
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,426
Fuck him, then.

473
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:15,428
Fuck all of them.

474
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:20,849
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

475
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:24,301
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

476
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:30,140
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

477
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:34,776
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

478
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,945
I never had this gift.

479
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,981
Have you ever tried?

480
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,455
Please.

481
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:30,600
