1
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,664
I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

2
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,616
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

3
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,501
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>what am I grateful for?</i>

4
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:41,319
The opportunity to live
and die at the Wall

5
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,321
as punishment for a crime
I did not commit?

6
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,540
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

7
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,293
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

8
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,013
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

9
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,717
I couldn't--

10
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,669
I couldn't listen to her

11
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,105
standing there
telling her lies.

12
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,506
I couldn't do it.

13
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,109
You fell in love
with a whore.

14
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,194
Yes, I fell in love
with a whore.

15
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:09,982
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

16
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,371
That deal you made,

17
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:19,190
it was everything
Father wanted.

18
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,525
<i>You do see that?</i>

19
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,411
<i>He gets you back</i>
<i>as his heir.</i>

20
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,663
<i>The future</i>
<i>Lord of the Rock.</i>

21
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,332
And he ships me off
to Castle Black,

22
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,167
out of sight at last.

23
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,671
All so perfect.

24
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,142
It felt good
to take that from him.

25
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,564
He knows I'm innocent and he's
willing to sacrifice me anyway.

26
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,549
He's willing
to sacrifice any of us.

27
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,318
Not you.

28
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,487
You're the golden son.

29
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,856
You could kill a king,
lose a hand,

30
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,108
fuck your own sister, you'll
always be the golden son.

31
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,593
Careful.

32
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,995
I'm the last friend
you've got.

33
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,036
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

34
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,204
Yes, brilliant speech.

35
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,573
They'll be talking
about it for days to come.

36
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,009
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>a realist.</i>

37
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,679
Didn't realize
you'd die for pride.

38
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,431
Don't give up on me
just yet.

39
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:19,017
I survived one
trial by combat,

40
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,103
even though you weren't
there to save me.

41
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,605
I can't save you
this time either.

42
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,309
<i>My training has proved</i>

43
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,195
that I can't beat a stable
boy with my left hand.

44
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,315
Where's your sense
of adventure?

45
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,568
Even if you lose,
imagine the look

46
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,869
on Father's face
when you fall.

47
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,238
Our family name snuffed out

48
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,008
with a single swing
of the sword.

49
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,626
It is tempting.

50
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,344
Well...

51
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,297
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

52
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,767
If he wins,

53
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,819
I expect I'll be
in his debt

54
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,687
for the rest
of my life.

55
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,406
If he wins.

56
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,824
Will you find him for me?

57
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:21,813
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

58
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,583
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

59
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,086
I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel
that pompous child beater.

60
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,988
No.

61
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,541
Not Ser Meryn.

62
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,286
<i>Go on, move it.</i>

63
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,688
And you.

64
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,557
Come on.

65
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,735
Mercy.

66
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,370
Please.

67
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:04,322
Please, mercy.

68
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:17,752
Ser Gregor.
Welcome to the capital.

69
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,640
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

70
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,596
You seem to be
in good form.

71
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,598
Who am I fighting?

72
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,817
Does it matter?

73
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,092
Could be food.

74
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:59,177
Could be soldiers.

75
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,238
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

76
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,657
Where else to sit?

77
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,493
Tried to walk back
to my hut,

78
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,012
hurt too much.

79
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,432
Then I remembered
they burned my hut down.

80
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,551
Who were "they"?

81
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,120
I stopped asking
a while ago.

82
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,843
That's not gonna
get better.

83
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,145
Doesn't seem so.

84
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,230
A bad way to go.

85
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,800
Haven't you had enough?

86
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,569
Of what?

87
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,607
I know.

88
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,876
Time to go.

89
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,746
Take matters into
my own hands.

90
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,534
The thought
has occurred to me.

91
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,039
So why go on?

92
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,926
Habit.

93
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,547
Nothing could
be worse than this.

94
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,134
Maybe nothing is
worse than this.

95
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,889
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

96
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,778
Nothing is just nothing.

97
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,151
Who are you?

98
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,405
My name is Arya.

99
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,707
Arya Stark.

100
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,996
You her father?

101
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,831
Her captor.

102
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,968
Bringing her to her aunt
for ransom.

103
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,871
A fair exchange,
that is.

104
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,427
Always held to the notion
of fair exchange

105
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,063
in all my dealings.

106
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:18,516
You give me,
I give you.

107
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:21,486
<i>Fair.</i>

108
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,989
A balance.

109
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,193
No balance anymore.

110
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,950
Could I have
a drink?

111
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,286
Dying is thirsty work.

112
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,048
Wish it were wine.

113
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,134
So do I.

114
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,205
That's where the heart is.

115
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,794
That's how you kill a man.

116
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,087
The fuck you doing?

117
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,957
<i>There's a price</i>
<i>on your head.</i>

118
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:35,760
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

119
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,162
The king's dead.

120
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,315
<i>He drank poisoned wine</i>
<i>at his own wedding.</i>

121
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:43,351
The bounty on you is for
killing Lannister soldiers.

122
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,802
100 silver stags.

123
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,688
And you thought you
were going to collect it?

124
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,824
<i>Didn't think very hard,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

125
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:53,478
You were Yoren's prisoners when
he was taking me to the Wall.

126
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:56,781
He told me he'd fuck
me bloody with a stick.

127
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:00,702
This day's really not working
out the way you planned.

128
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,871
He on your little list?

129
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,290
He can't be.

130
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,709
I don't know his name.

131
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,528
What's your name?

132
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,048
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

133
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,891
You're learning.

134
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,782
<i>Rangers returning!</i>

135
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,120
<i>They return!</i>

136
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,022
- <i>Rangers returning!</i>
- Greetings.

137
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,208
<i>Didn't think I'd see</i>
<i>you again.</i>

138
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,859
All right, Jon?

139
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,528
Welcome back, brother.

140
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,556
Lord Snow.

141
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,096
<i>This is no place</i>
<i>for wild beasts.</i>

142
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,098
Lock him away

143
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,267
or I'll let Hobb throw him
in tonight's stew.

144
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,197
Come on, Ghost.

145
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,453
Mance's army was closing in
on Craster's Keep when we left.

146
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,289
We saw their campfires
from Osric's Hill.

147
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,124
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

148
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,494
I'm surprised you didn't
ride over and say hello.

149
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,712
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

150
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:36,297
We need to prepare.

151
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,715
We've been preparing.

152
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,100
We should seal the tunnel.

153
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,420
Plug it with rocks
and ice.

154
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:43,888
Flood it
and let it freeze.

155
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,356
<i>And how would we</i>
<i>range north?</i>

156
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,425
- We wouldn't.
<i>- Coward.</i>

157
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,260
You would cut off
our legs,

158
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:50,895
pluck out our eyes,

159
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,814
leave us cowering
behind the Wall

160
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,732
hoping for the storm
to pass?

161
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,318
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

162
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,821
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

163
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,208
The Night's Watch has defended
her for thousands of years.

164
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,327
And in all those centuries, we
have never sealed the tunnel.

165
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,630
Have you ever seen
a giant, Ser Alliser?

166
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:10,849
<i>I have.</i>

167
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,800
The tunnel's gate
won't stop them.

168
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,919
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

169
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:16,638
Cold-rolled steel.

170
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,890
They won't stop them.

171
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,228
Remind me which order
you belong to, Lord Snow.

172
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,230
The stewards.

173
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,199
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

174
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,635
No.

175
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,320
Who would that be?

176
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:36,107
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

177
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,326
First Builder Yarwyck,

178
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,329
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

179
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,032
leaving us unable
to carry out our duties

180
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,868
as sworn brothers
of the Night's Watch.

181
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,037
Do you agree with him?

182
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,297
No.

183
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,968
<i>Given your deep knowledge of</i>
<i>the wildling army, Lord Snow,</i>

184
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:07,355
you and Tarly will take
night duties atop the Wall

185
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:09,274
until the full moon.

186
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,061
<i>Moving on.</i>

187
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,981
<i>First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels
of pitch brought atop the wall.</i>

188
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:18,566
<i>Aye.</i>

189
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,392
My lord.

190
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,379
You have new clothes.

191
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,682
Do you like 'em?
Eh?

192
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,102
Gloves are doeskin.

193
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,570
Softer than
a virgin's thighs.

194
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:57,021
<i>I sent for you</i>
<i>days ago.</i>

195
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,857
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

196
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,530
My lonesome
bachelor days are over.

197
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm to wed
Lollys Stokeworth.

198
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,620
Lollys Stokeworth?

199
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:16,240
<i>She doesn't strike me</i>
<i>as your sort of girl.</i>

200
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,260
I wouldn't say I had
a single sort of girl.

201
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:20,878
She's dim-witted.

202
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,313
If I wanted wits,
I'd marry you.

203
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,266
When my sister arranged
this love match,

204
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,436
did she mention that Lollys
has an older sister?

205
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,887
Falyse.

206
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,273
Aye, I did know
about the older sister.

207
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,359
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

208
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,693
Falyse is 40
and barren.

209
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,929
<i>She still gets Castle Stokeworth
when her father dies.</i>

210
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:40,398
She does.

211
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,650
Unless she happens
to perish before her father.

212
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,569
Then Lollys gets the castle.

213
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,623
What? Ladies fall
from their horses

214
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,775
and snap their pretty
necks all the time.

215
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,244
You and my sister
deserve each other.

216
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,080
<i>Why did you bother</i>
<i>to come here?</i>

217
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:05,807
You once said if anyone ever
asked me to sell you out,

218
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,425
you'd double their price.

219
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,761
Is it two wives you want
or two castles?

220
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,512
One of each will do.

221
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,099
But if you want me to kill
the Mountain for you,

222
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,934
it'd better be
a damn big castle.

223
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,320
I'm a bit short
on castles at the moment.

224
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,155
But I can offer you
gold and gratitude.

225
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,857
I have gold.

226
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,325
What can I buy
with gratitude?

227
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,910
You might be surprised.

228
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,780
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

229
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,615
Your sister's
a Lannister, too.

230
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,366
My wife is heir
to Winterfell.

231
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,254
<i>If I emerge from this with my
head still on my shoulders,</i>

232
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:40,058
<i>I may one day rule</i>
<i>the North in her name.</i>

233
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,177
I could carve you out
a big piece of it.

234
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:45,179
If and may and could.

235
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,732
It's bloody
cold up north.

236
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,184
Lollys is soft and warm.

237
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,002
And close.

238
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,689
If I gave you the choice
between fucking Lollys

239
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:56,691
and fighting the Mountain,
you'd have your britches down

240
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,059
and your cock out
before I could blink.

241
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,894
Does he frighten
you so much?

242
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,179
I'd be a bloody fool
if he didn't frighten me.

243
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:04,065
He's freakish big
and freakish strong.

244
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,901
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

245
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:10,538
Maybe I could take him,

246
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,824
dance around
until he's so tired

247
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,592
of hacking at me,
he dropped his sword,

248
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,661
get him off
his feet somehow.

249
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,629
But one misstep...

250
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,364
...and I'm dead.

251
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:22,633
Why should I risk it?

252
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,169
Because you're my friend.

253
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:27,338
Aye, I'm your friend.

254
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,758
And when have you ever
risked your life for me?

255
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:41,936
I like you,

256
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,405
pampered little shit
that you are.

257
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,774
I just like myself more.

258
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,409
I understand.

259
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,111
I'm sorry it has
to be this way.

260
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,779
Why are you sorry?

261
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,865
Because you're
an evil bastard

262
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,833
with no conscience
and no heart?

263
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,536
<i>That's what I liked about</i>
<i>you in the first place.</i>

264
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,044
We had some
good days together.

265
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,880
Yes, we did.

266
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,112
What will you do?

267
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:28,616
I suppose I'll have to kill
the Mountain myself.

268
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,570
Won't that make
for a great song?

269
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,409
I hope to hear
them sing it one day.

270
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,179
How did you get in here?

271
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,847
Your door is well guarded,

272
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,016
but your window is not.

273
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,359
I swam to an island
a mile offshore for these.

274
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,911
Don't do that again.

275
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,865
Never met a woman who
didn't like wildflowers.

276
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,334
These are my
private quarters.

277
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,920
If I want you here,
I will summon you.

278
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,341
Forgive me, my queen.
I live to serve you.

279
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,633
<i>Tell me why you're here.</i>

280
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,539
I came to ask a favor.

281
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,891
I only have two talents
in this world--

282
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,277
war and women.

283
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,980
<i>You are staying here</i>
<i>in Meereen to rule.</i>

284
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,198
<i>That is a wise decision.</i>
<i>I respect it.</i>

285
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,117
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

286
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,786
I've ordered the Second Sons
to patrol the streets

287
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,538
to stop
the revenge killing.

288
00:20:57,572 --> 00:20:58,856
You've ordered us
to be night watchmen.

289
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,825
And as for women,

290
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,578
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

291
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,381
There is only one,

292
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,051
and she does not
want me.

293
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,887
You swore me your sword.

294
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,506
My sword is yours
till the day I die.

295
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,675
So if I command you
to stay in Meereen

296
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,176
and patrol the streets?

297
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,896
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

298
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,415
Send me to kill
your enemies.

299
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,734
Any enemy anywhere.

300
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,321
Let me do
what I do best.

301
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,524
Very well.

302
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,582
Do what you do best.

303
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,628
Take off your clothes.

304
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,376
Oh.

305
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,629
Come in, my queen.
Please.

306
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:30,614
I didn't mean
to disturb you, my lady.

307
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,133
You could never
disturb me.

308
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,552
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

309
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,421
Could you bring me
that vial over there?

310
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,892
The blue one.

311
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:46,430
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Not that one.</i>

312
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,649
You don't even want
to touch that one.

313
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,851
<i>Next to it.</i>

314
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,903
<i>That's the one.</i>

315
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,591
When I looked into
the flames this morning,

316
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,843
the Lord spoke to me.

317
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:17,762
He said,

318
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:22,266
"Tonight, you will have your
last good bath in a long while.

319
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,518
Make it count."

320
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,140
A joke.

321
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,943
Not a very good one,
I'm afraid.

322
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,812
It was. I--

323
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,481
humor isn't my strength.

324
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,150
That's because
most jokes are lies

325
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,869
and you're devoted
to the truth.

326
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:45,156
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

327
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,658
Not always.

328
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,220
Most of these powders
and potions

329
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,871
are lies.

330
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:05,426
<i>Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our Lord's power.</i>

331
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,929
Once they step into his light, they
will see the lie for what it was--

332
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,266
a trick that led them
to the truth.

333
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,069
<i>A pinch of this powder</i>
<i>in a bonfire</i>

334
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:18,355
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

335
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:21,158
And this one creates
a black smoke

336
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,611
that will make the bravest
man piss himself with fear.

337
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,081
And a drop of this
in any man's wine

338
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,416
will drive him
wild with lust.

339
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,872
Did you use it
with Stannis?

340
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,257
No.

341
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,577
Don't be upset.

342
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:43,797
Men never crave
what they already have.

343
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,584
It's only flesh.

344
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:50,221
It needs
what it needs.

345
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,443
No act done in service
of the Lord

346
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:59,280
can ever be called a sin.

347
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:02,766
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

348
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:05,369
And Stannis to you.

349
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,907
He wants to bring
Shireen with us.

350
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,378
I think that would be
ill-advised.

351
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:18,048
<i>My daughter has heretical
tendencies, as you're well aware.</i>

352
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,886
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

353
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,306
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

354
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,612
I understand
how you feel.

355
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,013
Hmm.

356
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,266
But that
is impossible.

357
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,104
Why?

358
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,974
You don't need powders
and potions, my queen.

359
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:46,143
You don't need lies.

360
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,646
You are strong enough to
look into the Lord's light

361
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:51,999
and see his truth
for yourself.

362
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,957
However harsh it is.

363
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,459
However hard for us
to understand.

364
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,546
<i>You don't need my help,</i>

365
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,382
<i>but I will need yours soon.</i>

366
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,468
When we set sail, your
daughter must be with us.

367
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,141
The Lord needs her.

368
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,867
Jorah the Andal.

369
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,204
Are you here
to see our queen?

370
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,041
She's in a good mood.

371
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,008
Khaleesi.

372
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,427
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

373
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,214
You don't approve?

374
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,650
It's not a question of approval,
it's a question of trust.

375
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,019
You neither
approve nor trust.

376
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,654
Why would I?
The man's a sellsword.

377
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,222
Didn't you fight for
the Golden Company

378
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,774
before pledging
your sword to my brother?

379
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,492
I did.

380
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,943
I trust you.

381
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,446
Daario Naharis
killed his captains

382
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,666
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

383
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,202
How could you ever have
faith in a man like that?

384
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,588
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

385
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,759
That's why I've sent him and the
Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

386
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,014
- You have?
- I have.

387
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,099
Without you there
to rule, Khaleesi,

388
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,418
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

389
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,687
wait for the invaders
to leave and reassert control.

390
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,858
That is why I've ordered Daario to
execute every master in Yunkai.

391
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,862
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

392
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,364
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

393
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,783
They train little girls in the
art of pleasuring old men.

394
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:52,953
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

395
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:56,540
Herding the masters into pens and
slaughtering them by the thousands

396
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,575
is also treating men
like beasts.

397
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,744
The slaves you freed,

398
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:02,913
brutality is all
they've ever known.

399
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,049
If you want them to know
something else,

400
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,450
you'll have
to show it to them.

401
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,552
And repay the slavers
with what? Kindness?

402
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,087
A fine?
A stern warning?

403
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,257
It's tempting to see your
enemies as evil, all of them,

404
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,009
but there's good and evil on both
sides in every war ever fought.

405
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,512
Let the priests argue
over good and evil.

406
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,097
Slavery is real.

407
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,349
I can end it.
I will end it.

408
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,685
<i>And I will end</i>
<i>those behind it.</i>

409
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,920
I sold men
into slavery, Khaleesi.

410
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:31,808
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

411
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:35,195
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

412
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,082
what you want to do
to the masters of Yunkai.

413
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,506
The man who came to me the other
day about burying his father.

414
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,624
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

415
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:50,344
He will accompany
the Second Sons

416
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,329
and serve as my
ambassador to Yunkai.

417
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:55,332
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

418
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,936
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

419
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,888
They can live
in my new world

420
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,974
or they can die
in their old one.

421
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,564
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

422
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,483
Tell him
I changed my mind.

423
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,868
Yes, Khaleesi.

424
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,825
No.

425
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:27,414
Tell him<i> you</i>
changed my mind.

426
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,078
Rat cunts.

427
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,815
Fucking whore.

428
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,352
<i>You're doing it wrong.</i>

429
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,321
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

430
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,074
<i>Otherwise it's gonna</i>
<i>get infected and fester.</i>

431
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,530
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right--

432
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,498
No fire.

433
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:04,785
It'll only take a second.

434
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,204
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

435
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,887
Shut up about it.

436
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:28,642
Shut up about everything.

437
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,361
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

438
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,647
anywhere the Lannisters
hold sway.

439
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,201
Which is everywhere
between where we are now

440
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,236
and where we're going.

441
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:44,908
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

442
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:49,079
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

443
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,001
No reward is worth
this much trouble.

444
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,970
<i>Wish I'd never</i>
<i>laid eyes on you.</i>

445
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,234
You say your brother
gave you that sword.

446
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,655
My brother gave me this.

447
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:18,909
It was just like you said
a while back.

448
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,744
<i>Pressed me to the fire</i>

449
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,664
like I was a nice
juicy mutton chop.

450
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,452
Why?

451
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,337
Thought I stole
one of his toys.

452
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,956
I didn't steal it. I was
just playing with it.

453
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,829
The pain was bad.

454
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,882
The smell was worse.

455
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:49,222
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

456
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:56,313
My father,
who protected him...

457
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,984
told everyone my bedding
caught fire.

458
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,083
You think
you're on your own?

459
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,704
Let me wash it out

460
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,973
and help you
sew it up at least.

461
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,868
Bit of comfort
never hurt anyone.

462
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,087
We've been sleeping in
ditches the last few weeks.

463
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,957
I think we can treat ourselves
to a featherbed for the night

464
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,876
and a hot meal
not cooked by you.

465
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,378
Couldn't agree
more, my lady.

466
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,296
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

467
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,582
Not working for your
former lord any longer.

468
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,884
- Yes, my lady.
- Don't get drunk.

469
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:10,721
No, my lady.

470
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,222
<i>Can I get you</i>
<i>anything else?</i>

471
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,024
No, this will do
nicely, thank you.

472
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,592
Kidney pie is wonderful.

473
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,561
Thanks.

474
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,780
I do my best.

475
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,984
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

476
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,987
<i>Flour, lard, water,</i>
<i>eggs, milk.</i>

477
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,822
Easy enough.
But the meat,

478
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,825
peacetime or not, getting your
hands on a good bottom round steak

479
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,543
and calves' kidneys
is not easy.

480
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,129
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

481
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,448
Got no right to cook
anything, them.

482
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:40,050
Oh, and the gravy.

483
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,918
Don't get me started
on the gravy.

484
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:43,303
<i>Very difficult</i>
<i>to get right.</i>

485
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:45,138
<i>See, a lot of people</i>
<i>give up on the gravy.</i>

486
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:47,391
You cannot give up
on the gravy.

487
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,975
No gravy, no pie.

488
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,428
Simple as that.

489
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,765
That's nice armor.
Are you a knight?

490
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,351
No.

491
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,521
Oh, it's just people with
armor are usually knights.

492
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,241
<i>Generally speaking. From King's
Landing, though, aren't you?</i>

493
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,110
<i>From there myself originally.</i>
<i>Flea Bottom born and bred.</i>

494
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:08,945
<i>What brings you</i>
<i>to these parts?</i>

495
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,980
We're looking
for someone.

496
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:13,450
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

497
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,819
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17--

498
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:17,788
A girl, tall, red hair,
very pretty.

499
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,324
Her name is Sansa Stark, but she
may be using a different name.

500
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,293
Starks?

501
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,299
What, like them lot
from "Winterhell"?

502
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,855
No, ain't seen
anyone like that.

503
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,640
I heard they was
all traitors.

504
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,975
Don't need
no traitors in here.

505
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:42,345
<i>I pledged my life to</i>
<i>their mother Catelyn Stark.</i>

506
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,581
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

507
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,538
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

508
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,837
What?

509
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,472
It's nothing, my lady.

510
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,842
You wouldn't be screwing your face
up like that if it was nothing.

511
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,344
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

512
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,179
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

513
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,267
The Lannisters
want Lady Sansa.

514
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,986
The Lannisters
have money.

515
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,821
People kill for money.

516
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,908
I don't think we should
be telling people

517
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,526
we're searching
for Lady Sansa.

518
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:42,238
My lady. My lord.
Could I have a word?

519
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:44,207
What about?
Not kidney pie.

520
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:45,792
<i>You seem</i>
<i>like a proper lady.</i>

521
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,261
<i>Someone who could</i>
<i>be trusted.</i>

522
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:52,415
I never met no Sansa Stark.

523
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,518
But I know her sister...

524
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,386
Arya.

525
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,142
No one's seen Arya Stark since
her father was beheaded.

526
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,995
She's presumed dead.

527
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,947
She weren't when I last
spoke to her.

528
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:09,366
- When was that? -<i> Heading up
north with the Night's Watch.</i>

529
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,901
She was all dressed up
as a boy.

530
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,770
Like your ladyship,
only without the armor.

531
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,622
<i>Going by the name Arry.</i>

532
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,440
- So what happened to her?
- Well--

533
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,626
The quick version.

534
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,494
The Lannisters
took us prisoner.

535
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,380
We escaped.

536
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,615
The Brotherhood took
us prisoner.

537
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,116
They sold me
to the innkeep.

538
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:29,719
<i>They were gonna sell Arya</i>
<i>to her mother at Riverrun</i>

539
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,054
<i>along with another prisoner.</i>

540
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,973
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth

541
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:35,008
and a face like
a half-burnt ham.

542
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,977
- <i>Not friendly.</i>
- The Hound.

543
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:38,795
That's the one.

544
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:42,131
If you find her,
could you give her this?

545
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:43,967
She liked the last one
I gave her,

546
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:46,319
but, well, this one
turned out better.

547
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,615
Um, you were saying?

548
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,372
<i>Her mother's dead,</i>
<i>grandfather's dead,</i>

549
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,791
Walder Frey is
the new lord of Riverrun.

550
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,676
The Brotherhood
isn't going to Riverrun.

551
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,661
They'll take her
to the Eyrie, my lady.

552
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,496
Why the Eyrie?

553
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,999
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

554
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,101
Catelyn Stark's sister.

555
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,170
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

556
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,940
She hates the Lannisters.

557
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:28,228
Lord Tyrion
made sure I knew

558
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,364
which house married which
and who hated who.

559
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,116
Sansa could
be there, too.

560
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,619
Aye, my lady.

561
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,320
Could be.

562
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:45,662
You sure about this?

563
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,550
No.

564
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:24,501
I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

565
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:29,255
I did spend some time with an absolutely
stunning blonde the other day.

566
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,108
Mm, do tell.

567
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,545
I've got every kind
of filth down here

568
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,097
except the kind I like.

569
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:39,132
Your sister.

570
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,384
Oh.

571
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,976
Cersei approached me.

572
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,330
<i>We spoke a great deal</i>
<i>about her daughter.</i>

573
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,449
How worried your sister
is about her.

574
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:59,402
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>very hard to pretend</i>

575
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,438
<i>she had not come</i>
<i>to sway me against you.</i>

576
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,773
<i>I think she may have even</i>
<i>believed it herself.</i>

577
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,826
Making honest feelings
do dishonest work

578
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,295
is one of her many gifts.

579
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,332
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

580
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:17,137
It is rare
to meet a Lannister

581
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:21,174
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

582
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:25,762
She desperately wants
to see you killed.

583
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,981
She didn't need
to bother you.

584
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:31,818
It looks as though I've
taken care of that myself.

585
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:34,437
<i>The joy she will feel</i>

586
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:37,023
<i>when my head</i>
<i>leaves my neck.</i>

587
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,310
She's wanted this
for a long time.

588
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,146
Yes, I know.

589
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,166
<i>We met, you and I.</i>

590
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,817
Many years ago.

591
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,787
I think I would
have remembered that.

592
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,124
Unlikely.
You had just been born.

593
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,095
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

594
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,830
on a visit
to Casterly Rock.

595
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:02,832
<i>My first time</i>
<i>away from Dorne.</i>

596
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,218
I didn't like anything
about the Rock.

597
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,189
Not the food,
not the weather,

598
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:10,890
not your accents.

599
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,559
Nothing.

600
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,512
But the biggest
disappointment...

601
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,815
you.

602
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,653
You and my family have more in
common than you might admit.

603
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,872
<i>The whole way from Dorne</i>

604
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:28,741
all anyone talked about
was the monster

605
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,744
that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

606
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,664
<i>A head twice</i>
<i>the size of his body,</i>

607
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,583
<i>a tail between his legs,</i>

608
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,718
claws, one red eye,

609
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:41,671
the privates of both
a girl and a boy.

610
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,640
That would have made
things so much easier.

611
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,543
<i>When we met your sister, she
promised she would show you to us.</i>

612
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,212
Every day we would ask.

613
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,681
Every day she would
say, "Soon."

614
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:55,018
Then she and your brother

615
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,404
took us
to your nursery and...

616
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,775
she unveiled the freak.

617
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,830
<i>Your head</i>
<i>was a bit large.</i>

618
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,765
<i>Your arms and legs</i>
<i>were a bit small,</i>

619
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,450
but no claw.

620
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,786
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.

621
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,206
Just a tiny pink cock.

622
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,008
<i>We didn't try to hide</i>
<i>our disappointment.</i>

623
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,461
<i>"That's not a monster,"</i>
<i>I told Cersei.</i>

624
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,514
"That's just a baby."

625
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,635
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"He killed my mother."</i>

626
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,187
<i>And she pinched</i>
<i>your little cock so hard,</i>

627
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,223
<i>I thought she might</i>
<i>pull it off.</i>

628
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,358
<i>Until your brother</i>
<i>made her stop.</i>

629
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,460
<i>"It doesn't matter,"</i>
<i>she told us.</i>

630
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,446
<i>"Everyone says</i>
<i>he will die soon.</i>

631
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,115
<i>I hope they are right.</i>

632
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:44,817
<i>He should not</i>
<i>have lived this long."</i>

633
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,039
Well...

634
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:57,297
sooner or later, Cersei
always gets what she wants.

635
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,352
And what about
what I want?

636
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,923
Justice

637
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:10,560
for my sister
and her children.

638
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,595
If you want justice,

639
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:15,515
you've come
to the wrong place.

640
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,767
I disagree.

641
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,328
I've come to
the perfect place.

642
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,415
I want to bring those who
have wronged me to justice.

643
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,535
And all those who have
wronged me are right here.

644
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:40,089
I will begin with
Ser Gregor Clegane,

645
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,875
<i>who killed</i>
<i>my sister's children</i>

646
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,296
and then raped her with their
blood still on his hands

647
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,048
before killing her, too.

648
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,809
I will be your champion.

649
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,865
Hello, Robin.

650
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:59,786
What are you doing?

651
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,754
I'm building my home,
Winterfell.

652
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,840
At least I think I am.

653
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,542
I haven't been back there
in a very long time.

654
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:08,928
Why did you leave?

655
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:11,347
It's a long story.

656
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,583
I stay here in the Eyrie.

657
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,370
Mother says it's dangerous on the
roads and I have to keep myself safe

658
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,038
because I'm the Lord
of the Vale

659
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,391
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

660
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,726
Yes, you certainly are.

661
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,995
When will you go back?

662
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,731
Probably never.

663
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:30,867
My family doesn't
live there anymore

664
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,369
and someone
burned it down.

665
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,239
Oh.

666
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,042
Does Winterfell
have a Moon Door?

667
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,843
No, I'm afraid not.

668
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,995
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

669
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,881
That sounds dangerous.

670
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,717
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

671
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,135
What do you do with
all the bad people

672
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:51,637
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

673
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,222
I never did anything
with them at all.

674
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,892
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

675
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,228
Well, I'm Lord
of the Vale.

676
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,565
When I grow up, I'll be able
to fly anybody who bothers me.

677
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,934
Or you.
When we get married,

678
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,736
you can tell me
if you don't like somebody

679
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,021
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

680
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,907
Right through
the Moon Door.

681
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,527
I like the sound of that.

682
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,312
Let's put a Moon Door
in your Winterfell.

683
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,780
All right.

684
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,782
It can go in here
in this big tower.

685
00:45:19,816 --> 00:45:21,868
Careful.
You've ruined it.

686
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,336
Now I'm going to have
to rebuild the whole thing.

687
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,921
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

688
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,906
It was already ruined because
it didn't have a Moon Door.

689
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,291
I was fixing it.

690
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,658
Knocking things down
isn't fixing them.

691
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,461
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

692
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,963
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

693
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,059
Robin, I'm sorry, I--

694
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,695
<i>Children.</i>

695
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:55,684
- <i>I hit him.</i>
- Yes, I saw.

696
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,036
I shouldn't have done that.

697
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,189
No, his mother
should have

698
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,508
a long time ago.

699
00:46:02,543 --> 00:46:05,912
Consider it a step
in the right direction.

700
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:09,081
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

701
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,501
Let me worry about
Aunt Lysa.

702
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:15,638
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

703
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,941
I'll never see it again.

704
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,729
A lot can happen
between now and never.

705
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,050
If you want to build
a better home,

706
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:30,903
first you must
demolish the old one.

707
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:35,942
Why did you really
kill Joffrey?

708
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,165
Tell me why.

709
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,006
I loved your mother more
than you could ever know.

710
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,344
Given the opportunity,
what do we do to those

711
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,413
who've hurt
the ones we love?

712
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,139
In a better world,

713
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,559
one where love

714
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:13,529
could overcome
strength and duty,

715
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,283
you might have been
my child.

716
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,822
But we don't live
in that world.

717
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:36,836
You're more beautiful
than she ever was.

718
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,256
Lord Baelish...

719
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,258
Call me Petyr.

720
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:11,654
<i>You wanted</i>
<i>to see me, Aunt Lysa?</i>

721
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,258
Come here, Sansa.

722
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,774
Do you know how far
the fall is?

723
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,777
No.

724
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,013
<i>Neither do I, precisely.</i>

725
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,582
<i>Hundreds of feet.</i>

726
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,734
It's fascinating

727
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:45,655
what happens to bodies when they
hit the rocks from such a height.

728
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,707
The impact breaks them
right apart.

729
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:51,160
Like eggs dropped
on the floor.

730
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,629
Sometimes pieces
remain intact.

731
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:56,332
You'll find the head
sitting on its own.

732
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,467
Every hair in place.

733
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,387
Blue eyes staring
at nothing.

734
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,932
I know what you did.

735
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,936
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

736
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,822
I never should have hit Robin, I know it.
I promise it won't happen--

737
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,574
Don't be coy with me,
you little whore.

738
00:49:21,608 --> 00:49:24,059
You kissed him.
You kissed Petyr.

739
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:26,278
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

740
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,615
You can't lie to me because
I saw it with my own eyes.

741
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,500
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar!

742
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,420
Whore! He is mine!

743
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:36,956
My father, my husband,
my sister,

744
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,175
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

745
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,262
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

746
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:44,964
Look down!

747
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,416
Look down!
Look down! Look down!

748
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:50,302
<i>Lysa!</i>

749
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,972
Let her go.

750
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,027
You want her?

751
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,697
This empty-headed child?

752
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,232
Let her go.

753
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,068
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

754
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:08,637
I lied for you.

755
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,673
<i>I killed for you.</i>

756
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,042
Why did you bring
her here? Why?

757
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,994
I'll send her away.

758
00:50:16,296 --> 00:50:18,881
I swear on my life.

759
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:22,385
I swear to all the gods.

760
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,287
Let her go, Lysa.

761
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,691
Oh, my sweet wife.

762
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:51,447
My sweet, silly wife.

763
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:01,257
I have only loved
one woman...

764
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,009
only one,

765
00:51:04,044 --> 00:51:06,462
my entire life.

766
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,219
Your sister.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
