1
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,812
You did this.
You did this!

2
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,162
- We have to leave.
- Cersei:<i> Take him! Take him!</i>

3
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,807
Where is his wife?

4
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:33,875
Where's Sansa?

5
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:36,203
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

6
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,655
<i>Seize every ship in the harbor.</i>

7
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:42,216
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

8
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:44,277
<i>No one!</i>

9
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:47,516
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

10
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,703
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

11
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,570
Somewhere safe.

12
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,611
Up you go, my lady.

13
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,811
You'll be fine.

14
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,764
You're stronger than you know.

15
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,514
( gasps )

16
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,348
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

17
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,502
Are you hurt, my lady?

18
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,235
Good. Good.

19
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:37,059
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

20
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:39,050
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

21
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:41,640
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

22
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:44,300
Voices carry over water.

23
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,331
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

24
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,394
First you'll want your pay.

25
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,265
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

26
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,422
( snaps fingers )

27
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,120
Wait!
( groans )

28
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,541
( screams )

29
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,533
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

30
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,450
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

31
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,086
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

32
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:09,991
And if they found you,

33
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:13,624
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

34
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,011
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

35
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,325
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

36
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,413
The king who
executed your father,

37
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,654
who tormented you for years,

38
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,383
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

39
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:27,611
Why did you kill him?

40
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,371
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

41
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:33,229
and I don't trust drunk fools.

42
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,510
He saved me.

43
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:38,480
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

44
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:42,794
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

45
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:45,559
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

46
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,986
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

47
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:54,078
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

48
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:58,154
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

49
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,298
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

50
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:04,455
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

51
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:15,215
I had it made a few weeks ago.

52
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:19,398
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

53
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,167
We're all liars here.

54
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,838
Come, my lady.

55
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,474
I know you've had
a difficult day.

56
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,606
But you're safe now.

57
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:32,767
I promise you that.

58
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,977
You're safe with me

59
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:37,670
and sailing home.

60
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:46,308
So am I the queen?

61
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,131
More than you were with Renly.

62
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:51,198
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

63
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,163
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

64
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:57,397
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

65
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,354
to press the issue.

66
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,219
Clawing at his own throat,

67
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:04,063
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

68
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,603
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

69
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:09,048
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

70
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:13,619
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

71
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,492
Made me look at it.

72
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,033
What was it like?

73
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:20,187
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

74
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:22,094
The man I'd married

75
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:25,292
and suffered to father
my children.

76
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,618
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

77
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,991
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

78
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:33,691
There he was...

79
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,101
lying on a table.

80
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:42,459
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

81
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,141
and was stabbed
through the heart.

82
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:46,528
Another was happiest
torturing animals

83
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,779
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

84
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,783
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

85
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,769
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

86
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:58,319
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

87
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,234
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

88
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,226
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

89
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,334
But I would have been the queen.

90
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:06,254
Our alliance with the Lannisters

91
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,858
remains every bit
as necessary to them

92
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,358
as it is unpleasant for us.

93
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,335
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

94
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:17,471
The next one should be easier.

95
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,078
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

96
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,438
Do you know what that means?

97
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:39,062
I'm not trying to trick you.

98
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,179
It means I'll become king.

99
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,577
Yes, you will become king.

100
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,911
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

101
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:50,670
A good king?

102
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,065
Mm, I think so as well.

103
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:57,531
You've got the right
temperament for it.

104
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:01,330
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

105
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,754
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

106
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:07,006
This is hardly
the place or the time.

107
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,962
Holiness?

108
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:11,163
Hmm.

109
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:14,453
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

110
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:16,734
And pious.

111
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,334
He built this sept.

112
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:22,637
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

113
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:26,052
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

114
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:30,058
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

115
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,208
because food was of this world

116
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,481
and this world was sinful.

117
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,414
Justice.

118
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:40,155
Yeah.

119
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,515
A good king must be just.

120
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,376
Orys I was just.

121
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,838
Everyone applauded his reforms.

122
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,874
Nobles and commoners alike.

123
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,032
But he wasn't just for long.

124
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,081
He was murdered in his sleep

125
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,352
after less than a year
by his own brother.

126
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,564
Was that truly just of him?

127
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,844
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

128
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,056
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

129
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,466
- No.
- No.

130
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,635
- What about strength?
- Yes.

131
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,983
Strength.

132
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,198
King Robert was strong.

133
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:19,716
He won the rebellion

134
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:23,305
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

135
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:26,240
And he attended three
small council meetings

136
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,138
in 17 years.

137
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:32,543
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

138
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:35,194
until the last two killed him.

139
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,576
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

140
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,101
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

141
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:46,841
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

142
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:51,878
What do they all lack?

143
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:58,127
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

144
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,200
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

145
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,829
Yes.

146
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:04,602
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

147
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,363
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

148
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:11,219
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

149
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:14,174
against another house
with a strong navy

150
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,605
that could one day oppose you.

151
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:20,063
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

152
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:24,006
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

153
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,180
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

154
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:29,193
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

155
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,671
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

156
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,475
You're young.

157
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:37,910
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

158
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:41,564
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

159
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,488
And the wisest kings

160
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:47,470
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

161
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,155
Your brother was not
a wise king.

162
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,616
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

163
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,546
<i>If he had been,</i>

164
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,391
perhaps he'd still be alive.

165
00:12:57,488 --> 00:13:00,542
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

166
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,819
Do you understand why?

167
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,615
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

168
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,444
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

169
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:10,089
To further the family line.

170
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:13,382
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

171
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,236
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

172
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,925
I don't think so.

173
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,243
It's all relatively
straightforward.

174
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:24,606
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

175
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:26,854
You are.
You will be.

176
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,131
I'll see to that.

177
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:36,375
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

178
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,374
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

179
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,825
( snaps fingers )

180
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:02,365
( doors echo shut )

181
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,731
It was Tyrion.

182
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:12,813
He killed him.

183
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:16,703
He told me he would.

184
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:21,779
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

185
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,589
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

186
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,676
That's what he said to me.

187
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:36,611
You saw it.

188
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:39,311
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

189
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,603
I don't know what I saw.

190
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:46,306
Avenge him.

191
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,889
Avenge our son.

192
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:51,797
Kill Tyrion.

193
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,571
Tyrion's my brother.

194
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,514
<i>Our brother.</i>

195
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,991
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

196
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:03,486
I don't want a trial.

197
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,946
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

198
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:08,763
I want him dead.

199
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,649
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

200
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:16,052
You have to.

201
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,579
He was our son.

202
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,990
Our baby boy.

203
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,904
( gasps )

204
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:03,361
You're a hateful woman.

205
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,702
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

206
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,016
Jaime, not here, please.

207
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,567
Please.

208
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,548
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

209
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:23,669
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

210
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:26,244
Stop it.
Stop.

211
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:32,813
Stop.

212
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:42,931
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

213
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,785
It's not right.
It's not right.

214
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,746
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

215
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,821
- Don't.
- I don't care.

216
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:52,141
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

217
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,437
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

218
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,362
Gonna rain soon.

219
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:58,629
( urinating )

220
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:00,791
Where are we?

221
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:05,768
Near Fairmarket, I think.

222
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,304
You think?

223
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:08,689
You don't have a map?

224
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,870
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

225
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,986
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

226
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,938
How far is it to the Eyrie?

227
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,783
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

228
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,048
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

229
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,890
Get my gold, be on my way.

230
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:28,954
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

231
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,425
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

232
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:40,714
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

233
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,290
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

234
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:46,972
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

235
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:49,277
Why Braavos?

236
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,961
I have friends there.

237
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:53,155
( blows )
I doubt it.

238
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,933
Seven blessings to you.

239
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,444
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

240
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,267
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

241
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:06,913
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

242
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,513
Forgive my father.

243
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,050
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

244
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,577
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

245
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,840
He's never been the same.

246
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,243
Which house did he fight for?

247
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:37,898
The Tullys of Riverrun.

248
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,429
There's a storm coming.

249
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,944
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

250
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,163
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

251
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,408
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

252
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:54,627
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

253
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:59,410
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

254
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:02,064
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

255
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:04,562
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

256
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,575
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

257
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,524
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

258
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,610
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

259
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,839
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

260
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:16,048
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

261
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,326
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

262
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:20,057
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

263
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,963
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

264
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,363
Father!

265
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,806
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

266
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,902
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

267
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:37,058
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

268
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,416
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

269
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,995
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

270
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,730
I'm so sorry.

271
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,255
( slurping loudly )

272
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:10,614
Really good.

273
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,771
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

274
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,206
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

275
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,426
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

276
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:20,265
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

277
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:23,785
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

278
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:26,026
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

279
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,672
It means something to me.

280
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,173
The gods will have
their vengeance.

281
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:34,230
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

282
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,548
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

283
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:40,361
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

284
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,219
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

285
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:47,255
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

286
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,368
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

287
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:52,571
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

288
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,514
You got any ale?

289
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,626
Afraid not.

290
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:03,266
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

291
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,914
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

292
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,518
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

293
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:14,381
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

294
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,042
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

295
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:19,782
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

296
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,318
Sally does what she can,

297
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:24,494
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

298
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,656
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

299
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:29,864
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

300
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:33,187
Meaning no offense.

301
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,269
What'll you pay?

302
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,293
I don't have much.

303
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:46,998
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

304
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,985
Fair wages for fair work?

305
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,501
Fair wages for fair work.

306
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,144
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

307
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:13,891
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

308
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:20,534
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

309
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:22,918
<i>( girl screams )</i>

310
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,668
<i>( man groaning )</i>

311
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,162
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

312
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,234
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

313
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:39,989
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

314
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,817
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

315
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:43,438
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

316
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:45,227
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

317
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,779
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

318
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,470
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

319
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:53,101
They'll both be dead
come winter.

320
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:54,988
Dead men don't need silver.

321
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:59,139
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

322
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,298
There's plenty worse than me.

323
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,669
I just understand
the way things are.

324
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,369
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

325
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,090
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

326
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:16,914
Horse thief.

327
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:19,225
Ninth born son.

328
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,184
Raper.

329
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,467
Thief.
Thief and raper.

330
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:27,114
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

331
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:28,892
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

332
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,118
- She's not a whore.
- No?

333
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:33,614
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

334
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,655
They all think I'm lying.

335
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,366
About what?

336
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:44,627
Killing the white walker.

337
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:47,564
You're not lying.

338
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:49,698
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

339
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,576
But you're the only one
that saw it.

340
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:55,291
And they all think
you're just a--

341
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:56,553
A what?

342
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:59,648
Well, a wildling.

343
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:02,517
My father hated that word.

344
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:05,878
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

345
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:07,761
I don't know.

346
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:11,876
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

347
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,315
So...

348
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:27,059
are you all right?

349
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,609
No one bothering you?

350
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,271
I get a lot of looks.

351
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,368
I hear them making their jokes.

352
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,332
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

353
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,567
I worry about it sometimes.

354
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:41,894
All the time.

355
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:44,896
Why do you worry about it?

356
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:48,069
100 men, one woman.

357
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,869
I've got other things
to think about.

358
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:52,932
That's the only thing
they think about.

359
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,491
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

360
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:59,714
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

361
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:03,701
What about you?

362
00:25:05,392 --> 00:25:06,993
What about me?

363
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:12,051
Gilly?

364
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:18,836
I worry about you.

365
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,499
Thank you.

366
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:26,805
For what?

367
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:29,184
For worrying about me.

368
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:36,172
I don't know
if you're safe here.

369
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,282
They're my brothers,

370
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,705
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

371
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,346
Some of them were rapers.

372
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:45,134
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

373
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,648
So what are you saying?

374
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:56,054
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

375
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:02,863
Are you bored of me?

376
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,643
Bored of you?

377
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:08,156
I...

378
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,627
I want to protect you.

379
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,891
I'll get these to Hobb.

380
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,323
Keep an eye on little Sam.

381
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:50,659
<i>( door closes )</i>

382
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:53,736
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

383
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:55,771
Your Grace.

384
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,007
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

385
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:12,600
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

386
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,984
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

387
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:18,782
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

388
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:21,206
A bastard you set free.

389
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,826
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

390
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:25,682
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

391
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,464
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

392
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,984
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

393
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,030
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

394
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,705
House Peasebury.

395
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:36,976
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

396
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,339
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

397
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,634
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

398
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:47,618
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

399
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:50,906
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

400
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:52,712
We need to look east
for ships and men.

401
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:55,988
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

402
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,060
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

403
00:27:58,129 --> 00:27:59,495
They're sellswords.

404
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,278
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

405
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:03,058
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

406
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,450
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

407
00:28:05,532 --> 00:28:07,702
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

408
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:10,558
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

409
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,937
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

410
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:14,302
It's dirty on the ground.

411
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,163
We don't have any gold.

412
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,427
Not yet.

413
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,433
If I do not press my claim,

414
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:25,553
my claim will be forgotten.

415
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:29,064
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

416
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:32,286
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

417
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:35,529
Which means you're
running out of time.

418
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,424
<i>( knocking )</i>

419
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,071
You're late.

420
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:43,651
I'm sorry, Princess.

421
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,440
I thought you weren't coming.

422
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,073
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

423
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:51,698
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

424
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:53,221
That happened once, weeks ago.

425
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:55,278
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

426
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:57,276
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

427
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:59,884
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

428
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:02,174
But I think you can manage.

429
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,386
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

430
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,660
That's how children do it.

of Elyo Grivas

00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:20,135
First Sword of Braavos."

433
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:22,144
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

434
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:25,425
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

435
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,193
You were a pirate once.

436
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:29,098
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

437
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:30,321
What's the difference?

438
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:32,290
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

439
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:33,965
you're not doing it right.

440
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,789
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

441
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:37,505
Your father lacks
an appreciation

442
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,765
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

443
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,933
So do the Braavosi.

444
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:43,659
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

445
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:46,450
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

446
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:50,725
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

447
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:54,568
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

448
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:56,383
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

449
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:58,853
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

450
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:02,890
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

451
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:23,587
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

452
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:25,760
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

453
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,360
It's too important for me.

454
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:30,516
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

455
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:34,594
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

456
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,349
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

457
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:39,969
But that's not you.

458
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:41,709
I need to get their attention.

459
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:44,470
Go on. Write.

460
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:51,372

adventures, hasn't he?

No.

468

Where's the daddy?

469
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,979
He's dead.

470

Oh. Where you from?

00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:37,604
North of here.

North of here?

473
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:45,837
You a fucking wildling?

474
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:48,704
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

475
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,405
She'll clean and cook

476
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:52,989
and look after the other
girls' babies.

477
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,807
Could find other
work for her, too.

478
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,395
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

479
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,089
Give you a piece of it.

480
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:02,613
No other work.

481
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:26,849
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

482
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:32,339
You'll be safer here.

483
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,774
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

484
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:37,634
You protected me
north of the Wall.

485
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,550
This is different.

486
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,013
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

487
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:42,831
and I can't just stab
them in the back

488
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:45,947
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

489
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:47,981
( baby crying )

490
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,990
You have to trust me.

491
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,710
It's for the best.

492
00:32:57,913 --> 00:32:59,231
Best for you.

493
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,828
Oh, Gilly.

494
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:05,049
Please don't.

495
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:06,982
( baby crying )

496
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:19,794
( moaning )

497
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,001
Greedy.

498
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,193
No?

499
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:50,096
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

500
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:52,023
I just never acquired the taste.

501
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:54,627
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

502
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:58,385
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

503
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:03,488
Your loss.

504
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:11,084
You like them both the same?

505
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,303
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

506
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:15,033
Everyone has a preference.

507
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,860
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

508
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:22,652
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

509
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,545
The gods made this

510
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,535
and it delights me.

511
00:34:26,602 --> 00:34:29,496
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

512
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:33,292
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

513
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,671
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

514
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,405
What are you, 25?

515
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:40,597
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

516
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:43,070
Someday, if you're lucky,

517
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:44,886
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

518
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:46,957
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

519
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:50,323
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

520
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:54,408
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

521
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:56,843
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

522
00:34:56,924 --> 00:35:00,127
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

523
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,107
Did you?

524
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:06,135
He is a prince of Dorne.

525
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,084
Girls and boys will line up

526
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:12,102
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

527
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:17,690
They will all have
to line up behind you.

528
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,334
<i>( door opens )</i>

529
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,886
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

530
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:28,234
May we have the room?

531
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:33,973
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

532
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,363
Would you like to sit?

533
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:48,691
No, thank you.

534
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,296
Some wine?

535
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,327
<i>No, thank you.</i>

536
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:54,115
<i>( door closes )</i>

537
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:56,796
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

538
00:35:56,887 --> 00:36:00,809
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

539
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:03,533
Or his grandfather.

540
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,825
An awful way to die.

541
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:08,040
Which way is that?

542
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:11,249
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

543
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:12,837
Some believe the king choked.

544
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:15,300
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

545
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,935
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

546
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:22,091
The king was poisoned.

547
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,160
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

548
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,579
I did.
This is why I know.

549
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,034
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

550
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:34,077
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

551
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:37,844
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

552
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:39,289
Rather suspicious.

553
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:41,184
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

554
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,660
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

555
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,945
on the day that you arrived.

556
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:47,276
What did you discuss?

557
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,297
You think we conspired together?

558
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:50,732
What did you discuss?

559
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,027
The death of my sister.

560
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:55,748
For which you blame me.

561
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:57,940
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

562
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,780
The Mountain follows
your orders.

563
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:02,451
Of course I blame you.

564
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:04,869
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

565
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:06,558
Should I be concerned?

566
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:10,118
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

567
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:12,685
I am a man of reason.

568
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,698
If I cut your throat today,

569
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,432
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

570
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:18,488
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

571
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:20,324
without their
superiors' knowledge.

572
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:22,830
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

573
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:25,633
Categorically.

574
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:37,138
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

575
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,936
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

576
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:43,111
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

577
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,391
I could arrange
for this meeting.

578
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,148
But you want
something in return.

579
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:53,767
There will be a trial
for my son.

580
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,910
And as custom dictates,

581
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,795
three judges
will render a verdict.

582
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:00,290
I will preside.

583
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,395
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

584
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:05,751
I would like you
to be the third.

585
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,678
Why?

586
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,166
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

587
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:14,129
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

588
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:16,302
Now they are
our strongest allies.

589
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,528
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

590
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:22,220
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

591
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:26,123
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

592
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:29,841
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

593
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,102
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

594
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,764
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

595
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:47,536
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

596
00:38:47,663 --> 00:38:50,798
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

597
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:55,376
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

598
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:00,366
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

599
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,282
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

600
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,113
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

601
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:09,094
You're saying you need us?

602
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,158
That must be hard
for you to admit.

603
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:16,090
We need each other.

604
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:19,804
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

605
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,899
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

606
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:37,370
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

607
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,556
Podrick.

608
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,410
Apologies for the stench.

609
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:48,840
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

610
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:50,642
A noble effort.

611
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,952
They didn't find
the candles, though.

612
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:55,248
A quill, some parchment,

613
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,058
duck sausage, almonds,

614
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:01,159
and some hard cheese.

615
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,000
You're a good lad.

616
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:05,085
Any word of Shae?

617
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:06,700
I've heard nothing, my lord.

618
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:09,506
I suppose that's a good thing.

619
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:13,356
What are they saying
about me out there?

620
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,382
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

621
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:18,219
for murdering the king.

622
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,402
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

623
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:22,292
No, my lord.

624
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:24,155
You didn't?

625
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,838
No. Gods, no.

626
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,100
The world is a better
place without him,

627
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,345
but I had nothing to do with it.

628
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:33,430
I would like to think

629
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:35,541
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

630
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:38,071
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

631
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:41,242
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

632
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:45,254
Trial in a fortnight.

633
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:47,811
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

634
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,135
- Your father.
- Of course.

635
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,735
Mace Tyrell.

636
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:58,989
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

637
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,525
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

638
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,442
Oberyn?

639
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:05,773
Give it to my father.

640
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:08,537
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

641
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:11,813
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

642
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:14,848
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

643
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,330
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

644
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:18,923
<i>How generous of them.</i>

645
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,872
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

646
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,594
My lord, she's gone.

647
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:25,971
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

648
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:31,491
You don't think she...

649
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:38,338
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

650
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,334
but the girl is no assassin.

651
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,533
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

652
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:47,227
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

653
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:49,955
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

654
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:51,654
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

655
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:54,443
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

656
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:57,399
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

657
00:41:57,498 --> 00:42:00,793
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

658
00:42:00,908 --> 00:42:03,785
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

659
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:06,618
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

660
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:09,060
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

661
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:11,634
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

662
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:13,327
she loves her children.

663
00:42:13,383 --> 00:42:17,241
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

664
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:19,417
Which makes it unique

665
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:21,802
as King's Landing murders go.

666
00:42:21,883 --> 00:42:24,712
Any other witnesses, my lord?

667
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:26,899
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

668
00:42:26,972 --> 00:42:29,110
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

669
00:42:29,185 --> 00:42:31,515
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

670
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:32,914
I've already asked, my lord.

671
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,374
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

672
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:37,398
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

673
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:38,899
He's under
investigation himself.

674
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:42,325
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

675
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:44,993
I'll ask, my lord.

676
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,669
There's something else, my lord.

677
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,436
A man, I didn't know his face,

678
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,105
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

679
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,957
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

680
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,477
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

681
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:15,669
Ser Podrick Payne?

682
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:18,282
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

683
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:20,271
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

684
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,456
Are you going to
accept their offer?

685
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:25,295
My lord.

686
00:43:25,357 --> 00:43:27,413
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

687
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:28,931
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

688
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,702
they'll choose something
less sweet.

689
00:43:30,762 --> 00:43:32,096
You've been good to me, my lord.

690
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,585
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

691
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,279
They'll want an answer
before that.

692
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:38,635
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

693
00:43:39,877 --> 00:43:42,642
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

694
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,747
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

695
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:46,586
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

696
00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:49,138
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

697
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:52,277
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

698
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,682
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

699
00:43:56,794 --> 00:43:59,171
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

700
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:01,135
before it's too late.

701
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:02,775
Pod!

702
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:04,749
This is farewell.

703
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,825
Farewell, my lord.

704
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,649
<i>( door opens )</i>

705
00:44:14,308 --> 00:44:16,926
Pod.

706
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:22,667
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

707
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:31,397
<i>( door closes )</i>

708
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:48,301
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

709
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,571
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

710
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,531
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

711
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:56,569
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

712
00:44:56,673 --> 00:44:58,264
Has she got--

713
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,909
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

714
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,415
Guymon!

715
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,433
Hide.

716
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:07,539
Hide!

717
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:11,161
( screams )

718
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:13,612
( shouting, screaming )

719
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:55,028
( grunting )

720
00:45:58,051 --> 00:46:00,300
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

721
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:02,214
Yes. Yes.

722
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:11,779
Those your parents?

723
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:15,321
Open your eyes.

724
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:18,249
I'm going to eat them.

725
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,029
Do you hear me?

726
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:22,709
I'm going to eat your dead mama

727
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:26,256
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

728
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:29,962
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

729
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:41,163
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

730
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:42,501
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

731
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:44,233
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

732
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:46,381
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

733
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:48,542
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

734
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:51,267
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

735
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,498
They want to draw us out,

736
00:46:53,573 --> 00:46:55,822
pick us off a few at a time.

737
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:58,553
We have just over 100 men.

738
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:02,294
And that's including
stewards and builders.

739
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:05,798
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

740
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:09,821
We must remember our
first responsibility.

741
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:13,284
We are the watchers on the Wall.

742
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,369
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

743
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:20,429
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

744
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:23,437
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

745
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:29,873
Mance Rayder is coming.

746
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:33,826
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

747
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:36,721
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

748
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:41,842
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

749
00:47:42,017 --> 00:47:45,167
We need to shore up Castle Black

750
00:47:45,277 --> 00:47:48,620
and we need to defend the Wall.

751
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:51,171
<i>That is our job.</i>

752
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:54,913
<i>( horn blows )</i>

753
00:47:57,453 --> 00:47:59,120
Rangers returning.

754
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,054
Help him.

755
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:12,131
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

756
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:17,714
What took you so long?

757
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:19,626
- We were held up.
- By what?

758
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,025
Chains.

759
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:24,641
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

760
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:27,464
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

761
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:29,922
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

762
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:32,335
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

763
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,472
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

764
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,023
Karl's running things now.

765
00:48:36,075 --> 00:48:38,487
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

766
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,338
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

767
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,847
We just went over this, boy.

768
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:44,399
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

769
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:50,441
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

770
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:55,828
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

771
00:48:55,953 --> 00:48:58,411
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

772
00:48:58,497 --> 00:49:01,825
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

773
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:05,476
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

774
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,894
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

775
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:11,500
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

776
00:49:11,587 --> 00:49:14,883
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

777
00:49:14,998 --> 00:49:17,966
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

778
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,454
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

779
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:49,986

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

796
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:32,208
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

797
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:36,992
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

798
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,515
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

799
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:43,942
Do I have a champion?

800
00:51:44,058 --> 00:51:47,549

801
00:51:47,762 --> 00:51:49,747

802
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:51,885
_

803
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:53,893
_

804
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:57,446
Your Grace, I've won more single
combats than any man alive.

805
00:51:57,566 --> 00:51:59,729
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

806
00:51:59,805 --> 00:52:03,179
I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

807
00:52:03,297 --> 00:52:04,904
Let me stand for you
today as well.

808
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,856
You are my most trusted advisor,

809
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,848
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

810
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,719
I will not gamble
with your life.

811
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:14,078
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

812
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:16,489
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

813
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,770
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

814
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:20,743
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

815
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:23,480
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

816
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:27,338
Let me kill this man for you.

817
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:29,531
Very well.

818
00:52:29,578 --> 00:52:31,712
You have quite an audience.

819
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:34,136
Make it worth their while.

820
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,667
He is very brave, Your Grace.

821
00:52:37,782 --> 00:52:39,412
Yes, win or lose,

822
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:41,877
<i>as long as the whole</i>
<i>city is watching.</i>

823
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,214
You sure you don't want a horse?

824
00:54:39,272 --> 00:54:41,023
Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

825
00:54:41,084 --> 00:54:43,634
Horses are faster than men.

826
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:46,642
Horses are dumber than men.

827
00:54:46,744 --> 00:54:49,078
