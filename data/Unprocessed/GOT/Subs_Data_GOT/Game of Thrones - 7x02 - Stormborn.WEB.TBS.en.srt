1
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:05,580
The Lannisters have
declared war on house Tyrell.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,100
They have declared war on Dorne.

3
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:10,450
We must be allies now,
if we wish to survive.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,534
I offer vengeance... justice...

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:15,391
Fire and blood.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,241
I traveled south

7
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,991
under orders from the Lord Commander.

8
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,325
You ought to be a Maester.

9
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,740
Spending your life reading
about the achievements

10
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,141
of better men.

11
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:27,740
It's a map of Dragonstone.

12
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:28,866
That's dragonglass.

13
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:30,597
A mountain of it, beneath the ground.

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,100
Jon needs to know.

15
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:33,617
You must send me away.

16
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,782
I command you to heal yourself.

17
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:38,075
I command you to find the cure.

18
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,075
So why's a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

19
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:49,908
I'm going to kill the queen.

20
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,199
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,866
the new king of the Iron Islands.

22
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,741
The Iron Fleet is the greatest
armada Westeros has ever seen.

23
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:03,949
The surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,033
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

25
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,475
Shall we begin?

26
00:02:53,561 --> 00:03:03,865
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

27
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:41,699
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

28
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,990
I remember that storm.

29
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:45,740
All the dogs in King's Landing

30
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,740
howled through the night.

31
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,366
I wish I could remember it.

32
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:52,282
I always thought this
would be a homecoming.

33
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,074
Doesn't feel like home.

34
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,408
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

35
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,809
Good.

36
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:00,949
Not so many lions.

37
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,865
Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

38
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,157
The lords of Westeros despise her.

39
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,032
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

40
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,533
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

41
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:15,157
They drink secret toasts to my health?

42
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,116
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

43
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:19,158
and he was stupid
enough to believe them.

44
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,990
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

45
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,990
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

46
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:32,574
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

47
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,991
But you're not here to
be queen of the ashes.

48
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:37,740
No.

49
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,990
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

50
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,865
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

51
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,449
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

52
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,533
the game is won.

53
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,990
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

54
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:53,157
we have powerful allies in the south.

55
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,740
I never properly thanked you for that.

56
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:58,491
They joined our side, my queen,

57
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:01,032
because they believe in you.

58
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,367
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

59
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,990
I did.

60
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,324
And then you served the
man who overthrew him.

61
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:09,074
I had a choice, Your Grace...

62
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,199
serve Robert Baratheon or
face the headman's axe.

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,533
But you didn't serve him long.

64
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:14,991
You turned against him.

65
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,157
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

66
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:22,241
There have been few rulers in history

67
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,324
as cruel as the Mad King.

68
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,782
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

69
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:29,324
He simply had no interest in being king.

70
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,032
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

71
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,241
Your Grace,

72
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:37,241
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

73
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,282
Lord Varys told me about a
queen in the east who...

74
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:42,200
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

75
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,907
All your spies, your little birds,

76
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:50,575
did they tell you Viserys was
cruel, stupid, and weak?

77
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,199
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,865
Until your marriage to
Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

79
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,366
I knew nothing about
you, save your existence

80
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,699
and that you were said to be beautiful.

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,408
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

82
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,408
Which you turned to your advantage.

83
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,450
Who gave the order to kill me?

84
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,491
King Robert.

85
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:21,241
Who hired the assassins?

86
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,408
Who sent word to Essos to
murder Daenerys Targaryen?

87
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,183
Your Grace, I did what
had to be done to...

88
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,949
To keep yourself alive.

89
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,241
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

90
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:33,032
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

91
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,740
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

92
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,157
What kind of a servant is that?

93
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,282
The kind the realm needs.

94
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:44,658
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

95
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,617
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

96
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,324
I wasn't born into a great house.

97
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,907
I came from nothing.

98
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:56,865
I was sold as a slave and
carved up as an offering.

99
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,699
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

100
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,282
You wish to know where
my true loyalties lie?

101
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:06,491
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

102
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:10,449
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

103
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,825
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

104
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:18,533
If you demand blind allegiance,

105
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:21,282
I respect your wishes.

106
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:25,282
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

107
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:27,865
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

108
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:31,157
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

109
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,658
because I choose you.

110
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,200
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

111
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:47,659
Swear this to me, Varys.

112
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:52,616
If you ever think I'm
failing the people,

113
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,824
you won't conspire behind my back.

114
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,782
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

115
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:59,617
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

116
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,617
I swear it, my queen.

117
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,865
And I swear this... if
you ever betray me,

118
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,575
I'll burn you alive.

119
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:23,325
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

120
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,366
Forgive me, my queen.

121
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:31,534
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

122
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,700
_

123
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,638
_

124
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,468
_

125
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:53,472
_

126
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:56,696
_

127
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,768
_

128
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,398
_

129
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:05,217
_

130
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,321
_

131
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:11,616
She once served another who
wanted the Iron Throne.

132
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,533
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

133
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,199
No, it didn't.

134
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,032
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

135
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,907
We've just decided to pardon those

136
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:25,575
who once served the wrong king.

137
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:32,907
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

138
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:36,574
Not yet, but even those who
don't worship the Lord

139
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,074
can serve his cause.

140
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:39,991
What does your lord expect from me?

141
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:48,325
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

142
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,616
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

143
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,199
Your Grace, forgive me,

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,157
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

145
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,907
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

146
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:01,865
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

147
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:06,241
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

148
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,408
Doesn't really roll off
the tongue, does it?

149
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,950
No, but I like it better.

150
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,491
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

151
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,282
Prophecies are dangerous things.

152
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,616
I believe you have a role to play.

153
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:21,491
As does another...

154
00:10:21,492 --> 00:10:23,991
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

155
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,699
Jon Snow?

156
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,491
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

157
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:32,658
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

158
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,782
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

159
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,491
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

160
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:42,408
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

161
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,658
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

162
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,740
to protect them from grave danger.

163
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:48,324
As King in the North,

164
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:51,157
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

165
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:53,658
so together they may
face their common enemy.

166
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,782
He sounds like quite a man.

167
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,157
Summon Jon Snow.

168
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,824
Let him stand before you

169
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,449
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

170
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,075
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

171
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:08,241
I can't speak to prophecies

172
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,865
or visions in the flames,

173
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:13,658
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

174
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:16,157
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

175
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,616
If he does rule the North,

176
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,367
he would make a valuable ally.

177
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,616
The Lannisters executed his father

178
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,782
and conspired to murder his brother.

179
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:28,991
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

180
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,157
Very well.

181
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:36,949
Send a raven north.

182
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,949
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

183
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,949
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

184
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,700
and bend the knee.

185
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:56,241
Gather round. Come here.

186
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:58,740
You think it's really Tyrion?

187
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:02,241
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

188
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,782
Read the last bit.

189
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:08,408
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

190
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:10,157
What does that mean?

191
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:13,075
It's something he said to
me the first night we met.

192
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,242
You know him better than any of us.

193
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,809
What do you think?

194
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,491
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

195
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:28,282
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

196
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,282
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

197
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,782
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

198
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:33,949
Join us.

199
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,783
Together, we can end her tyranny."

200
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,949
Sounds like a charmer.

201
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,157
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

202
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:47,116
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

203
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:48,659
a bit less charming.

204
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:51,824
What?

205
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:55,074
Fire kills wights, you told me.

206
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,475
What breathes fire?

207
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,449
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

208
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,865
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

209
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,824
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

210
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:08,325
do we have enough men to fight them?

211
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,032
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

212
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,950
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

213
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:21,199
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,324
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

215
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:27,533
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

216
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:31,032
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

217
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,824
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

218
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:38,990
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

219
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,199
rape and enslave your women,

220
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,116
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

221
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:48,990
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

222
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,824
You all remember the Mad King.

223
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:55,366
You remember the horrors he
inflicted upon his people.

224
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,366
His daughter is no different.

225
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,157
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

226
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:04,449
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

227
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,116
And when she grew bored of that,

228
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,366
she fed them to her dragons.

229
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:12,949
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

230
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,116
But I need your help, my lords.

231
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:18,908
We must stand together, all of us...

232
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:22,116
if we hope to stop her.

233
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,534
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

234
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,699
The same as Aegon when he conquered

235
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,199
the Seven Kingdoms.

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,575
How do you propose to stop them?

237
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:46,367
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

238
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,642
Lord Tarly.

239
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,990
Ser Jaime.

240
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:59,699
I believe you know my son.

241
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Ser Jaime.

242
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,199
Rickard, isn't it?

243
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,907
Dickon.

244
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:05,449
That's it.

245
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,449
Thank you for coming.

246
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,366
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

247
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,074
They might not have come if you hadn't.

248
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:16,366
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

249
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,158
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

250
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,408
You ride for Horn Hill today?

251
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:27,116
I have an army to mobilize.

252
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:29,449
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

253
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,908
And which side will you be fighting for?

254
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,241
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

255
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:38,157
Not even Rhaegar
Targaryen could do that.

256
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:41,116
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

257
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:44,074
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

258
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,199
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

259
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,199
and I want you to help
me destroy her enemies.

260
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,032
All her enemies.

261
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,075
Including Olenna Tyrell.

262
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:58,324
I'm a Tarly.

263
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,825
That name means something.

264
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,865
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

265
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:06,324
We don't stab our rivals in the back

266
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,158
or cut their throats at weddings.

267
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,199
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

268
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,534
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

269
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,324
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

270
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,949
She was a great woman once.

271
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,324
Now she's broken.

272
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,449
She wants revenge so badly,

273
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,699
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

274
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,617
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

275
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,533
I know you don't like my sister,

276
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,699
but you have to make a choice.

277
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,740
Do you fight with us

278
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,866
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

279
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:54,366
When the war is won,

280
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,533
the queen will need a new
Warden of the South.

281
00:16:57,534 --> 00:17:00,366
I can think of no better man

282
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,200
than Randyll Tarly.

283
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:07,032
The infection
has spread too far.

284
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,991
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

285
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,100
How long?

286
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,699
It'll be years before it kills you.

287
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,282
Could be 10.

288
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:21,949
Could be 20.

289
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,700
But how long until...?

290
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,199
Your mind?

291
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,075
Six months, maybe fewer.

292
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:44,141
Um...

293
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,574
Pardon, Archmaester.

294
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,574
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

295
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:54,032
She had the greyscale as
a baby and was cured.

296
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,616
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

297
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,408
Does this look
like a baby to you?

298
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,740
- No.
- Have you studied

299
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:00,782
the varying rates of
greyscale progression

300
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,409
in infants and fully grown men?

301
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,850
No.

302
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,199
Maester Cressen discovered

303
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,783
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

304
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,950
This is quite advanced.

305
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,991
And beyond our skills, ser.

306
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,408
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

307
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,949
to live out your life
with the stone men.

308
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,783
As an anointed knight, I'll
allow you one more day.

309
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:37,117
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

310
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,017
Come, Samwell.

311
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:51,367
Should we send word to
your family, Ser...?

312
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:54,391
Jorah.

313
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:58,324
Jorah Mormont.

314
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,366
Mormont?

315
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,116
There's no need.

316
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,700
I've been dead to them for years.

317
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,033
Come, Samwell!

318
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,907
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

319
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:25,409
No, I can't say I have.

320
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,116
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

321
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:35,074
Curious that King Robert did
not have them destroyed.

322
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:37,241
They were his trophies.

323
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,449
He couldn't keep them around.

324
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,366
They would have made him look small.

325
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:43,908
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

326
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,075
I believe he brought his
whores on occasion.

327
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,200
Balerion the Dread.

328
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,616
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

329
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,533
His flames forged the Iron Throne

330
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,409
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

331
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,975
Powerful...

332
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,283
but not invincible.

333
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:21,074
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

334
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:24,741
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

335
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,574
And if they can be wounded,

336
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,975
they can be killed.

337
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:35,241
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

338
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:38,075
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

339
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:47,117
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

340
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,117
If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

341
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,282
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

342
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,949
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

343
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,449
The city will fall within a day.

344
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,366
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

345
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,949
It's called war.

346
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,949
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

347
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,282
I know how you wage war.

348
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:29,032
We don't poison little girls here.

349
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,324
Myrcella was innocent.

350
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:31,699
She was a Lannister.

351
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,324
There are no innocent Lannisters.

352
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,616
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

353
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:39,491
That's enough.

354
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,074
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

355
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:42,492
You will treat him with respect.

356
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,492
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

357
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,907
That's very nice to hear.

358
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:54,865
Of course, I can't remember a queen

359
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:57,824
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

360
00:21:57,825 --> 00:21:59,782
The common people loved her.

361
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,533
The nobles loved her.

362
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:03,282
And what is left of her now?

363
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:06,116
Ashes.

364
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,824
Commoners, nobles,

365
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,699
they're all just children, really.

366
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,325
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

367
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,574
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

368
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:19,491
I'm grateful to all of you.

369
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:22,116
But you have chosen to follow me.

370
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:24,491
I will not attack King's Landing.

371
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:27,324
We will not attack King's Landing.

372
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:30,990
Then how do you mean to
take the Iron Throne?

373
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:32,391
By asking nicely?

374
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,865
We will lay siege to the capital,

375
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,574
surrounding the city on all sides.

376
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,366
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

377
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,740
but no food for her army or the people.

378
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,658
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

379
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:46,699
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

380
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,366
by appealing to their loyalty,

381
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,032
their love for their country.

382
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:51,949
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

383
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,658
we prove her point.

384
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,282
Our army should be Westerosi.

385
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:57,574
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

386
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,865
You are.

387
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:02,242
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

388
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:08,241
And her Iron Fleet will
ferry the Dornish army

389
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:10,241
back up to King's Landing.

390
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:13,074
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

391
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,116
alongside the Tyrell army.

392
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:17,782
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

393
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:22,907
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

394
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:26,283
Forgive me for asking, but why did
you bother to bring your own?

395
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,782
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

396
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:34,366
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

397
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:38,533
And the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

398
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,449
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

399
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,325
will sail for the Rock and take it.

400
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,492
Do I have your support?

401
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:06,683
You have mine.

402
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,325
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

403
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:15,991
Thank you all.

404
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,325
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

405
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:32,699
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

406
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,616
But I swear to you, she will
pay for what she's done.

407
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:39,282
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

408
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:41,324
Peace?

409
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:43,990
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

410
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:47,116
Or his father? Or his?

411
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,782
Peace never lasts, my dear.

412
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,117
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

413
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,116
He's a clever man, your Hand.

414
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:59,949
I've known a great many clever men.

415
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,865
I've outlived them all.

416
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,782
You know why?

417
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,324
I ignored them.

418
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:08,824
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

419
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,225
Are you a sheep?

420
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,533
No.

421
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:15,824
You're a dragon.

422
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:17,367
Be a dragon.

423
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,699
Mají.

424
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:29,825
You leave tomorrow.

425
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:35,074
Were you going to say goodbye?

426
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,699
I will see you when I return.

427
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,575
But you don't know when that will be.

428
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,975
No one knows.

429
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,409
I wish you good fortune.

430
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,308
Missandei.

431
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,907
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

432
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:03,116
Why?

433
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:04,782
You know why.

434
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:06,183
I don't.

435
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:12,534
Y-you are my weakness.

436
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,990
That's what I am?

437
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,449
Your weakness?

438
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,158
When Unsullied are young, the
masters learn their fears.

439
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:25,116
One boy is scared of dogs,

440
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,990
one boy hates high places,

441
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,824
one is frightened of the ocean.

442
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,282
They make the boy sleep with dogs

443
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:34,199
or climb a cliff.

444
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,491
They throw him in the water.

445
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:38,782
If he learns to swim, good.

446
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:40,741
If he drowns, good.

447
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,949
Either way, strong Unsullied.

448
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,366
But I had no fears.

449
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:51,158
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

450
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,825
but I was bravest, always.

451
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,241
- I believe it.
- Until...

452
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,033
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

453
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:07,825
Now I have fear.

454
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,850
I do, too.

455
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,866
No.

456
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,075
I want to see you.

457
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,850
Please.

458
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:11,782
Might be useful.

459
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:13,658
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,

460
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:15,491
but an excellent researcher.

461
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:17,949
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

462
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,824
Maester Faull was quite the opposite...

463
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:22,574
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

464
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,199
Um, I wanted to ask you...

465
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,990
If you're going to write
histories, Tarly,

466
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,574
you have to do the research.

467
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,449
If you want people to
read your histories,

468
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,699
you need a bit of style.

469
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,699
I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars

470
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,533
Following the Death of King Robert I"

471
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,825
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

472
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:42,659
What? You don't like the title?

473
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,199
What would you call it, then?

474
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,533
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

475
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:51,282
We're not poets, Tarly.

476
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,449
Um, Archmaester, if I
could just have a moment.

477
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,199
This is your moment.

478
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,659
Use it wisely.

479
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,659
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

480
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,032
There are two recorded cases

481
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,865
of advanced greyscale being cured.

482
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,699
I found the procedure in
the study of rare diseases

483
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,032
by Archmaester Pylos.

484
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,199
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos

485
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,157
and his study of rare diseases.

486
00:31:13,158 --> 00:31:15,157
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

487
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:17,075
And shall I tell you how he died?

488
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,642
From greyscale.

489
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,241
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

490
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:24,642
which is why it's now forbidden.

491
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:10,241
Hello.

492
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,783
What are you doing?

493
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:16,324
You're Jorah Mormont,

494
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,283
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

495
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:21,408
My name is Samwell Tarly,

496
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,199
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,

497
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,990
training to serve as
maester at Castle Black.

498
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:27,282
I knew your father.

499
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:28,783
I was with him when he died.

500
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:36,991
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

501
00:32:42,991 --> 00:32:44,616
Drink this.

502
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:46,408
- What is it?
- Rum.

503
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:48,569
Drink it all, please. I'm
afraid this is going to hurt.

504
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,659
If you could take off your shirt.

505
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,534
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

506
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,990
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

507
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:34,231
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

508
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:39,700
Have you ever done this before?

509
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,558
No.

510
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:52,409
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

511
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,367
Have a seat.

512
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:04,282
I'm going to have to remove the entire
upper layer of infected tissue,

513
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:06,575
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

514
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:22,408
Shh, shh!

515
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,658
Shh.

516
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,074
Again, I'm sorry,

517
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:29,575
but please try not to scream.

518
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:30,907
They say her dragons are
bigger than Aegon's.

519
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:33,658
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

520
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:35,241
I hope it's true.

521
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:38,282
If she lays siege to King's
Landing, prices will triple.

522
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:41,658
As long as we get back
there before they start.

523
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,200
One more round. It's a long ride.

524
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:47,658
Arry!

525
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,059
Hello, Hot Pie.

526
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:51,558
Sit down.

527
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,017
Who's that for?

528
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:05,367
Mm. This is good.

529
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,824
You think so?

530
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:11,574
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

531
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,533
Most people don't do that 'cause
it takes up too much time.

532
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:16,157
Mm, I didn't do that.

533
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:17,699
You've been making pies?

534
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,032
One or two.

535
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:22,032
I can't believe you're here.

536
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:24,491
Did you meet the big lady?

537
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:27,491
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

538
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:29,699
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

539
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,533
She was looking for your sister,
but I told her about you.

540
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,033
Did she ever find you?

541
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,017
She found me.

542
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:44,683
What happened to you, Arry?

543
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,433
You got any ale?

544
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,574
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

545
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:16,074
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

546
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,658
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

547
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,241
That must have been something to see.

548
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:21,032
- Boom.
- Mm.

549
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,241
I can't believe someone would do that.

550
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,783
Cersei would do that.

551
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,990
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

552
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,116
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

553
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,575
No, the Boltons are dead.

554
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:37,949
What?

555
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,116
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

556
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:41,907
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

557
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:43,325
He's King of the North now.

558
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,116
You're lying.

559
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:47,990
Why would I lie about that?

560
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,450
He's your brother, right?

561
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,782
Thanks for the pie.

562
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:00,699
Friends don't pay.

563
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,990
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

564
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,908
You're pretty.

565
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,517
Thanks.

566
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,534
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

567
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,324
Try not to get killed.

568
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:18,740
Ah, I won't.

569
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:19,990
I'm like you, Arry.

570
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:21,659
I'm a survivor.

571
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:27,991
200 miles to King's Landing.

572
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:31,659
One bottle of rum. You
think we'll make it?

573
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:07,408
Come in.

574
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:10,866
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

575
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,408
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

576
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:26,740
He was my brother at the Night's Watch,

577
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:31,282
a man I trust as much as
anyone in this world.

578
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:34,074
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone

579
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,907
sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

580
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:45,241
I received this a few days ago

581
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:46,866
from Dragonstone.

582
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:50,865
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

583
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:56,241
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

584
00:39:56,242 --> 00:40:00,282
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

585
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,199
She has a powerful army at her back

586
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,074
and, if this message is to be believed,

587
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:07,366
three dragons.

588
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,116
Lord Tyrion has
invited me to Dragonstone

589
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:13,866
to meet with Daenerys.

590
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,616
And I'm going to accept.

591
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,017
Accept?!

592
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:24,408
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

593
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,366
We know that dragonglass can destroy

594
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,282
both white walkers and their army.

595
00:40:28,283 --> 00:40:31,825
We need to mine it and
turn it into weapons.

596
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:35,199
But more importantly, we need allies!

597
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,491
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

598
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,241
We can't defeat them on our own.

599
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,074
We don't have the numbers.

600
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:46,782
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

601
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:50,074
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

602
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:53,199
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

603
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,616
then sail for Dragonstone.

604
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:58,533
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

605
00:40:58,534 --> 00:41:00,740
The Mad King invited
him to King's Landing

606
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:03,032
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

607
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:06,157
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

608
00:41:06,158 --> 00:41:08,157
The North is one of
those seven kingdoms.

609
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:10,990
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

610
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:14,282
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

611
00:41:14,283 --> 00:41:16,658
You know him. He's a good man.

612
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:20,491
Your Grace, with respect, I
must agree with Lady Sansa.

613
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:23,574
I remember the Mad King all too well.

614
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:26,324
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

615
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,533
- Nor can a Lannister.
- Yeah!

616
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:31,990
Aye. We called your brother king.

617
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,907
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

618
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:39,699
Winter is here, Your Grace.

619
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,574
We need the King in the
North in the North.

620
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:45,908
Aye!

621
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:56,659
You all crowned me your king.

622
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:00,865
I never wanted it.

623
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:03,324
I never asked for it.

624
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:07,616
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

625
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:11,907
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

626
00:42:11,908 --> 00:42:13,325
no matter the odds.

627
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,991
But the odds are against us.

628
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:24,199
None of you have seen the Army
of the Dead. None of you.

629
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,241
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

630
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:31,242
We need allies, powerful allies.

631
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:36,075
I know it's a risk.

632
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,282
But I have to take it.

633
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:42,032
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

634
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:43,574
Daenerys is a queen.

635
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:45,907
Only a king can convince her to help us.

636
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:47,699
It has to be me.

637
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,658
You're abandoning your people!

638
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:51,449
You're abandoning your home.

639
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,366
I'm leaving both in good hands.

640
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:54,783
- Whose?
- Yours.

641
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,282
You are my sister.

642
00:42:58,283 --> 00:43:00,366
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

643
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:04,283
Until I return, the North is yours.

644
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,409
I delivered his bones myself.

645
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,574
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

646
00:43:32,575 --> 00:43:35,075
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

647
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:37,908
Seems like a lifetime ago.

648
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,242
Do give Lord Tyrion my
best when you see him.

649
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,616
I was sorry when he died.

650
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:51,325
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

651
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:55,534
So did I.

652
00:43:57,825 --> 00:43:59,991
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

653
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:04,950
Well, it appears she
vastly underestimated you.

654
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:08,408
Your father and brothers are gone,

655
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:10,450
yet here you stand, King in the North.

656
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:14,158
Last best hope against the coming storm.

657
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,325
You don't belong down here.

658
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,117
Forgive me.

659
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:29,366
We haven't ever talked... properly.

660
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,866
I wanted to remedy that.

661
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,033
I have nothing to say to you.

662
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:38,116
Not even "thank you"?

663
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:42,366
If it weren't for me, you'd have been
slaughtered on that battlefield.

664
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,741
You have many enemies, my king, but I
swear to you, I'm not one of them.

665
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:50,408
I love Sansa,

666
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:52,074
as I loved her mother.

667
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,908
Touch my sister, and
I'll kill you myself.

668
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:33,534
- Ready?
- Ready?

669
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,600
Ready!

670
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,475
Come on.

671
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,950
- Yah!
- Come on!

672
00:47:38,242 --> 00:47:39,865
Nymeria?

673
00:47:54,242 --> 00:47:57,575
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

674
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:04,908
I'm heading north, girl.

675
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:09,950
Back to Winterfell. I'm
finally going home.

676
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:14,892
Come with me.

677
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,367
Come with me.

678
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:56,117
That's not you.

679
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,949
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

680
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,366
I'm oldest.

681
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,491
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

682
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:20,491
She's not my mama.

683
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:22,574
You can have Cersei.

684
00:49:22,575 --> 00:49:25,116
I want the Mountain.

685
00:49:25,117 --> 00:49:27,241
The Mountain killed Father.

686
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:28,990
He'll crush you with one hand.

687
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:31,740
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

688
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:33,949
Will you shut up about Mama?

689
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,533
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

690
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:39,408
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

691
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,950
And then I won't have to share.

692
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,850
"Mama!"

693
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,658
How can you drink this piss?

694
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,782
When we reach Sunspear,

695
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:53,324
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

696
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:55,740
The best in the world.

697
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:57,157
Have you ever been to Dorne?

698
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:59,157
A few times.

699
00:49:59,158 --> 00:50:00,533
Never stayed long.

700
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:02,075
A boy in every port?

701
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,659
A boy, a girl.

702
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,600
Depends on the port.

703
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:13,409
Could we get some more?

704
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,574
I thought it wasn't for you.

705
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:18,866
I'm developing a taste for it.

706
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:22,659
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

707
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:29,366
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

708
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:31,199
Once I kill my uncle.

709
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,658
And what will you be, handsome?

710
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,366
Whatever my queen commands.

711
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:39,199
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

712
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,449
Oh, I see.

713
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,866
Your protector.

714
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:47,157
So, if someone gets too close to you...

715
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:48,949
He might have to intervene.

716
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,740
To hold that person back.

717
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:53,409
Until they've made their
intentions known.

718
00:50:56,783 --> 00:50:58,743
Why are you standing all
the way over there, then?

719
00:51:00,242 --> 00:51:02,324
A foreign invasion is underway.

720
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,075
Leave him be.

721
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:09,450
Seems like you don't need a protector.

722
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,642
Stay here.

723
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,325
We're under attack!

724
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:46,075
Euron.

725
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:56,325
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

726
00:53:48,242 --> 00:53:49,907
Aah!

727
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,141
Yah!

728
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:11,892
Aah!

729
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:31,059
Yah!

730
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,850
Yah!

731
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,491
Kill us.

732
00:54:53,492 --> 00:54:54,950
Get it over with.

733
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,158
Give your uncle a kiss.

734
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,908
Little Theon!

735
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:16,908
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

736
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:22,658
I have her.

737
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,242
Come and get her.

738
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:09,093
