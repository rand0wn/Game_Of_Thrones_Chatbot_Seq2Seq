1
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,291
Here we are.

2
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,218
Ready?

3
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,392
"The Rains of Castamere."

4
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,477
You fucking deaf?

5
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,813
Same wrong guess
every fucking time.

6
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,231
Listen, you cunt.

7
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,450
Oh!

8
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:16,371
"The Bear
and the Maiden Fair."

9
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:20,075
There's a man
with an ear.

10
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,527
Too bad you got
a hangnail for a cock.

11
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,465
First time I saw you
with your breeches down,

12
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,166
I thought you were
a eunuch.

13
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,719
You've seen it, girls.

14
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:33,672
Like a baby snail
peeking out of his shell.

15
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,105
Your baby was crying
this morning.

16
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,030
Woke me up.

17
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,748
You hear me?

18
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:01,249
Yes.

19
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:03,702
Well, got
anything to say?

20
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,737
I'm sorry
he woke you up.

21
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,924
I don't care
if you're sorry.

22
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,710
Keep that baby quiet

23
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,512
or I will.

24
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,097
Don't you
ever touch him.

25
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,417
Little wildling bitch.

26
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:22,471
<i>You should have stayed</i>
<i>with your own kind.</i>

27
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,274
<i>You listening to me?</i>

28
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,310
- Shut your mouth.
- What?

29
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,198
It's just an owl,
you dumb bitch.

30
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,484
No, it's not.

31
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,667
- - Shh.

32
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,377
I should never
have left her there.

33
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,014
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've known.

34
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,566
They've been raiding
the villages close by.

35
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,402
And we just cower in here while
they slaughter our brothers.

36
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,238
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

37
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,857
So it's all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs

38
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,742
and Mully chopped to pieces
'cause they broke the rules?

39
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,277
<i>I didn't say it</i>
<i>was all right.</i>

40
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,995
I'm saying they shouldn't
have been there.

41
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,531
We're pledged to guard
the realms of men.

42
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,033
She's dead because of me.

43
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,584
We can't even guard
Mole's Town.

44
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,203
We can't go after them.
You know that.

45
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:52,704
It's what they want.

46
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,073
And little Sam.

47
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,093
As if I cut
their throats myself.

48
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,461
Maybe she managed
to hide herself.

49
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,412
<i>I thought</i>
<i>all of you was dead.</i>

50
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,715
You went north with Mormont
and no one came back.

51
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,800
Not for ages.

52
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,719
But then you did.

53
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,106
She survived Craster

54
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,692
and he was the worst
shit I've ever met.

55
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,393
She survived the long march
to the Wall.

56
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:19,231
<i>She survived a white walker,</i>
<i>for fuck's sake.</i>

57
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,950
She might have got out.

58
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,705
She might have.

59
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,408
If they hit Mole's Town,

60
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,494
then we're next.

61
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,499
Mance and his army
must be close.

62
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,217
<i>100,000 of them.</i>

63
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,753
And there's what,
105 of us left?

64
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,422
You counting Black Jack,
Kegs, and Mully?

65
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,592
102.

66
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:50,762
How do 102 men
stop 100,000?

67
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,302
Whoever dies last,
be a good lad

68
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,771
<i>and burn the rest of us.</i>

69
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,407
Once I'm done
with this world,

70
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,910
I don't want
to come back.

71
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,672
<i>You think he was</i>
<i>spying on you?</i>

72
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,307
<i>No, not spying.</i>

73
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,593
<i>The Dothraki think</i>
<i>outsiders are ridiculous</i>

74
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,094
taking shame
in the naked body.

75
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,481
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

76
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,185
Yes, Your Grace.

77
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,520
But you are not
Dothraki.

78
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,522
No.

79
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,859
Well, I don't see
why it matters.

80
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,160
Grey Worm
isn't interested.

81
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,663
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

82
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,035
He was interested.

83
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,621
What?

84
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:44,125
I believe he was
interested.

85
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,013
When the slavers
castrate the boys,

86
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,764
do they take all of it?

87
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,883
All of it?

88
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,852
The--

89
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,638
the pillar
and the stones.

90
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,393
I don't know,
Your Grace.

91
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,145
Haven't you
ever wondered?

92
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,984
Yes, Your Grace.

93
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,337
<i>Missandei.</i>

94
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,806
The lessons you give I
in common tongue...

95
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,660
these are precious to I.

96
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,946
- To me.
- To me.

97
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,149
I don't remember teaching
you the word precious.

98
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,252
Jorah the Andal,
he teaches I--

99
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,089
he teaches me
this word.

100
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,792
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

101
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,628
I remember nothing.

102
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:12,514
Only Unsullied.

103
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:14,549
When they cut you,

104
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,018
do you remember that?

105
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:21,439
I'm sorry.

106
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,691
I'm sorry they did
that to you.

107
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:26,444
Why?
Why sorry?

108
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,147
It's a terrible thing
to do to a boy.

109
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,738
If the masters
never cut me,

110
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,873
I never am Unsullied.

111
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:42,043
I never stand in
the Plaza of Pride

112
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,662
when Daenerys Stormborn
orders us

113
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,581
to kill the masters.

114
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:50,401
I never am chosen
to lead the Unsullied.

115
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,703
I never meet Missandei

116
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,006
from the island of Naath.

117
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,992
I am sorry I--

118
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,529
for today.

119
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,697
I am sorry.

120
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,712
Kraken. Mmm.

121
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,381
Strong as long
as they're in the sea.

122
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,117
When you take them
out of the water,

123
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,452
no bones.

124
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,671
They collapse
under their proud weight

125
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,090
and slump into
a heap of nothing.

126
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,342
You'd think
they know that.

127
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,978
Unfortunately,
they're not very bright.

128
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,482
What do you tell them?

129
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,767
I'm Theon Greyjoy,

130
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:32,570
son of Balon,
heir to the Iron Islands.

131
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,806
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

132
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,825
Are you sure?

133
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,746
You do look very much
like a lord.

134
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,033
Formidable, proud.

135
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,619
I'm Reek.

136
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:49,504
Until when?

137
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:51,589
Always.

138
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,841
- Forever.
- That's right.

139
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:57,262
Until you're rotting
in the ground.

140
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:03,885
Remember what you are
and what you're not.

141
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,354
Bring me Moat Cailin.

142
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,419
No closer.

143
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:43,091
Who are you?

144
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,715
I'm Kenning,

145
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,967
commander of
this garrison.

146
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,771
And you say
you're Theon Greyjoy?

147
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,723
Yes.

148
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,809
And why should
I believe that?

149
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,862
I was born on Pyke
to Balon Greyjoy.

150
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,615
His third
and last living son.

151
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,367
I am your prince.

152
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,619
I swear it
by the Drowned God.

153
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,988
What is dead
may never die.

154
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,073
What is dead
may never die.

155
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,376
And if you were
my prince,

156
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,711
why are you marching
with a Bolton army?

157
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,297
Lord Bolton took me
captive after Winterfell.

158
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,300
He sent me to treat
with you in good faith

159
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,752
as your fellow ironborn.

160
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,637
And what does
Lord Bolton want?

161
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,642
You are fading
from sickness,

162
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,143
you are badly outnumbered,

163
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,479
and you're hundreds
of miles from the sea.

164
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:13,431
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men

165
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,984
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

166
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,438
Do this, and he will be
just and fair with you

167
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,407
as he has been with me.

168
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:27,361
The Boltons will give you safe
passage to the Stony Shore.

169
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,614
He wants us
to surrender?

170
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,366
My own father,
your king,

171
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,703
surrendered years ago
to Robert Baratheon.

172
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,005
I watched him
bend the knee.

173
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,624
There was no shame there.

174
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,343
He fought with honor,
as did you.

175
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,683
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

176
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:50,601
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear.

177
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,523
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

178
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,813
Only a whipped dog
would speak this way.

179
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,566
Or a woman.

180
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,820
Are you a woman, boy?

181
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,321
You don't know--

182
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,657
The ironborn
will not surrender.

183
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,375
Reek. My name is Reek...

184
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,694
You go tell
your master that,

185
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:18,996
Theon Greyjoy,

186
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,031
or whoever the fuck
you are.

187
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,717
My name is Reek.

188
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,385
What in the hell
are you muttering?

189
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,304
I'm Reek.

190
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,223
Reek.

191
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,899
If we yield, we live?

192
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,901
Is that what it says
on this paper here?

193
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:44,221
Yes. Have your men raise the
white flag and open the gates.

194
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,657
You're going home.

195
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,900
<i>- You didn't really think</i>
<i>- I'd let them go, did you?</i>

196
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:59,670
It's fallen out
of fashion, flaying.

197
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,923
Sad, but true.

198
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,958
Traditions
are important.

199
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,294
Where are we
without our history?

200
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,796
- Eh?
- Yes, my lord.

201
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,382
Will we go home now?

202
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,552
I believe we will.

203
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,554
To our new home.

204
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,700
<i>You have foreign blood,</i>
<i>don't you, Baelish?</i>

205
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,237
A great-grandfather
from Braavos, yes.

206
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,823
I suppose
all of our ancestors

207
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,825
came from somewhere
else originally.

208
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,077
<i>Our forebearers</i>
<i>settled the Vale</i>

209
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,546
<i>thousands of years ago.</i>

210
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,081
<i>We've fought off invaders</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

211
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,616
The beauty of the Vale
is matched only

212
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,002
by the nobility
of its great families.

213
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,137
Lady Arryn often told me

214
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,790
that you were her rock,
Lord Royce.

215
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,610
She told me nothing
about you, Baelish.

216
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:58,379
But I didn't need
to hear from her.

217
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,548
Moneylender.
Whoremonger.

218
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,584
You've been licking Tywin
Lannister's boots so long,

219
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,570
- It's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord--

220
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,407
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

221
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,325
Always been a grubby job.

222
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,578
Why not let
a grubby man do it?

223
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,180
<i>But when I heard</i>
<i>you were lurking here,</i>

224
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,049
fawning over
the Lady Arryn--

225
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,167
Lady Arryn
invited me.

226
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,954
She and I have been
close since childhood.

227
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,539
Yes, we all know
how close you were.

228
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,392
<i>Lady Arryn's predilections</i>
<i>were her own affair.</i>

229
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,044
Her death is our affair.

230
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,847
Of course. Her suicide
shattered us all.

231
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,266
She was an odd fish.

232
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,019
Everyone knew that.
But suicide?

233
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:41,522
<i>She adored</i>
<i>that boy of hers.</i>

234
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,941
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

235
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,111
<i>Strange that within days</i>
<i>of your arrival,</i>

236
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,482
you've married Lady Arryn and she's
fallen through the Moon Door.

237
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,567
She was always prone
to melancholy.

238
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,121
My lady wasn't meant for a
world as brutal as ours.

239
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,206
We were told there was a witness.
A girl.

240
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,575
A niece of yours,
I believe.

241
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:06,030
A girl with no learning
and scattered wits.

242
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,364
I assure you,
she would be of no help.

243
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,500
We'd like
to speak with her.

244
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,888
- Let me fetch her.
<i>- No need.</i>

245
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:18,175
We prefer to hear her
testimony unadulterated.

246
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,770
<i>Come closer, child.</i>

247
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,223
You have nothing
to fear from us or him.

248
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,744
<i>Lord Baelish here</i>
<i>is your uncle?</i>

249
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,163
<i>Your name is Alayne?</i>

250
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,068
<i>Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.</i>

251
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,870
- My lady--
- I wasn't asking you.

252
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,090
- He can stay. - Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

253
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,208
Tell us what you saw.

254
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,597
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

255
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,516
I have to tell the truth.

256
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:05,473
I'll tell you
everything.

257
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,944
Please, Alayne,
leave nothing out.

258
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:14,065
My name is not Alayne.

259
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,567
It's Sansa Stark,

260
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,236
eldest daughter
of Lord Eddard Stark.

261
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,939
Lord Royce, we met when
you came to Winterfell.

262
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:24,775
You were escorting your son
Ser Waymar to the Wall.

263
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,995
Sansa Stark?

264
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,248
You tell lies right to my
face, you little worm?

265
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,468
Lord Baelish
has told many lies.

266
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,256
All to protect me.

267
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,560
<i>Since my father</i>
<i>was executed,</i>

268
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,479
I have been a hostage
in King's Landing.

269
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:48,315
A plaything for Joffrey
to torture

270
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,518
or Queen Cersei
to torment.

271
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,187
They beat me,
they humiliated me,

272
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,107
they married me
to the Imp.

273
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,993
I had no friends
in King's Landing...

274
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,863
except one.

275
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:11,122
He saved me.

276
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:14,542
Smuggled me away
when he had the chance.

277
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:18,512
He knew I'd be safe
here in the Eyrie

278
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,182
with my own blood,
my Aunt Lysa.

279
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,770
The Lannisters have
friends everywhere.

280
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,054
<i>Even the Vale.</i>

281
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,307
<i>He made me swear not to
tell anyone my true name.</i>

282
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:33,144
Your secret is safe
with us, my lady.

283
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,780
<i>Your father grew up</i>
<i>right here in these halls.</i>

284
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,015
We hunted together
many times.

285
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,483
He was a fine man.

286
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:44,205
Tell us what happened
to your aunt, Sansa.

287
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,210
You knew her well,
my lords, my lady.

288
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:51,579
You knew she was
a troubled woman.

289
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,415
She always loved
Lord Baelish.

290
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,200
She told me herself.

291
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,719
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

292
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:03,474
a boy of eight carrying everything
he owned in a little sack.

293
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,978
<i>She confessed to me</i>
<i>she never loved Lord Arryn.</i>

294
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,499
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

295
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,552
<i>When the gods finally allowed</i>
<i>her to be with Lord Baelish,</i>

296
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,238
she was so happy.

297
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:18,722
For a time.

298
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,860
My aunt
was a jealous lady.

299
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:27,665
She was terrified
that Lord Baelish

300
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,949
didn't love her
anymore.

301
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,535
That he would abandon
her for a younger woman.

302
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,007
And then...

303
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,377
one day she saw
him kiss me.

304
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:42,046
Lady Sansa.

305
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:45,216
It was a peck on the cheek,
Lord Royce, nothing more.

306
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,886
Lord Baelish is my uncle
now, in truth, by marriage.

307
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,889
He's always been
so kind to me.

308
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,775
I was so happy to be here,
to be free.

309
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,944
All because of him.

310
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:59,230
But my aunt
turned on me.

311
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,616
She cursed me.
Called me a whore.

312
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,369
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

313
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,821
When Lord Baelish tried
to calm her,

314
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,707
she struck him.

315
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,441
She said she didn't want
to live anymore.

316
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,577
<i>She stood on the edge</i>
<i>of that Moon Door.</i>

317
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,379
He tried
to reason with her.

318
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,915
Promised her she was the
only one he had ever loved,

319
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:22,586
but she stepped through
those doors and she was--

320
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,957
Shh.

321
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:30,811
Shh, it's not your fault,
sweet girl.

322
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,402
It's not
your fault.

323
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,953
You could see it in the
way she raised that boy.

324
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:58,956
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

325
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,042
Lord Royce!
This is hardly the time.

326
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,794
Apologies, my lady.

327
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,662
And to you
as well, Baelish.

328
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,548
We treated you
a bit harshly.

329
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,383
You want justice,
Lord Royce.

330
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,935
I can hardly
complain about that.

331
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,770
I want the same.

332
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:17,441
Not much justice to be meted
out in suicide, is there?

333
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,777
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

334
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,946
Only 20 years ago,
the knights of the Vale

335
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,232
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

336
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,953
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

337
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,821
And since then,
Arryn and Royce,

338
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:32,489
Corbray, Waynwood,

339
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,709
all the great houses of the
Vale watched from the corner.

340
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,544
A timid boy
at a tavern brawl.

341
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:40,080
Are you questioning
our courage?

342
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,033
I want to know
which side you're on.

343
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:44,551
Do you support
the Lannisters,

344
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,670
the house that executed
your friend Ned Stark?

345
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,006
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

346
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,977
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support and Lysa refused.

347
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,980
By staying out of the fray,
you've allowed Tywin Lannister

348
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,548
to destroy his rivals
on every compass point.

349
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,017
Who stands
against him now?

350
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,719
Who would you have
us back, Lord Baelish?

351
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,488
Robb Stark is dead.

352
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,107
I'd have you back
Robin Arryn,

353
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,826
Lord of the Vale.

354
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,828
Robin Arryn is
a sickly little boy.

355
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,281
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

356
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,367
More often
they die young.

357
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:18,952
I adored Lysa
with all my heart.

358
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,923
But she loved her son so much,
she became overprotective.

359
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,709
He needs to learn
how to swing a sword.

360
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,094
How to ride a horse.

361
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,963
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes, it's time.

362
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,882
Time for him
to tour the Vale,

363
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,385
to visit all the castles
in his domain.

364
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:37,805
Time for Robin
to leave the nest.

365
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,543
<i>Ser Barristan.</i>

366
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,412
Yes?

367
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,465
Who sent you?

368
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,369
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

369
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,205
Have I forgotten
a council meeting?

370
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,508
No.

371
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,051
What's this?

372
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,603
A royal pardon

373
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,222
signed by
Robert Baratheon.

374
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,038
You spied on her.

375
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,575
Who gave you this?

376
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,994
Does it matter?

377
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,221
Have you told her?

378
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,557
I wanted to tell you
first, man-to-man

379
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:39,560
rather than go
behind your back.

380
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,848
Let me speak
with her in private.

381
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,184
You'll never be alone
with her again.

382
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:26,473
Why did the usurper
pardon you?

383
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,144
If we could
speak alone.

384
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,597
No, speak to me here.

385
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:36,116
Explain it to me.

386
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,268
Who do you think
sent this to Meereen?

387
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,103
Who profits?

388
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:42,272
This is the work
of Tywin Lannister.

389
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,107
He wants to divide us.

390
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,793
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

391
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,796
The pardon was signed
the year we met.

392
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,217
Why were you pardoned?

393
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,586
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

394
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,007
It is not forged.

395
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,059
Why, then?

396
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,810
I sent letters to Varys,

397
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:06,063
the spymaster
of King's Landing.

398
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,515
What was the content
of these letters?

399
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,968
- Information.
- What information?

400
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,937
When you and Viserys
arrived in Pentos.

401
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,440
His plan to marry you
to Khal Drogo.

402
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,742
<i>When you were married.</i>

403
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,494
When your brother died.

404
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:22,996
You told him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

405
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,648
- I--
- Yes or no?

406
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,982
- Khaleesi.
- <i>Don't call me that.</i>

407
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,286
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

408
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,457
Yes.

409
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,295
That wine merchant
tried to poison me

410
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,880
because of
your information.

411
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,715
I stopped you
from drinking his wine.

412
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,684
Because you knew
it was poisoned.

413
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,053
I suspected.

414
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,472
You betrayed me

415
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:50,691
from the first.

416
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:53,560
Forgive me.

417
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,812
I never meant--

418
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,148
please, Khaleesi,
forgive me.

419
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,867
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

420
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,869
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you.

421
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:04,288
Fought for you.
Killed for you.

422
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,872
...and you want me
to forgive you?

423
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,859
I have loved you.

424
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:11,828
Love?

425
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:14,665
Love? How can you
say that to me?

426
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,701
<i>Any other man, and I
would have you executed.</i>

427
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,971
But you, I do not want you
in my city dead or alive.

428
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,391
Go back to your masters
in King's Landing.

429
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,977
Collect your pardon
if you can.

430
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,715
Daenerys, please.

431
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:35,268
Don't ever presume
to touch me again

432
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,720
or speak my name.

433
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:38,488
You have until dusk
to collect your things

434
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,889
and leave this city.

435
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:42,859
<i>If you're found in Meereen</i>
<i>past break of day,</i>

436
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:45,529
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

437
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,700
Go.

438
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,103
Now.

439
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,144
Moat Cailin
is yours, Father.

440
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,270
Walk with me.

441
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,855
Has there been
any word from Locke?

442
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,990
No.

443
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,308
Unimportant.

444
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:07,327
A cripple,
a young boy.

445
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:10,414
None of the northern
lords have seen them.

446
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,417
Dead most likely.

447
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,154
Most of the ironborn
have fled the North.

448
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:22,125
Now more will follow,
thanks to you.

449
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,797
Tell me what you see.

450
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,837
Moors, fields, hills.

451
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:36,807
Tell me what you see.

452
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,230
Nothing.

453
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,815
Not nothing.

454
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,234
The North.

455
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,036
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

456
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:52,906
400 miles that way.

457
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,991
300 miles that way.

458
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:58,912
The North is larger than the
other six kingdoms combined.

459
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,797
And I am the Warden
of the North.

460
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,333
The North is mine.

461
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,587
Now tell me,
what is your name?

462
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,543
Ramsay Snow.

463
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,679
No, not Ramsay Snow.

464
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,682
Open it.

465
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,852
From this day
until your last day,

466
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,570
you are Ramsay Bolton,

467
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:26,523
son of Roose Bolton,
Warden of the North.

468
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,915
You honor me.

469
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:37,951
I swear I will
uphold your name

470
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,953
and your tradition.

471
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,372
I will be worthy
of you, Father,

472
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,791
I promise.

473
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:06,897
Come, Reek,
I'll be needing a bath.

474
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,510
Yes?

475
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,343
<i>First time I saw you,</i>
<i>you were just a child.</i>

476
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,646
<i>A girl from the North come to
the capital for the first time.</i>

477
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,382
Not a child any longer.

478
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,888
Why did you help me?

479
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,290
They would have thrown you
through the Moon Door

480
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,992
if they found
you guilty.

481
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,544
<i>That's not an answer.</i>

482
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,299
If they'd have
executed you,

483
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,801
what would they
have done with me?

484
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,170
I don't know.

485
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,640
Neither do I.

486
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,843
Better to gamble
on the man you know

487
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:28,612
than the strangers
you don't?

488
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,649
And you think
you know me?

489
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,036
I know what you want.

490
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,954
<i>Do you?</i>

491
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,088
I thought
it'd make me happy,

492
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,090
but it doesn't.
Not really.

493
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,175
Nothing makes
you happy.

494
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:00,844
- Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

495
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,896
Killing Polliver,
killing Rorge.

496
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,149
So you're sad because you didn't
get to kill Joffrey yourself.

497
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,434
Is that it?

498
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,052
At least I could
have been there to watch.

499
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,072
I wanted to see the look in his
eyes when he knew it was over.

500
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:15,492
Aye, nothing in the world
beats that look.

501
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,061
You protected him
for most of his life.

502
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,446
You think you
could have saved him?

503
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,515
I wasn't the damn
wine taster.

504
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:28,838
Little shit deserved
to die, but poison--

505
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,708
poison's a woman's weapon.

506
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,593
Men kill with steel.

507
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:35,095
That's your stupid
pride talking.

508
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:37,464
It's why you'll never
be a great killer.

509
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,300
I'd have killed Joffrey with
a chicken bone if I had to.

510
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:44,854
I'd pay good money
to see that.

511
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,610
You should have
let me burn it.

512
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,146
It's a fleabite.

513
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,616
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

514
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,953
Well, we won't have to
walk too much further.

515
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,905
You really think my
aunt will pay for me?

516
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,540
Aye, she'll pay.

517
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,941
I've never even
met her.

518
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:08,378
Doesn't matter.
You're her blood.

519
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,999
Family, honor,
all that horseshit.

520
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,618
It's all you lords
and ladies ever talk about.

521
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,804
I'm not a lady.

522
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,091
Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

523
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,460
The bloody Hound,
Sandor Clegane.

524
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:26,763
And his...

525
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,799
traveling companion
Arya Stark,

526
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:32,802
<i>niece of your lady</i>
<i>Lysa Arryn.</i>

527
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,688
Then I offer
my condolences.

528
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,024
Lady Arryn died.

529
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:43,279
Three days ago.

530
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,466
I've never left home
before, Uncle Petyr.

531
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,635
- I'm afraid to leave.
- You shouldn't be.

532
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,721
The Lord of the Vale belongs
in the Eyrie, Mother said.

533
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,274
She said it's not
safe outside.

534
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,026
It wasn't safe
for her inside.

535
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,846
People die
at their dinner tables.

536
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:18,982
They die in their beds.

537
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,402
They die squatting
over their chamber pots.

538
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,821
Everybody dies
sooner or later.

539
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:26,706
Don't worry
about your death.

540
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,459
Worry about your life.

541
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,878
Take charge of your life

542
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,363
for as long as it lasts.

543
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:37,333
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

544
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,359
Shall we go?

545
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,036
Wine always helps.

546
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,173
I thank you
for it.

547
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,543
Trial by combat.

548
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:25,014
Deciding a man's guilt
or innocence

549
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,217
in the eyes of the gods

550
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,886
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

551
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,689
Tells you something
about the gods.

552
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,759
How much longer?

553
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:39,095
Soon.

554
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:44,267
Do you think
Oberyn has a chance?

555
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,272
The Red Viper of Dorne.

556
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,491
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

557
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,909
<i>I've never</i>
<i>seen him fight.</i>

558
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,712
Oh, he's going to die.
I'm going to die.

559
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,046
Oberyn believes in himself.

560
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,132
That's putting it mildly.

561
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,335
What's the punishment
for regicide?

562
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,171
Drawing and quartering?
Hanging?

563
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,557
- <i>Breaking at the wheel?</i>
- Beheading.

564
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,325
<i>Seems rather</i>
<i>ordinary.</i>

565
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,861
<i>And he was my nephew</i>
<i>as well, so what is that?</i>

566
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,429
Fratricide is brothers.

567
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,598
Filicide is sons.

568
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,185
Nepoticide.
That's the one.

569
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:24,324
Matricide, patricide,

570
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:27,243
infanticide, suicide.

571
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,197
There's no kind of killing that
doesn't have its own word.

572
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,116
Cousins.

573
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,218
<i>Cousins, you're right.</i>

574
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,986
There is no word
for cousin killing.

575
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:38,821
Well done.

576
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:41,874
Do you remember cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

577
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,210
Of course. Wet-nurse
dropped him on his head.

578
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,846
- Left him simple.
- <i>Simple?</i>

579
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,932
Used to sit all day
in the garden.

580
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,717
Crushing beetles
with a rock.

581
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,639
Nothing made him happier.

582
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,024
Nothing made you happier.

583
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:59,943
You'd think being
tormented from birth

584
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,145
would have given you some
affinity for the afflicted.

585
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,365
On the contrary. Laughing
at another person's misery

586
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,367
was the only thing that made
me feel like everyone else.

587
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,285
The joke wore thin, though.

588
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,204
<i>For you.</i>
<i>You drifted away.</i>

589
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,905
I had other interests.

590
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,958
Yes, other interests.

591
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,861
But I stayed with Orson.

592
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,830
<i>Why?</i>

593
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,298
I was curious.

594
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,700
Why was he smashing
all those beetles?

595
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:26,269
What did he
get out of it?

596
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,388
<i>First thing I did</i>
<i>was ask him.</i>

597
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:32,175
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

598
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,228
He gave me an answer.
"Smash the beetles.

599
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:38,181
Smash 'em."

600
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,984
<i>I wasn't deterred.</i>

601
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,718
I was the smartest
person I knew.

602
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,271
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

603
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,990
that lay at the heart
of a moron.

604
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,576
So I went to
Maester Volarik's library.

605
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,779
Volarik.
Tried to touch me once.

606
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,331
Turns out, far too much has
been written about great men

607
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,533
and not nearly enough
about morons.

608
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,869
Doesn't seem right.

609
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,838
In any case,
I found nothing

610
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,873
that illuminated the nature
of Orson's affliction

611
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,709
or the reason behind his
relentless beetle slaughter.

612
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:09,078
<i>So I went back</i>
<i>to the source.</i>

613
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,280
<i>I may not have been able</i>
<i>to speak with Orson,</i>

614
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,933
but I could observe him,
watch him

615
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,219
the way men
watch animals

616
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,105
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behavior.

617
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:23,309
And as I watched,

618
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,862
I became more and more
sure of it.

619
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,531
There was something
happening there.

620
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,784
His face was like
the page of a book

621
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:33,769
written in a language
I didn't understand.

622
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:36,622
But he wasn't mindless.
He had his reasons.

623
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,942
<i>And I became possessed</i>
<i>with knowing what they were.</i>

624
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,496
I began to spend inordinate
amounts of time watching him.

625
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:46,165
I would eat my lunch
in the garden,

626
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,301
chewing my mutton
to the music of...

627
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,922
And when I wasn't watching
him, I was thinking about him.

628
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,725
Father droned on about
the family legacy

629
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,493
<i>and I thought about</i>
<i>Orson's beetles.</i>

630
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,396
I read the histories
of Targaryen conquests.

631
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,598
Did I hear dragon wings?
No.

632
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,601
I heard...

633
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:09,405
<i>And I still couldn't figure</i>
<i>out why he was doing it.</i>

634
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,741
And I had to know,
because it was horrible

635
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,144
that all these beetles should
be dying for no reason.

636
00:45:15,162 --> 00:45:16,696
Every day around the world,

637
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,149
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

638
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,985
Who gives a dusty fuck
about a bunch of beetles?

639
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,821
I know, I know. But still,
it filled me with dread.

640
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,375
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

641
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,260
How many countless living
crawling things

642
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,263
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

643
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,682
In my dreams I found myself

644
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:39,185
standing on a beach
made of beetle husks

645
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:41,270
stretching as far
as the eye could see.

646
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,473
I woke up crying,

647
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,858
weeping for their
shattered little bodies.

648
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:48,227
I tried to stop
Orson once.

649
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,645
He was twice your size.

650
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:51,447
He just pushed me
aside with a "kuuh"

651
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,033
and kept on smashing.

652
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,569
Every day until
that mule

653
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,621
kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

654
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:11,867
So what do you think?

655
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:14,337
Why did he do it?

656
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,672
What was it all about?

657
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,478
I don't know.

658
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,915
Good luck today.

659
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:17,433
Looks like
very light armor.

660
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:18,818
I like to move around.

661
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,736
You could at least
wear a helmet.

662
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,574
You shouldn't drink
before a fight.

663
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,792
You learn this during your
years in the fighting pits?

664
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:29,128
I always drink
before a fight.

665
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:31,614
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

666
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:34,584
Today is not
the day I die.

667
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,643
You're going
to fight that?

668
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:46,229
I'm going
to kill that.

669
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,268
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

670
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,021
Size does not matter when
you are flat on your back.

671
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,355
Thank the gods.

672
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,044
In the sight of gods
and men,

673
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,280
we gather to ascertain

674
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,083
the guilt or innocence
of this...

675
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:11,254
<i>man Tyrion Lannister.</i>

676
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,456
<i>May the Mother grant</i>
<i>them mercy.</i>

677
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,660
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

678
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:20,379
And may the Warrior
guide the hand...

679
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,549
- - ...of our champion--

680
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,693
Don't leave me
alone in this world.

681
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,645
Never.

682
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:57,750
Have they told you
who I am?

683
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,468
Some dead man.

684
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:07,176
I am the brother
of Elia Martell.

685
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,262
Do you know why I have come
all the way to this stinking

686
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,548
shit-pile of a city?

687
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:14,400
For you.

688
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,890
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

689
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:23,909
You raped my sister.

690
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:25,361
You murdered her.

691
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,163
You killed her children.

692
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,915
Say it now and we can
make this quick.

693
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:41,043
Say it.
You raped her.

694
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:44,880
You murdered her.

695
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,934
You killed her children.

696
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,781
You raped her!

697
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:03,032
You murdered her!

698
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,084
You killed her children!

699
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,908
You raped her!

700
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,610
You murdered her!

701
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,988
You killed
her children!

702
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,181
Wait.
Are you dying?

703
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:10,966
No, no, no.

704
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,053
You can't die yet.
You haven't confessed.

705
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,808
Say it.

706
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,528
Say her name.
Elia Martell.

707
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,814
You raped her.
You killed her children.

708
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:27,366
Elia Martell.

709
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,118
Who gave you the order?

710
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:31,704
Who gave you
the order?!

711
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:34,039
Say her name!

712
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:36,158
You raped her!
You murdered her!

713
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,377
<i>You killed her children.</i>

714
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:40,996
Say it.
Say her name.

715
00:51:42,582 --> 00:51:44,583
Say it!

716
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:52,925
Elia Martell.

717
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:57,045
I killed her
children.

718
00:51:57,063 --> 00:51:59,515
Then I raped her.

719
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,685
Then I smashed her head
in like this!

720
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:18,501
The gods have made
their will known.

721
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,670
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

722
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,373
<i>in the name of King Tommen</i>
<i>of the House Baratheon,</i>

723
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,592
<i>First of His Name,</i>

724
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:28,677
you are hereby
sentenced to death.
