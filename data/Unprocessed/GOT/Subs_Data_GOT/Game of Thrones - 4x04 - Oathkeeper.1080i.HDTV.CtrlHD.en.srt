1
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,836
My name

2
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,505
is Grey Worm.

3
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,175
I come from

4
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,262
the Summer "Ills."

5
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,047
Isles.

6
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,183
Summer Isles.

7
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:58,437
<i>Summer Isles.</i>

8
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,730
I am from an island
called Naath.

9
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,318
When they took you?

10
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:16,538
<i>"When</i> did<i> they take me?"</i>

11
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,827
I was five years old.

12
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,996
You remember your home?

13
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,300
I remember when they
rowed us away from shore.

14
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:33,839
How white
the beaches were.

15
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,509
How tall the trees.

16
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,682
And I remember
my village burning.

17
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:47,235
Smoke rising
into the sky.

18
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,862
Do you remember your home?

19
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,115
Unsullied.

20
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,701
Always Unsullied.

21
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,038
Before Unsullied,
nothing.

22
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,340
That's not true.

23
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,045
Perhaps one day you will
return to the Summer Isles.

24
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,880
I don't want return.

25
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,753
Kill the masters.

26
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,356
Kill the masters.

27
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,893
<i>How are the lessons coming?</i>

28
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,862
Very well,
Your Grace.

29
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,282
Missandei is teacher
good, my queen.

30
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,121
You'll have
to continue later.

31
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,075
It's time.

32
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:35,440
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

33
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,344
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!

34
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,848
Mhysa! Mhysa!

35
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,571
<i>Remind me, Ser Jorah,</i>

36
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:27,108
<i>how many children did the Great
Masters nail to mileposts?</i>

37
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,445
163, Khaleesi.

38
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,497
Yes, that was it.

39
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:43,792
<i>Your Grace,</i>
<i>may I have a word?</i>

40
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,682
The city is yours.

41
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,518
<i>All these people,</i>
<i>they're your subjects now.</i>

42
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,255
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice

43
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,090
with mercy.

44
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:03,228
I will answer injustice
with justice.

45
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,725
What the hell was that?

46
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,228
That was me knocking
your ass to the dirt

47
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,980
with your own hand.

48
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,067
You're a rare talent.

49
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,321
When you're fighting
cripples, anyway.

50
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,874
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

51
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:42,961
I'll bet that thrust through the Mad
King's back was pretty as a picture.

52
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,363
<i>You want to fight pretty</i>
<i>or you want to win?</i>

53
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,165
You talk to my brother
this way?

54
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:48,750
All the time.

55
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,136
He got used to it.

56
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,045
Do you think
he did it?

57
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,148
No.

58
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,683
Oh, he hated
the little twat, sure.

59
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:07,685
But who didn't?

60
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,738
And poison's
not his style.

61
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:14,192
Or murder,
for that matter.

62
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,912
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

63
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,419
You haven't been
to see him yet, eh?

64
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,372
We're done for today.

65
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,577
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

66
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:35,763
You stood for him in his trial
by combat at the Eyrie.

67
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,932
Aye.

68
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,968
But only when
Lady Arryn demanded

69
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,637
the trial take place
that day.

70
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,806
You were his first choice.

71
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,258
He named you
for his champion

72
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:50,895
because he knew you would ride day
and night to come fight for him.

73
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,365
You gonna fight
for him now?

74
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,076
To tell you the truth,
this isn't so bad.

75
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,162
Four walls.
A pot to piss in.

76
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,965
I was chained
to a wooden post

77
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,585
covered in my own
shit for months.

78
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,173
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

79
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,925
Maybe a bit.

80
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm sorry I didn't
come sooner.

81
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,566
It's complicated, yes.

82
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,570
- So how is our sister?
- How do you think?

83
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,189
Her son died in her arms.

84
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,808
Her son?

85
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,194
Don't.

86
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,985
You know what's coming?

87
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,821
My trial for regicide.
Yes, I know.

88
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,893
I know the whole bloody
country thinks I'm guilty.

89
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,095
I know that one
of my three judges

90
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,347
has wished me dead more
times than I can count.

91
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,883
And that judge
is my father.

92
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,502
As for Cersei,

93
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,504
well, she's probably
working on a way

94
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:09,357
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

95
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:12,827
Now that you mention it,
she did ask.

96
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,730
So, should I turn around
and close my eyes?

97
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,916
Depends.

98
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,134
Did you do it?

99
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,920
The Kingslayer brothers.

100
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,323
You like it?
I like it.

101
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,827
You're really asking
if I killed your son?

102
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:33,381
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

103
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,820
How can I help you?

104
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:41,389
Well, you could
set me free.

105
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,559
You know I can't.

106
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:47,645
Then there's really
nothing else to say.

107
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,014
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?

108
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,516
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

109
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,518
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

110
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,320
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

111
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,438
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

112
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,940
Inappropriate?

113
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,943
You're accused of killing the king.
Freeing you is treason.

114
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,894
Except I didn't do it.

115
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,913
Which is why
we're having a trial.

116
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:08,249
A trial.

117
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:11,035
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

118
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:15,373
confessed to his crimes, and gave
irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

119
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,841
<i>it wouldn't matter</i>
<i>to Cersei.</i>

120
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,877
She won't rest
until my head's on a spike.

121
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,046
Not just yours.

122
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,433
She's offering a knighthood
to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

123
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,084
Sansa couldn't
have done this.

124
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,887
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

125
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,423
Do you think it's a coincidence she
disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

126
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,726
No, but...

127
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,945
Sansa's not a killer.

128
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,616
Not yet, anyway.

129
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,131
Where are you taking me?

130
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,333
I'm getting married
to your Aunt Lysa.

131
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,619
She's waiting for us
at the Eyrie.

132
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,422
You'll be safe there.

133
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,236
Did you kill Joffrey?

134
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,439
Did I kill Joffrey?

135
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,742
I've been in
the Vale for weeks.

136
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,943
I know it was you.

137
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:29,914
And who helped me
with this conspiracy?

138
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,818
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

139
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,037
You used him to get
me out of King's Landing,

140
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,673
but you would never trust
him to kill the king.

141
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,343
- Why not? - Because you're
too smart to trust a drunk.

142
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,929
Then perhaps it was
your husband.

143
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,497
No.

144
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,266
<i>How do you know?</i>

145
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,935
I just do.

146
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,104
You're right.

147
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,606
He wasn't involved
in Joffrey's death.

148
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,642
But you were.

149
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,396
<i>Do you remember that lovely</i>
<i>necklace Dontos gave you?</i>

150
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,617
<i>I don't suppose you noticed</i>
<i>that a stone was missing</i>

151
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,903
<i>after the feast.</i>

152
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,489
The poison.

153
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,526
I don't understand.

154
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,129
The Lannisters gave you
wealth, power.

155
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,964
Joffrey made you
the Lord of Harrenhal.

156
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,867
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

157
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,553
<i>Always keep</i>
<i>your foes confused.</i>

158
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:28,506
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

159
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,642
they can't know
what you plan to do next.

160
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,564
I don't believe you.

161
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,735
<i>If they catch you, they'll
put your head on a spike</i>

162
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,153
<i>just like my father's.</i>

163
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,356
You'd risk that
just to confuse them?

164
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,528
So many men,
they risk so little.

165
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,564
They spend their lives
avoiding danger.

166
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:56,000
And then they die.

167
00:18:57,286 --> 00:19:01,088
I'd risk everything
to get what I want.

168
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:04,258
And what do you want?

169
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,799
Everything.

170
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,971
My friendship with the
Lannisters was productive.

171
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,724
But Joffrey,

172
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,276
a vicious boy with
a crown on his head,

173
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,595
is not a reliable ally.

174
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:26,564
And who could trust
a friend like that?

175
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,866
Who could trust you?

176
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,436
I don't want
friends like me.

177
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,939
My new friends
are predictable.

178
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:36,457
Very reasonable people.

179
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,210
<i>As for what</i>
<i>happened to Joffrey,</i>

180
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,548
well, that was something my new
friends wanted very badly.

181
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,050
<i>Nothing like</i>
<i>a thoughtful gift</i>

182
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,669
<i>to make a new friendship</i>
<i>grow strong.</i>

183
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,621
I can't believe
you're going.

184
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:53,257
Leaving me alone here
with these people.

185
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,626
<i>The time has come,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

186
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:58,679
There's nothing
more tedious than a trial.

187
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,182
Except perhaps
these gardens.

188
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,968
If I have to take one
more leisurely stroll

189
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:07,188
through these gardens, I'll
fling myself from the cliffs.

190
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,741
Have you been
to see Tommen yet?

191
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,743
No.

192
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,695
Have they even agreed
to the match?

193
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,480
No one tells me anything.

194
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:20,701
I wasn't originally meant to marry
your grandfather Luthor, you know.

195
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,120
He was engaged
to my sister,

196
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,322
your great-aunt Viola.

197
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,593
I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.

198
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,346
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

199
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,932
But the moment
I saw my intended,

200
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,302
with his twitchy
little ferret's face

201
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,304
and ludicrous silver hair,

202
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:42,356
I knew he wouldn't do.

203
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,942
So the evening

204
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,029
before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,

205
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,731
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

206
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,067
and happened
upon his chamber.

207
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:56,687
- How absentminded of me.
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:20:56,705 --> 00:21:00,875
The following morning, Luthor
never made it down the stairs

209
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,662
to propose to my sister 'cause
the boy couldn't bloody walk.

210
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,998
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

211
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,417
was what I'd given him
the night before.

212
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,636
I was good.

213
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,338
I was very, very good.

214
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,809
You are even better.

215
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,428
But you need
to act quickly.

216
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,315
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

217
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,234
She'll turn the boy against
you as soon as she can.

218
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,571
And by the time you're
married, it'll be too late.

219
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:32,573
Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent

220
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,442
is rather distracted
at the moment.

221
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,911
Mourning her dear
departed boy.

222
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,330
Accusing her brother
of his murder,

223
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,332
which he didn't commit.

224
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,500
Well, he could have done.

225
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,452
He could have done,
but he didn't.

226
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,505
- You don't know, Grandmother.
- But I do know.

227
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,126
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

228
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,246
What?
I don't understand.

229
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:59,884
Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.

230
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,555
You just do
what needs to be done.

231
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,025
<i>Bring it through!</i>

232
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,651
And again.

233
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,911
Very nice. Good.

234
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,613
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

235
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,633
First thing you want to do

236
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,419
is disarm them to try
and even the odds.

237
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:50,901
Let's see what you can do.

238
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,605
Olly, you just watch
for now.

239
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,689
I can fight.

240
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,808
Have you ever
held a sword before?

241
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,860
I was the best archer
in our hamlet.

242
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,279
I was!

243
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,615
I believe you.

244
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,333
We'll go hunting
for rabbits one day.

245
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,085
Right now,
watch and learn.

246
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:12,339
You two.

247
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:15,459
Take it slow,
try and disarm each other.

248
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,037
You know how to fight.

249
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,539
You could have gone
easier on him.

250
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,992
He wouldn't have learned
anything that way.

251
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,995
<i>Lord Snow.</i>

252
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,530
What do you think
you're doing?

253
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:56,167
Grenn and I were
helping them.

254
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,335
Grenn's a ranger.
You're a steward.

255
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,472
Maybe you forgot that while you
were off with your wildling bitch,

256
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,474
but I didn't.

257
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,843
Someone has
to train them.

258
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,728
And that someone
isn't you.

259
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:10,097
Go find a chamber pot
to empty.

260
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,402
Go on. Do it.

261
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:17,438
You traitor's bastard.

262
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,406
Give me an excuse.

263
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:22,359
Mormont's not here
to protect you now.

264
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,756
Get back to work.

265
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,209
Now!

266
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,761
I said now!

267
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,017
The bastard's well-liked.
You're not.

268
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,603
You think I care if they like me?
We're at war.

269
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:51,188
For now.

270
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,423
But you can't be
acting commander forever.

271
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,559
There will be a choosing.

272
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,561
The old maester
will insist on it.

273
00:24:57,595 --> 00:25:00,064
You might reconsider

274
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,816
his request to march
on Craster's.

275
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,453
Let the mutineers
take care of Snow.

276
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,906
Or you might be taking
orders from him

277
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,491
the rest of your life.

278
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,508
A bastard, eh?

279
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,261
Took you for highborn.

280
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,647
My father was highborn.

281
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:36,350
My mother wasn't.

282
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,437
Name's Locke.

283
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,275
Jon Snow.

284
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,163
You fight well.

285
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:50,915
What brought you up here?

286
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,033
A sense of duty.

287
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,337
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

288
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,625
I was a game warden
in the Stormlands.

289
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,261
Fed a prized partridge
to my hungry kids.

290
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,096
I was stupid enough
to get caught.

291
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,265
Chose the Wall
over losing my hand.

292
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,969
Figured I wouldn't have to suck
up to any highborn cunts here.

293
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,271
<i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

294
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,023
What are you
waiting for? Summer?

295
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,524
Guess I was wrong.

296
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,830
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

297
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,799
Your Grace.

298
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,634
How formal of you.

299
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:48,756
How many Kingsguards are
posted outside Tommen's door?

300
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,209
Ser Boros
is on duty tonight.

301
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:54,595
- Tomorrow I believe--
- <i>So one?</i>

302
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,766
You have one man
guarding the future king?

303
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,851
I promise you
Tommen's safe.

304
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,152
We're protecting him.

305
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,322
The way you
protected Joffrey?

306
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,193
Why did Catelyn Stark
set you free?

307
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,895
- What? - I've been
wondering for months.

308
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:15,699
Ever since that great cow brought
you back to the capital.

309
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,369
Why did she
set you free?

310
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,372
You know why. She'd hoped I'd
send her daughters back to her.

311
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,379
She hoped
or did you promise?

312
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,214
I swore by all the gods

313
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:32,716
that if her daughters were
alive, I'd return them to her.

314
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,685
So you made a sacred vow
to the enemy.

315
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,388
I wanted to get
back to you.

316
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,224
Should I have told her
to fuck off?

317
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,142
You didn't mean it, then?

318
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,195
You have no loyalty
to Catelyn Stark?

319
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,064
Catelyn Stark's dead.

320
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:49,400
So if I told you to leave the
capital right now and find Sansa,

321
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,570
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

322
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:55,622
and bring me her head,

323
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,891
would you do it?

324
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,682
I know you went
to see Tyrion.

325
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,854
That creature
who murdered our son.

326
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,325
I had to see him.

327
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,844
I had to know
for myself.

328
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,896
And?

329
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:23,100
He didn't do it, Cersei.

330
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,602
You've always pitied him.

331
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:28,939
Our poor little brother.

332
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,774
Abused by the world.

333
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:32,776
Despised by his father
and sister.

334
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,662
He'd kill us all
if he could.

335
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,835
I want four men at Tommen's
door day and night.

336
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:46,090
That will be all,
Lord Commander.

337
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,743
Ser Pounce?

338
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,892
How did you get past
the Kingsguard?

339
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,562
Kingsguard.

340
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:46,150
I don't think you're
supposed to be here.

341
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,186
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

342
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,738
I'm not a visitor,
Your Grace.

343
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:55,008
Word has it
I'm to be your bride.

344
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,499
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

345
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,536
often never meet
until their wedding day?

346
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,925
Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

347
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,178
we ought to get
to know one another.

348
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,380
Don't you think?

349
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,749
Yes.

350
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,802
But if my mother
found out--

351
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,488
It can be our secret.
Hmm?

352
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,892
If we're going to be
man and wife,

353
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:32,830
we'll have a few secrets
from her, I hope.

354
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,817
So, Your Grace...

355
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,203
Yes?

356
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,039
Tell me a secret.

357
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:51,782
Hello. Aren't you
a proper fellow?

358
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,167
That's Ser Pounce.

359
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,570
Very handsome.

360
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,090
Joffrey didn't like him.

361
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,593
He threatened
to skin him alive

362
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,428
and mix his innards
up in my food

363
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,263
so I wouldn't know
I was eating him.

364
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:09,016
That's very cruel.

365
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,002
You don't strike me
as cruel.

366
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,172
No.

367
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,074
I don't think I am.

368
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,142
That's a relief.

369
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,511
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

370
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,780
We say our vows in front
of the high septon.

371
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:25,616
And after the ceremony,
there's a feast.

372
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,085
When we marry,
I become yours.

373
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,670
Forever.

374
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,174
It's getting late.

375
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:37,628
I should go.

376
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,264
May I come and visit
you again?

377
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:45,235
All right, then.

378
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,775
Remember,

379
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,445
our little secret.

380
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,017
<i>"Ser Jaime Lannister.</i>

381
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:37,821
<i>Knighted and named to the
Kingsguard in his 16th year.</i>

382
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,357
At the sack
of King's Landing,

383
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,776
murdered his king
Aerys II.

384
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,029
Pardoned by
Robert Baratheon.

385
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,282
Thereafter known
as the Kingslayer."

386
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,619
It's the duty of the Lord
Commander to fill those pages.

387
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,592
And there's still room
left on mine.

388
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,241
Valyrian steel.

389
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,777
Mmm.

390
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:35,111
It's yours.

391
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:36,780
I can't accept this.

392
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,115
It was reforged
from Ned Stark's sword.

393
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:42,252
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

394
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:47,808
You swore an oath to return the
Stark girls to their mother.

395
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:50,227
Lady Stark's dead.

396
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,179
Arya's probably
dead, too,

397
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,399
but there's still a chance to find
Sansa and get her somewhere safe.

398
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:58,351
I've got something
else for you.

399
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,506
<i>I hope I got</i>
<i>your measurements right.</i>

400
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,794
I'll find her.

401
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,632
For Lady Catelyn.

402
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,303
And for you.

403
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,362
I almost forgot.

404
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,482
I have one more gift.

405
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,204
I don't need a squire.

406
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,156
Of course you do.

407
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,791
He'll slow me down.

408
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,160
My brother owes him a debt.
He's not safe here.

409
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,713
You're keeping him from harm.
It's chivalry.

410
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,799
I won't
slow you down, ser--

411
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,253
my lady.

412
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,755
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I'll serve you well.</i>

413
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,092
See? He's a good lad.
You'll get along.

414
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:18,598
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

415
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,651
His axe from the Blackwater.

416
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,825
What are you
waiting for, a kiss?

417
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,746
Ready the lady's horse.

418
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,508
They say the best swords
have names.

419
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,959
Any ideas?

420
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,800
Oathkeeper.

421
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,197
Good-bye, Brienne.

422
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,089
Come on, move.

423
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,833
I should never
have taken her away.

424
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:03,003
- She wasn't safe here.
- She's not safe out there.

425
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,871
I should have known.

426
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,090
You told us there were
wildlings south of the Wall.

427
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,876
<i>If they're raiding the smaller
villages, Mole's Town could be next.</i>

428
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,296
- Castle Black could be next.
- I should go back for Gilly.

429
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,931
We have orders. No one's
to leave the castle.

430
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,467
I remember when you disobeyed
orders and rode south to help Robb.

431
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,686
And I remember who came after
me and brought me home.

432
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,175
I know how hard
it is, Sam, believe me.

433
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,030
When you told me about Bran
going beyond the Wall,

434
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:33,450
all I could think about was getting my
strength back so I could go and find him.

435
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,320
I wish I could have convinced
him to come back with me.

436
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,625
I tried.
Really, I did.

437
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:46,195
How fast could they travel?

438
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:49,699
A crippled boy being pulled
on a sledge by a simpleton?

439
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,251
I don't know.

440
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,536
They'd pass
wildling villages.

441
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,589
They could try to find
shelter at one of them.

442
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,877
The wildlings
have joined up with Mance.

443
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:04,180
Every village or sheltered
place will be deserted.

444
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,653
Except...

445
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,225
<i>Craster's?</i>

446
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,694
You think Bran
might have found--

447
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,163
Snow.

448
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,831
I don't mean
to interrupt.

449
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,534
Thorne wants to see you.

450
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:30,674
Your foray
to Craster's Keep,

451
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,759
I'll sanction it.

452
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:36,680
But I won't order
anyone to go with you.

453
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,382
Volunteers only.

454
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,551
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

455
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,064
Ahem, brothers.

456
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,078
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep.

457
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:12,465
I'm going to capture the mutineers
holed up there or kill them.

458
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,585
<i>I'm asking for volunteers</i>
<i>to come with me.</i>

459
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:19,923
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's

460
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:22,792
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

461
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,894
but we have to do this.

462
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,181
<i>Our survival</i>
<i>may depend on</i>

463
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,067
<i>us getting to these mutineers
before Mance does.</i>

464
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,771
They know the Wall.
They know our defenses.

465
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,774
If Mance learns what
they know, we're lost.

466
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,579
But if that's not enough,

467
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,081
then consider this.

468
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,450
If the Night's Watch
are truly brothers,

469
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:50,453
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

470
00:39:51,705 --> 00:39:53,790
He lived and died
for the Watch

471
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:56,325
and he was betrayed
by his own men.

472
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,044
Stabbed in the back
by cowards.

473
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,013
He deserved far better.

474
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:03,600
All we can give him now
is justice.

475
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,886
Who will join me?

476
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,189
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

477
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,491
Then let me say my vows.

478
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,744
If it's a fight you're heading for,
then you need men who know how.

479
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,092
Thank you, brothers.

480
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,885
<i>No, don't.</i>

481
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,688
<i>Don't, please.</i>

482
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,806
<i>Please don't. Ow!</i>

483
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,775
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

484
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:45,401
Karl Tanner
from Gin Alley

485
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:48,571
drinking wine
from the skull

486
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:52,075
of Jeor fucking Mormont.

487
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:02,418
Any command for us,
Lord Commander?

488
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:05,004
What's that?

489
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,473
Fuck 'em
till they're dead?

490
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:11,060
- <i> Did you hear that, boys?</i>

491
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,730
Fuck 'em
till they're dead.

492
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,654
Rast.

493
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,412
Go outside
and feed the beast.

494
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,781
We should kill that thing.

495
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,785
You should shut
your fucking hole,

496
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,821
ugly little cunt.

497
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,258
You look like
a fucking ballsack.

498
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,044
Ugly. Look at your
stupid cunt face.

499
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:48,631
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

500
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:54,053
Know how much they paid me to
kill a man in King's Landing?

501
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,689
Seven silvers.

502
00:42:56,724 --> 00:43:00,476
They told me a man's name and that
man never saw daylight again.

503
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,279
None of them cocksuckers
got away from me.

504
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,869
Haven't lost a fight
since I was nine.

505
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,740
Maybe it's time.

506
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,525
What do you think, eh?

507
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:19,629
Maybe you're the man.

508
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,799
Eh, cunt?

509
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,503
I wouldn't stand a chance.

510
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:29,589
None of us would.

511
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,675
I was a fucking legend
in Gin Alley.

512
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:35,812
A fucking legend!

513
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,430
I would take any knight--

514
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,216
any knight, any time.

515
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:43,903
Fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

516
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,915
- A gift for the gods.
- A gift for the gods.

517
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:57,533
A gift for the gods.

518
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,085
What the fuck is that?

519
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,288
Craster's last child.
A boy.

520
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,873
What am I supposed
to do with him?

521
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,742
What did Craster
do with 'em?

522
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,962
Kill 'em before they could grow
up and do the same to him?

523
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,049
All right.

524
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,104
Don't need another
mouth to feed.

525
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:21,357
- Hand him over.
- He didn't kill them.

526
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:24,060
- He offered them.
- To who?

527
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,279
To the gods.

528
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:28,564
The white walkers.

529
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:30,650
- A gift for the gods.
- A gift for the gods.

530
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,536
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

531
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,072
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

532
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,790
Shut up!

533
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,915
So...

534
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,953
if it worked for him...

535
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,308
Let's give the walkers
what they want.

536
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:04,901
Rast is headed that way.

537
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,106
Pink-eyed fuck.

538
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:39,662
You thirsty?

539
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,384
Fuck!

540
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:37,003
Hodor.

541
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,343
Do you hear that?

542
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,568
Is that a baby?

543
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,154
It's coming.

544
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,939
I'm going out there.

545
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,075
No, we need
to stay together.

546
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,943
I'm going.

547
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,987
- Bran. Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

548
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:46,656
- Hodor.
- Bran, what happened?

549
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,375
Summer, he's hurt. They've
caught him in a trap.

550
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:50,793
Who?

551
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,496
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

552
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,333
They have Ghost.

553
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,307
<i>They're Night's Watch.</i>

554
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,425
Look.

555
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,894
<i>Jon might be here.</i>

556
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:12,264
If Jon was here, why would
they put his wolf in a cage?

557
00:49:18,572 --> 00:49:20,856
They might have been Night's
Watch once, not anymore.

558
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,725
We're not safe here.
We need to go.

559
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:24,243
No.

560
00:49:24,277 --> 00:49:26,612
Bran, we need to go now.

561
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,531
I'm not leaving
without Summer.

562
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,039
Can you remember
where the cage was?

563
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:39,625
The east side
of the keep.

564
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,080
If I'm not back
soon, we'll meet--

565
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:46,932
Hodor.

566
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,281
Hodor.

567
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,986
Hodor.
Hodor.

568
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,075
Hodor.

569
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,328
If I was your size, I'd be
king of the fucking world.

570
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:30,009
Help him up.

571
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,450
This is nice.

572
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,287
Fine leather.

573
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:01,757
You're no wildling.

574
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,293
Important. Highborn.

575
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,631
Who are you?

576
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:19,675
You see,
where I come from,

577
00:51:19,693 --> 00:51:22,228
a commoner like me slaps
a little lord like you,

578
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,513
I'd lose my right hand.

579
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:28,567
But we're a long way
from home, aren't we?

580
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:32,037
And the two of you,

581
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:35,658
fancy-looking folks
north of the Wall

582
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,910
creeping through
the woods.

583
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:41,547
Isn't that a bit odd?

584
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,219
I like your curly hair.

585
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:52,224
My mom had curls
like that.

586
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:55,227
Beautiful brown curls.

587
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,815
Why'd you drag a crippled
boy all the way up here?

588
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:08,774
See you haven't played
this game before.

589
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,110
A highborn hostage,

590
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,029
<i>that's valuable.</i>

591
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:16,499
But three of them,

592
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,535
that's a lot
of mouths to feed.

593
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,872
<i>- What the fuck's wrong with him?</i>
- Come here.

594
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,907
No, please.

595
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:26,375
Please.
Please, let me help him.

596
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,294
- Who are you?
- Please.

597
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,680
- Who are you?
- I'm Brandon Stark!

598
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,300
I'm Brandon Stark
of Winterfell.

599
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,271
It's Jon Snow's brother.

600
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,192
It's Meera. It's Meera.
I'm right here.

601
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:47,897
And I thought this was gonna
be another boring day.

602
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,870
<i>I'm right here.</i>

9999
