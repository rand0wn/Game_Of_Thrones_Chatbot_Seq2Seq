00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,597
Out, all of you.

6
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05,436
Bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't!

7
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:08,038
I want you and your men

8
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:11,849
gone.

9
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:15,252
And you will make
this right.

10
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:18,880
Wait outside.

00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,850
- Lord Commander.
- Now!

12
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,579
- Lord Commander.
- Leave us.

13
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:47,730
What did you do?

14
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,731
I followed him.

15
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,201
He took the baby
into the woods, the newborn.

16
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,169
What business is that
of yours?

17
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,771
No, you don't understand.

18
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:58,207
He's killing them,
all the boys.

19
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,250
You know.

20
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,091
The wildlings serve
crueler Gods than you or I.

21
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,230
Those boys
are Craster's offerings.

22
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,765
Offerings?

23
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,535
He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.

24
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,604
Aye, many a time that monster
has been the difference

25
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,173
between life and death
for our Rangers.

26
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,542
Your Uncle among them.

27
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,079
We have other wars
to fight out there.

28
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:37,483
Like it or not,
we need men like Craster.

29
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,057
I...

30
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,792
I saw it.

31
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,731
I saw...

32
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,601
Something take
that child.

33
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,770
Yeah.

34
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,972
Whatever it was,

35
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,342
I daresay
you'll see it again.

36
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:06,780
Now ready my horse.

37
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,116
We leave at dawn.

38
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,591
Don't lose it again.

39
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,586
Gilly.

40
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,258
You're leaving.

41
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:51,662
I-- I wanted
to give you something.

42
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,401
It belonged
to my mother.

43
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:01,572
- I can't take it.
- Please.

44
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:03,407
I want you to.

45
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:08,946
My mother used it
for sewing.

46
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:12,149
She'd let me sit with her
in her chamber while she sewed

47
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:14,952
and I'd read to her.

48
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:20,124
My father put a stop
to it when he found out.

49
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,829
It's the only thing
I have of hers.

50
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,899
She gave it to me
before I left for the Wall.

51
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,001
You--

52
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,003
you shouldn't
give it away.

53
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,873
I'm not giving it away.

54
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,075
I'm giving it to you.

55
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:42,113
Keep it safe for me.

56
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:44,249
Till I come back.

57
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:03,936
Hodor.

58
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,005
Hodor.

59
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,075
Rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

60
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,211
<i>Every night it's the same.</i>

61
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:46,547
I'm walking

62
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,149
and running, but...

63
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:54,022
I'm not--
I'm not me.

64
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:57,091
I'm running
through the Godswood,

65
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,426
sniffing the dirt,

66
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,796
tasting blood in my mouth when
I've made a fresh kill,

67
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,699
howling.

68
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,869
Old Nan used to
tell me stories

69
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,937
about magical people
who could live

70
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:16,675
inside stags,
birds, wolves.

71
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,677
That's exactly
what they are, Bran--

72
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,246
- stories.
- So she was lying?

73
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,549
- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.

74
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,152
But they're gone
from the world

75
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,987
along with much else.

76
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,524
These are dreams, Bran,

77
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,059
nothing more.

78
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:37,795
No, my dreams
are different.

79
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:40,031
<i>Mine are true.</i>

80
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,600
I dreamt of my father dying.

81
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,303
And Rickon had
the same dream.

82
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:48,206
What about all the dreams
you had that didn't come true?

83
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,277
Hmm?

84
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,650
Right.

85
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:01,721
This link is made
of Valyrian steel.

86
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:05,691
Only one Maester in 100
wears it on his chain.

87
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:09,695
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

88
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,899
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

89
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,835
I was no different.

90
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,937
I was young.

91
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:22,541
And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers

92
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:26,679
to lift him out of his
dull life into a special one?

93
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:29,548
But in the end,
for all my efforts,

94
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,818
I got no more out of it
than 1,000 boys before me.

95
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,787
Come on.

96
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:46,697
All right.

97
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,901
Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.

98
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,771
But not anymore.

99
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,642
The Dragons are gone.

100
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:01,011
The Giants are dead.

101
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:05,515
And the Children
of the Forest forgotten.

102
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:58,636
Loras!
Highgarden!

103
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,675
Get him!

104
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,414
Oh!

105
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:14,051
Yield!
I yield.

106
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:25,530
Well fought.
Approach.

107
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,575
Rise.
Remove your helm.

108
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:48,320
You are all your father
promised and more, My Lady.

109
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:50,655
I've seen Ser Loras
bested once or twice,

110
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,756
but never quite
in that fashion.

111
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,828
Now, now, my love. My brother
fought valiantly for you.

112
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,532
That he did, my Queen.

113
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,835
But there can only be
one champion.

114
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:05,937
Brienne of Tarth,

115
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,840
<i>you may ask anything</i>
<i>of me you desire.</i>

116
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,876
If it is within my power,
it is yours.

117
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,413
Your Grace,

118
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:17,582
I ask the honor of a place
in your Kingsguard.

119
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:19,451
What?

120
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:22,654
I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,

121
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,023
and keep you safe
from all harm.

122
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,429
Done.

123
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:33,631
Rise, Brienne
of the Kingsguard.

124
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:45,876
Your Grace, I have the honor to
bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

125
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,978
sent as an envoy by her son Robb,
Lord of Winterfell.

126
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:52,649
Lord of Winterfell
and King in the North.

127
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:56,286
Lady Catelyn.
I'm pleased to see you.

128
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,790
May I present my wife
Margaery of House Tyrell?

129
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,328
You are very welcome
here, Lady Stark.

130
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:05,464
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

131
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,334
You are most kind.

132
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:10,902
My Lady,

133
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:13,571
I swear to you I will see
the Lannisters answer

134
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:15,807
for your husband's murder.

135
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:18,242
When I take King's Landing,

136
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,310
I'll bring you
Joffrey's head.

137
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,188
It will be enough to know that
justice was done, My Lord.

138
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:34,691
<i>Your Grace.</i>

139
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,094
And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

140
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:40,497
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

141
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:42,934
Has your son marched against
Tywin Lannister yet?

142
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:46,972
I do not sit on
my son's war councils.

143
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:50,909
And if I did, I would not share his
strategies with you.

144
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:53,878
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

145
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,947
not hide behind
his mother's skirts.

146
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:58,983
My son is fighting a war,

147
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,918
not playing at one.

148
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,099
Don't worry, My Lady.

149
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,201
Our war is just beginning.

150
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,616
- Your Grace.
- Gerard.

151
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,285
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

152
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,620
They don't know
their own size is all.

153
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,789
Good man.

154
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,659
I have 100,000 men
at my command.

155
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,295
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

156
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:50,665
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

157
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,403
It's a game to you,
isn't it?

158
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:56,705
- I pity them.
- Why?

159
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,607
Because it won't last.

160
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:02,912
Because they are the Knights of summer
and winter is coming.

161
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:08,586
Brienne, escort
Lady Catelyn to her tent.

162
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,623
- She's tired from her journey.
- <i>At once, Your Grace.</i>

163
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,892
- Shall I return after?
- <i>That won't be necessary.</i>

164
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:17,262
I would pray awhile.
Alone.

165
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,565
If you'll follow me,
My Lady.

166
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:26,204
You fought bravely today,
Lady Brienne.

167
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,606
I fought for my King.

168
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,309
Soon I'll fight for him
on the battlefield.

169
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:34,011
Die for him
if I must.

170
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:38,215
And, if it please you,
Brienne's enough.

171
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:40,451
I'm no lady.

172
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:13,752
What are you doing here?

173
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,988
I live here.

174
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:20,126
- Are you angry with me, brother?
- You lying bitch.

175
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,162
It's not my fault
you didn't recognize me.

176
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:26,432
Recognize you?
How could I?

177
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,334
The last time I saw you...

178
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,871
You looked like
a fat little boy.

179
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,541
You were a fat
little boy, too,

180
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:38,111
but I recognized you.

181
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,579
Why didn't you tell me?

182
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:41,649
I wanted to see
who you were first.

183
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,684
And I did.

184
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:48,957
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

185
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,859
- Father.
- Father.

186
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:55,696
The wolf pup
has gone south

187
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:59,266
with the entirety of the northern
army at his back.

188
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,602
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

189
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:04,371
the north is ripe
for the taking.

190
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:08,008
The Ironborn will reave and
pillage as it was in the old days

191
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,043
all along the northern coast.

192
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:13,114
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

193
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:16,017
<i>securing the Neck</i>
<i>and everything above.</i>

194
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:18,954
Every stronghold will yield
to us one by one.

195
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,657
Winterfell may defy us
for a year, but what of it?

196
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,693
The rest shall be ours--

197
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:27,197
forest, field and hall.

198
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:34,137
Yara, my daughter,
you'll take 30 longships

199
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,040
<i>to attack Deepwood Motte.</i>

200
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,142
I've always wanted
a castle.

201
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,844
And what's my role
in all this?

202
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:45,983
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

203
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,751
A ship?

204
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,820
You give her 30
and I get one?

205
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:53,357
The sea bitch. We thought
she'd be perfect for you.

206
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:56,961
I'm to fight fishermen?

207
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:59,398
Be careful
of their nets.

208
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:06,740
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

209
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,542
He won't give up
the North so easily.

210
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,377
They won't even know we're
there until it's too late.

211
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:11,711
What do you
know of it, woman?

212
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm a proven warrior.

213
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:16,616
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

214
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,286
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

215
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:23,789
I'm not protecting anyone.

216
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,091
I just wonder
if it's not wiser to wait.

217
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:29,828
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

218
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,497
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

219
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,967
But if we pledge
fealty to them,

220
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,036
they'll give us
Casterly Rock.

221
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,074
What are our words?

222
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,942
Our words?

223
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,149
- "We do not sow."
- "We do not sow."

224
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,951
We are Ironborn.

225
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,820
We're not subjects.
We're not slaves.

226
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:54,957
We do not plow the fields
or toil in the mine.

227
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,994
We take what is ours.

228
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:01,531
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

229
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,204
You act as if
I volunteered to go.

230
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:11,207
You gave me away,
if you remember.

231
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:13,543
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

232
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,845
After he crushed you.

233
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,747
Did you take
what was yours then?

234
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,386
You gave me away!

235
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,556
Your boy!

236
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,959
Your last boy!

237
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:32,762
You gave me away like I was some dog
you didn't want anymore.

238
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:36,166
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

239
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:49,479
You'd have our father bow
down to your other family?

240
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:52,081
I have no other family.

241
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,150
Don't you?

242
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,687
Make your choice, Theon,
and do it quickly.

243
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:00,490
Our ships sail
with or without you.

244
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,303
You won't let me
leave this room.

245
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,340
- You won't let me--
- Shh, shh, keep your voice down.

246
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,446
Why? You think your father
can hear me?

247
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,115
He's 300 miles away!

248
00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:31,153
I don't intend for you
to stay here.

249
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,090
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

250
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:37,793
Again, only temporary.

251
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:40,362
Every man who has
tasted my cooking

252
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,398
has told me what
a good whore I am.

253
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,400
But you wouldn't
be a cook.

254
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,137
You'd pose
as a scullion.

255
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:51,374
Scullion?
What is a scullion?

256
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:54,077
Kitchen wench.

257
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,780
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but--

258
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:58,308
Cleaning pots?

259
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,901
Is that how my lion
wants to see me?

260
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:03,720
Your lion wants
to see you alive.

261
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:06,189
We've come to
a dangerous place.

262
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:08,024
My sister wants to hurt me.

263
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,226
She'll look for any
weakness she can find.

264
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,128
She can't know about you.

265
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,263
I'm the weakness?

266
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,764
It's a compliment,
My Lady.

267
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,467
How is being a weakness
a compliment?

268
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,239
Language can be
a bit tricky here.

269
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:28,109
Oh, I'm too stupid
to understand.

270
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,511
The stupid foreign girl.

271
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:36,250
I am not
a kitchen wench.

272
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:03,476
When will Joffrey
and Sansa be married?

273
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,044
Soon, darling,
when the war is over.

274
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,980
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

275
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:11,450
and another for the feast.

276
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:14,553
But yours will be ivory
since you're the bride.

277
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,894
The Princess
just spoke to you.

278
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,997
Pardon, Your Grace.

279
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,668
I'm sure your dress will
be beautiful, Myrcella.

280
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:31,238
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

281
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:35,342
and I can pledge my love to
the King in sight of the Gods.

282
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,814
Is Joffrey going to kill
Sansa's brother?

283
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:46,418
He might.

284
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:50,488
Would you like that?

285
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,659
No.
I don't think so.

286
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:59,564
Even if he does,
Sansa will do her duty.

287
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,335
Won't you, little dove?

288
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,954
Come in.

289
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,126
Who are you?

290
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,062
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

291
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:34,499
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

292
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,904
- You're not from here.
- No.

293
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,547
What are you doing?

294
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,449
Waiting for you
to tell me what to do.

295
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,718
I shouldn't have to tell
you to do things.

296
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,988
You should just do them.

297
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,190
What things?

298
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:57,292
Change my linens,
wash my clothing,

299
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:00,929
scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot,
brush my hair.

300
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,606
- No.
- You said to brush--

301
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,442
Not now.

302
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,880
Your chamber pot
is empty.

303
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:21,183
Clean the table.

304
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,590
Have you ever been
a handmaiden before?

305
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:30,659
- Yes.
- For whom?

306
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,694
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

307
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:36,598
Lady Zuriff.

308
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:40,336
There is no Lady Zuriff
in this city.

309
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,271
She wasn't in
this city.

310
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:44,707
Well, I don't know how
they did things in that city,

311
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:47,676
but in this city,
handmaidens wait on ladies,

312
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,245
not the other way around.

313
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,181
And I don't have time
to answer 1,000 questions

314
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,683
and teach you
how to do your job.

315
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,521
Do you want me to leave?

316
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,465
Just brush my hair.

317
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,351
Oh, thank the Gods.

318
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,620
I haven't had
a proper shit in six days.

319
00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:32,157
I've encountered this
problem before, My Lord.

320
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:35,694
The stresses of power
often have this

321
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:37,529
insalubrious effect.

322
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:40,698
Two drops
with water daily.

323
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,600
Right. I'm so grateful
to have a man

324
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:45,336
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

325
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:48,239
- Please.
- Thank you, My Lord.

326
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,147
I can trust you,
Pycelle, can I not?

327
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,982
Why, yes, of course,
My Lord.

328
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,185
These are perilous times.

329
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,187
And the crown must forge
new alliances.

330
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,327
And these alliances must often
be sealed in matrimony.

331
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:08,863
Matrimony, huh?

332
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:10,799
Yes.

333
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,034
I'm trusting the council
with these plans,

334
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,803
but the queen mustn't know.

335
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:17,405
We can't have her
meddling in affairs

336
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,785
that could determine
the future of the realm.

337
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,010
There's too much at stake.

338
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:23,144
Oh, yes, yes.
Indeed, yes.

339
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,447
I shall be silent
as the grave.

340
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:30,551
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

341
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:33,054
Princess Myrcella will wed
their youngest son

342
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:36,024
when she comes of age,
ensuring their loyalty

343
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,728
and their army
should we need it.

344
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:42,733
Myrcella sent away
to Dorne?

345
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:47,806
But remember,
the queen mustn't know.

346
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,109
Ooh, "the queen
mustn't know."

347
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:54,679
I love conversations
that begin this way.

348
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:57,949
I plan to marry
Princess Myrcella off

349
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,684
to Theon Greyjoy.

350
00:26:01,254 --> 00:26:03,455
Theon Greyjoy?

351
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:06,224
Forgive me, My Lord,?

352
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:09,127
He grew up a ward
of Winterfell.

353
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:10,795
He fights
for Robb Stark.

354
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:14,365
Precisely. Theon's father
loathes the Starks

355
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,168
and will convince the boy
to come to our side.

356
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:20,671
Greyjoy can destroy
the northern army from within

357
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:23,240
<i>and we can have</i>
<i>his father's ships.</i>

358
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:26,777
But remember,
you must tell no one.

359
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:29,347
Tell no one what?

360
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:33,351
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
Robin Arryn of the Vale.

361
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:38,222
Lysa is not fond of me.

362
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,592
But perhaps the promise
of a royal match

363
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:43,861
will convince her
to let bygones be bygones.

364
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,830
She imprisoned you.

365
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:47,932
She tried
to execute you.

366
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:50,901
And you offer
her son a princess?

367
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:54,771
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

368
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:56,573
an encumbrance,
don't you think?

369
00:26:56,608 --> 00:27:00,978
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

370
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,646
Who better?

371
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:09,252
Yes, I could sing
this song to Lysa,

372
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,521
if I cared to.

373
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:13,757
What's in it
for me?

374
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,896
The gratitude of
the people of Westeros

375
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,631
for helping to end
this war,

376
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:23,836
the adoration of the King for
bringing the Vale back into the fold...

377
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,507
and Harrenhal.

378
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,942
Harrenhal is cursed.

379
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:31,878
Never took you
for a superstitious man.

380
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,812
By all means,
tear it down and rebuild.

381
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,614
You'll be able
to afford it.

382
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:38,450
I plan to make you
Lord of the Riverlands.

383
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,091
With a single stroke,
you'd make me one of the

384
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:43,154
greatest lords in the realm.

385
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:46,423
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

386
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,660
So did Janos Slynt, and he
was given Harrenhal, too.

387
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,596
Until you snatched it away.

388
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,932
I need you to
deliver Lysa Arryn.

389
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,702
I didn't need
Janos Slynt.

390
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:02,574
<i>It's settled, then?</i>

391
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,310
Good.

392
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,748
Oh, and remember--

393
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:11,617
the queen mustn't know.

394
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,159
That must hurt.

395
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,405
What?

396
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,474
What is it?

397
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:12,413
A member of the Kingsguard?

398
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,283
As if I wasn't humiliated
enough already.

399
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:21,823
Brienne is a very
capable warrior.

400
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:25,393
And she's devoted to me.

401
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,631
You're jealous.

402
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:31,567
Jealous?

403
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,769
Of Brienne the beauty?

404
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:35,870
Don't make me laugh.

405
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:41,242
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

406
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:44,579
Not tonight.

407
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:47,248
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

408
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,983
You didn't win
my father's support

409
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:51,152
or his army
on charm alone.

410
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,569
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

411
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:11,572
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

412
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,475
And Margaery's a virgin?

413
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,711
Officially.

414
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:19,081
Shall I bring her
to you?

415
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,781
I should warn you,

416
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,749
I've had quite
a bit of wine.

417
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:52,319
As is your right.
You are a King.

418
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:56,391
You look
very beautiful.

419
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:58,292
Thank you,
Your Grace.

420
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:02,264
- It's a lovely gown.
- <i>You think so?</i>

421
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:05,034
I can't decide
how I like it better.

422
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,170
This way...

423
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:10,207
or this way.

424
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:17,981
You certainly don't need it.

425
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:21,085
Although...

426
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,722
some say that
beauty most desired

427
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:26,524
is the beauty concealed.

428
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:45,211
Must be the wine.

429
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:47,813
Here, let me.

430
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,768
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,970
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

432
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,376
- What?
- He could get you started.

433
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,742
I know he wouldn't mind.

434
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:21,346
Or I can turn over and you
can pretend I'm him.

435
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,152
I don't know what
you're talking about.

436
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,128
There's no need
for us to play games.

437
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:37,365
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

438
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:58,886
Your enemies
aren't happy about us.

439
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:01,255
They want to tear
us apart.

440
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,358
And the best way
to stop them

441
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:07,695
is to put your baby

442
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:10,197
in my belly.

443
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,603
We can try again later.

444
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,505
You decide how
you want to do it--

445
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,407
with me,
with me and Loras.

446
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,910
However else you like.

447
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:26,982
Whatever you need to do.

448
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:32,288
You are a King.

449
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,865
<i>You monster.</i>

450
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,234
Myrcella is my only daughter.

451
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,937
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

452
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:49,505
Myrcella's a Princess.

453
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,173
Some would say
she was born for this.

454
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,875
I will not let you
ship her off to Dorne

455
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,044
as I was shipped off
to Robert Baratheon.

456
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:57,379
Dorne is the safest place
or her.

457
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:00,816
Are you mad?
The Martells loathe us.

458
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,285
That's why we need
to seduce them.

459
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,153
We're going to need
their support in the war

460
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,055
your son started.

461
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,324
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

462
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,961
You won't get away
with this.

463
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:15,931
You think the piece of paper father
gave you keeps you safe.

464
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:21,437
Ned Stark had a piece
of paper, too.

465
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,807
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

466
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:30,045
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

467
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:35,516
<i>Just how safe do you think</i>
<i>Myrcella is if this city falls?</i>

468
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,386
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

469
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,655
Make no mistake.

470
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:44,291
They'll mount her pretty little head
on a spike right beside yours.

471
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:46,626
Get out!
Get out!

472
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:51,056
Theon of
the House Greyjoy,

473
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:54,727
you would this day consecrate
your faith to the drowned God?

474
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,540
- I would.
- <i>Kneel.</i>

475
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,278
Let Theon,
your servant,

476
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:13,482
be born again from
the sea as you were.

477
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:16,251
Bless him with salt.

478
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,423
Bless him with stone.

479
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,225
Bless him with steel.

480
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,533
What is dead
may never die.

481
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,669
What is dead
may never die...

482
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:37,807
But rises again
harder and stronger.

483
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,943
Stand.

484
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:13,312
I don't appreciate being
made a fool of, dwarf.

485
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,847
If Myrcella marries
the Martell boy,

486
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,115
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

487
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,285
No, afraid not.
Sorry about that.

488
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,120
And Harrenhal--

489
00:37:22,154 --> 00:37:25,223
I suppose that's
off the table as well.

490
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:28,960
Yes, I fear so.
Sorry about that, too.

491
00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:31,161
Leave me out of your
next deception.

492
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,197
Oh, that's a shame.

493
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:36,533
You were to be the centerpiece of
my next deception.

494
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:39,837
My brother Jaime rots
in a Northern stockade.

495
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:42,073
I would see him released.

496
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:43,574
That's where you come in.

497
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,077
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

498
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:49,748
No, he won't.
But his mother might.

499
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:52,685
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

500
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,391
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

501
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,360
And he has company.

502
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,765
Filthy old stoat.
Almost hate to interrupt.

503
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,169
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

504
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:17,779
What is the meaning
of this?

505
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:19,815
No, please, please.

506
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:22,250
You disappoint me,
Grand Maester.

507
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:25,020
I am your loyal servant.

508
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,856
So loyal that you told
the Queen about my plans

509
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,486
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

510
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:30,291
No! Never!

511
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:32,961
It's a falsehood.
I swear it.

512
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:34,463
It wasn't me.

513
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,198
Ah, Varys.

514
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:39,334
It was Varys
the spider.

515
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:43,505
See, I told Varys that I was giving
the Princess to the Greyjoys.

516
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,076
I told Littlefinger that I planned
to wed her to Robin Arryn.

517
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,547
I told no one that I was
offering her to the Dornish.

518
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:54,149
No one but you.

519
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:56,718
The eunuch has
spies everywhere.

520
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,154
Cut off his manhood
and feed it to the goats.

521
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:01,623
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

522
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:03,692
Well, make do.

523
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:08,097
How long have you
been spying for my sister?

524
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:10,733
All I did, I did
for House Lannister.

525
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,235
<i>Always. Your lord father,</i>
<i>ask him.</i>

526
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,070
I've always been
his servant

527
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,006
since the days
of the Mad King.

528
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:21,645
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

529
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,481
What?
Oh, no. No.

530
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:29,788
How many hands have you
betrayed, Pycelle?

531
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:32,257
Eddard Stark?
Jon Arryn?

532
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:34,025
Lord Arryn,
he knew.

533
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,995
He knew the truth
about the queen.

534
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,631
And, well,
he planned to act,

535
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,500
to tell King Robert.

536
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:43,834
So you poisoned him?

537
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:46,236
No. Never.

538
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:49,105
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

539
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,674
Lannister--
I always served Lannister.

540
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:54,376
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

541
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:56,278
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, please.

542
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,480
<i>Don't!</i>
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

543
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,283
For your trouble.

544
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:28,175
You'll be pleased to know
our mutual friend

545
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:31,611
<i>is doing quite well</i>
<i>in Lady Sansa's service.</i>

546
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:35,014
Good.
One of my better ideas.

547
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:37,383
And it seems
the Grand Maester

548
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,852
has found his way
into a black cell.

549
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:44,322
Well played,
My Lord Hand.

550
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:47,758
But should I be worried?

551
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,760
Janos Slynt,
Pycelle--

552
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:53,097
the small council
grows smaller every day.

553
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:56,000
The council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

554
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:59,170
I don't mean to follow
Ned Stark to the grave.

555
00:41:00,205 --> 00:41:03,574
Power is a curious thing,
My Lord.

556
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:05,743
Are you fond of riddles?

557
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:07,745
Why, am I about
to hear one?

558
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,214
Three great men
sit in a room.

559
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:12,851
A king, a priest
and a rich man.

560
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,654
Between them stands
a common Sellsword.

561
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:19,625
<i>Each great man bids the</i>
<i>Sellsword kill the other two.</i>

562
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,428
Who lives, who dies?

563
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,698
Depends on the Sellsword.

564
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,867
Does it?
He has neither crown

565
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,136
nor gold nor favor
with the Gods.

566
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,405
He has a sword,
the power of life and death.

567
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,574
But if it's swordsmen
who rule,

568
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:36,110
why do we pretend
Kings hold all the power?

569
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,879
<i>When Ned Stark</i>
<i>lost his head,</i>

570
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,715
<i>who was truly responsible?</i>

571
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,084
Joffrey?
The executioner?

572
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:45,685
Or something else?

573
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,054
I've decided
I don't like riddles.

574
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:55,295
Power resides where
men believe it resides.

575
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,197
It's a trick,

576
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,967
a shadow on the wall.

577
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:03,838
And a very small man

578
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:06,407
can cast a very large shadow.

579
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:48,917
You should be sleeping.

580
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:52,219
Tomorrow's a long march.

581
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:55,222
30 miles if it
don't piss on us.

582
00:42:56,524 --> 00:42:58,158
I can't sleep.

583
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,697
I don't like the taste.

584
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,369
Well...

585
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:14,106
You don't drink it
for the flavor, to be honest.

586
00:43:21,747 --> 00:43:23,214
What?

587
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:26,817
How do you sleep?

588
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:29,053
Same as most men,
I think.

589
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,755
But you've seen things,

590
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:35,059
horrible things.

591
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,729
Aye.

592
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:40,765
I've seen some
pretty things, too,

593
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,035
but not nearly so many.

594
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:46,473
How do you sleep
when you--

595
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:53,013
when you have those
things in your head?

596
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:57,785
You didn't see that.

597
00:43:57,819 --> 00:43:59,387
I made damn sure.

598
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:01,656
I close my eyes
and I see them up there.

599
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,427
All of them

600
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:08,063
standing there--

601
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:10,665
Joffrey,

602
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,268
the Queen,

603
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:15,670
and--

604
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:18,106
and my sister.

605
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:31,018
You know, we've got something
in common, me and you.

606
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:33,387
You know that?

607
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,957
I must have been

608
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:38,460
a couple of years
older than you.

609
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:42,765
I saw my brother stabbed
through the heart

610
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,834
<i>right on our doorstep.</i>

611
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:48,404
<i>He weren't much of a villain</i>
<i>what skewered him.</i>

612
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:51,040
<i>Willem, the lad's name was.</i>

613
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,912
He ran off before
anyone could spit.

614
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:59,149
And I just stood there,

615
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:01,852
watching my brother die.

616
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,156
<i>But here's the funny part.</i>

617
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,393
I can't picture
my brother's face anymore.

618
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:12,062
<i>But Willem--</i>

619
00:45:12,097 --> 00:45:15,066
oh, he was
a nice-looking boy.

620
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:18,869
He had good white teeth,

621
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:21,206
blue eyes,

622
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,976
<i>one of those dimpled chins</i>
<i>all the girls like.</i>

623
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,215
<i>I would think about him</i>
<i>when I was working,</i>

624
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:34,319
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

625
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:36,621
It got to the point

626
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:39,891
where I would say his name
every night before I went to bed.

627
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:42,426
Willem. Willem.

628
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:45,196
<i>Willem.</i>

629
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,398
A prayer almost.

630
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,835
<i>Well, one day...</i>

631
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:56,907
<i>Willem came riding</i>
<i>back into town.</i>

632
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:03,113
I buried an ax so deep
into Willem's skull,

633
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:06,950
<i>they had to bury</i>
<i>him with it.</i>

634
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:10,287
Willem's horse
got me to the Wall

635
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:13,089
and I've been wearing
black ever since.

636
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:19,097
Well...

637
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:22,100
that'll help you sleep, eh?

638
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,542
Ho!

639
00:46:29,576 --> 00:46:32,745
Get up, you lazy
sons of whores!

640
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:35,648
Arm yourselves.

641
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:37,316
- Get up.
- Get up.

642
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:39,218
Keep out of sight,
both of you.

643
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:40,786
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

644
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,055
Keep out of sight.

645
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:45,657
If things go wrong,
you run.

646
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:46,920
Do you hear me?

647
00:46:46,945 --> 00:46:49,627
You run along North
and don't look back.

648
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,397
Hey, there's men
out there

649
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:54,667
who want to fuck
your corpses.

650
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:57,369
Outside, now!

651
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:00,640
<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

652
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:04,111
Gold Cloaks!

653
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:11,953
Everyone out!

654
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:19,594
Hey, you!
Open the damn cage!

655
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,934
Where's the bastard, Crow?

656
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,738
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

657
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:30,507
Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman
to Lord Tywin Lannister.

658
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:34,711
<i>These men from the capital</i>
<i>requested our assistance.</i>

659
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:36,612
Drop your weapons
in the name of the King.

660
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:38,681
Now, which King
would that be?

661
00:47:38,715 --> 00:47:40,616
This is your last chance.

662
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,351
In the name
of King Joffrey,

663
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:45,620
drop your weapons.

664
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:51,091
I don't think I will.

665
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,293
So be it.

666
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:59,533
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

667
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:39,475
Boy, come here.
Boy!

668
00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:43,045
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

669
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:44,346
Help us, boy!

670
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:50,919
A man can fight!
Free us!

671
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,895
Quick, give it to me.

672
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:04,099
Give me the ax.
Give me that.

673
00:49:12,475 --> 00:49:14,108
<i>Put 'em on the wagon!</i>

674
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:16,110
<i>There's more here.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

675
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:24,885
What do we have here?

676
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,886
No!

677
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:30,356
That's a fine
little blade.

678
00:49:30,391 --> 00:49:32,792
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

679
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:34,627
I yield!
I yield!

680
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:36,897
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

681
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:38,999
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

682
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,170
You heard him.
You're coming with us.

683
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:44,706
I yield!

684
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:51,080
Help!

685
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,216
Help me!

686
00:49:56,753 --> 00:49:58,454
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

687
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,490
Look at it.

688
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:09,966
Can you walk?

689
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,735
No.
You got to carry me.

690
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:15,939
All right.

691
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:31,789
Carry him, he says.

692
00:50:40,365 --> 00:50:42,766
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

693
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:45,803
<i>Give him up</i>

694
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:48,105
or I'll start
taking eyeballs.

695
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,186
You want Gendry?

696
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:07,925
You already got him.

697
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:14,598
<i>He loved that helmet.</i>

698
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:33,068
