2
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:08,953
Summoned to court to answer for
the crime of your bannerman,

3
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,834
Gregor Clegane, The Mountain.

4
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:16,287
Arrive within a fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown.

5
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:22,250
Poor Ned Stark. Brave man,
terrible judgement.

6
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,025
Attacking him was stupid.

7
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,914
Lannister...

8
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,912
don't act like fools.

9
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,177
You're gonna say
something clever?

10
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:53,326
Go on, say something clever.

11
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:58,876
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

12
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,440
Why is he still alive?

13
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,664
Tyrion?

14
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,226
Ned Stark.

15
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,366
One of our men interfered...

16
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:13,777
speared him through the leg,
before I could finish him.

17
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,337
Why is he still alive?

18
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:19,630
It wouldn't have been clean.

19
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:20,953
Clean?

20
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:26,429
You spent too much time
worrying about what other people think of you.

21
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,828
I could care less what
what anyone thinks of me.

22
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,601
That's what you want people
to think of you.

23
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,054
It's the truth.

24
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:39,129
And you hear them whispering "Kingslayer"
behind your back, doesn't it bother you?

25
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,477
Of course it bothers me.

26
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,667
A lion doesn't concern himself
with the opinion of a sheep.

27
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,955
I suppose I should be grateful
that your varity,

28
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,606
got in a way of your reckelessnes.

29
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm giving you half of our forces.
30.000 men.

30
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:05,422
And we'll bring that to
Catelyn Stark girlhood home...

31
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,542
and remind her that Lannisters
pay their debts

32
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:14,656
I didn't realize you place such
a high value on my brother's life.

33
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,227
He's a Lannister.

34
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,278
Maybe the lowest of the Lannister,
but he's one of us.

35
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:22,842
And everyday that he remain a prisoner

36
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,606
the less our name command respect.

37
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:30,478
- So the lion does concern himself with the opinion...
- No, that's not an opinion, it's a fact.

38
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,509
If another house can seize
one of our own

39
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,856
and hold him captive, with impunity...

40
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,992
we are no longer house to be feared.

41
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,541
Your mother is dead.

42
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,528
Before long I'll be dead.

43
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:50,728
and you...

44
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,290
and your brother...

45
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:55,167
and your sister and all of her children...

46
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:59,419
all of us dead,
all of us rotting underground.

47
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:03,104
Is the family name
that lives on.

48
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,341
It's all that lives on.

49
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:10,233
Not your personal glory
not your honor... but family.

50
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,591
You understand?

51
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,994
You're blessed with ability
that few men possess.

52
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,009
You're blessed you belong to
the most powerful family in the kingdom.

53
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,819
And you still blessed
with youth.

54
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:38,893
And what you've done
with this blessing?

55
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:43,708
You served as the glorified bodyguard
for two kings..

56
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,731
One a mad man, the other are drunk.

57
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,959
The future of our family will be
determined in these next few months.

58
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,546
We could established a dinasty
that would last a thousand years...

59
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,680
or we could collapse into nothing.
As the Targaryen's did.

60
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:10,681
I need you to become a man
you're always meant to be.

61
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:13,627
Not next year, not tomorrow...

62
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,877
Now.

63
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,678
You're in pain.

64
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,978
I've had worse, my lady.

65
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,065
Perhaps it's time to go hoome.

66
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,466
The south doesn't seems to agree with you..

67
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,041
I knwo the truth Jon Arryn died for..

68
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,817
Do you, lord Stark?

69
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,238
Is that why you called me here?
To pose me riddles?

70
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:12,673
Has he done this before?

71
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:15,979
Jaime would've killed him.

72
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,690
My brother's worth
a thousand of your friend.

73
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:20,778
Your brother...

74
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,591
or your lover?

75
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:30,913
Targaryens wed brothers and sisters
for 300 years..

76
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,591
to keep bloodlines pure.

77
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,355
Jaime and I are more than
brother and sister.

78
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,441
We shared a womb.

79
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:40,444
Came to this world together,
we belong together.

80
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,156
My son saw you with him.

81
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,157
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

82
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:55,335
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.

83
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,609
Thank the Gods.

84
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,126
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

85
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,950
I finished him off another ways

86
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:05,193
- In the morning he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

87
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:06,549
Hated him?

88
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:08,567
I worshipped him.

89
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,706
Every girl in the southern kingdom
dreamt of him but he was mine by oath.

90
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:16,930
And when I finally saw him on our wedding day
in the Sept of Baelor.

91
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:21,556
lean and fierce, and black beared
it was the happiest moment of my life.

92
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:25,280
And that night he crawl on top of me,
stinking of wine

93
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:28,399
and did what he did what little he could do

94
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:32,492
and whispered in my ear : "Lyanna".

95
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,240
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

96
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,032
and he loved her more than me.

97
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:44,530
When the king return from his hunts,
I'll tell him the truth.

98
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:47,657
You must be gone by then...
you and your children.

99
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,220
I will not have that blood on my hands.

100
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,488
Go as far away as you can..

101
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,312
With as many men as you can.

102
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,163
Because wherever you go...

103
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,914
Robert's wrath will follow you.

104
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:02,426
And what of my wrath, lord Stark?

105
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,300
You should have taken the realm
for yourself.

106
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:08,589
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

107
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,351
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

108
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,840
All you needed to do is claim the step
yourself. Such a sad mistake.

109
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:19,217
I've made many mistakes in my life..

110
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:22,042
but that wasn't one of them.

111
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,442
Oh, but it was.

112
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,230
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

113
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,843
There is no middle ground.

114
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,766
No, No, No, No..

115
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,634
is that what they teach you
up in the North?

116
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:30,119
And you, wherever you're from.

117
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:34,744
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

118
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,244
Either of you understand the thing that I'm saying?

119
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,496
Yes, my lord.

120
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:43,869
Lets start over. Shall we?

121
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:48,558
You be the man, and you be the woman.

122
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:54,908
Go ahead.

123
00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:58,844
Slowly.

124
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:12,932
You're not fooling them,
they just paid you, they know what you are.

125
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:15,684
They know its all just an act

126
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:18,744
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

127
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,493
And that takes time.

128
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,850
You need to..

129
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:25,746
ease into it.

130
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,370
Go ahead.

131
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:33,058
Ease into it.

132
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,121
He's winding you over,
inspite of yourself.

133
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,434
You starting to like this.

134
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,005
He wants to believe you.

135
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:52,673
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough

136
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:54,058
to play with a boy, shouldn't you?

137
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,531
He knows, he's better than other men.

138
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:01,245
He's always known it deep down inside
now he has proof.

139
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:02,822
He's so good...

140
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:08,309
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there.

141
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:11,247
Overcoming your very nature..

142
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,636
Why don't you join us, my lord?

143
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,134
I'm saving myself for another.

144
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,843
What she doesn't know
will not hurt her?

145
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,323
A stupid saying..

146
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:27,734
What we don't know is usually
what get us killed.

147
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,434
She must be very beautiful.

148
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:34,398
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines, though.

149
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,371
I do believe my lord in love.

150
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,634
For many years.
Most of my life really.

151
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,600
Play with her ass.

152
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,401
And she loved me too.

153
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:46,202
I was her little confidant.

154
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:51,003
A play thing. She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

155
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:55,604
She told me about
all the horses that she liked.

156
00:12:55,605 --> 00:13:00,005
The castle that she want to live in.
The man that she wanted to marry.

157
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:02,207
A northener..

158
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,608
with a jaw like an anvil.

159
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:09,908
So I challenged him to a duel. I mean,
why not? I'd read all the stories.

160
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,500
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

161
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,400
In the end...
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

162
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:21,101
"He's just a boy", she said.

163
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,202
"Please don't hurt him".

164
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:28,203
So he gave me a nice little scar to remember
and by enough they went

165
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:30,704
- And she still married to him?
- Oh, no.

166
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,605
He got himself killed before the wedding.

167
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:39,006
And she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive spciment.

168
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:41,607
She love him, I'm afraid.

169
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,508
And why wouldn't she, I mean?

170
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:47,008
Who could compare to him,
he just so...

171
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:54,703
good.

172
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,204
Do you know what I learned
losing that duel?

173
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,605
I learned that I'll never win.

174
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,906
Not that way.
That's their game.

175
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:08,007
Their rules.

176
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,808
I'm not going to fight them.

177
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,409
I'm going to fuck them.

178
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,110
That's what I know, that's what I am.

179
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:20,211
And only by admitting what we are,
can we get what we want.

180
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,612
And what do you want?

181
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:26,113
Oh, everything, my dear.

182
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,314
Everything there is.

183
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,815
Now wash yourself,
both of you are working tonight.

184
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:07,851
You're very lucky girl,
do you know that?

185
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,570
Where I come from we don't show mercy
to criminals.

186
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:18,332
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord..

187
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,992
the low tide will lay you on your back,
on the beach..

188
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,732
your hands and feet chained to four stakes..

189
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,712
sea will coming cloaser and closer.

190
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:32,222
You'll see death creeping toward you,
a few inches at a time.

191
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:34,985
Where do you come from?

192
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:37,061
The Iron Islands.

193
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,099
They far away?

194
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,429
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

195
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:45,281
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

196
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,509
Trust me, my lord.

197
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:53,696
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

198
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:57,836
In civilised land, you advert
your betters by their proper titles.

199
00:15:58,432 --> 00:15:59,672
And what's that?

200
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,172
Lord.

201
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:02,783
Why?

202
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,074
Why?

203
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,643
What do you mean "why"?

204
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:10,986
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
lord of the Iron Islands.

205
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,955
What's that got to do with you?

206
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:18,111
Your father's lord,
how can you be lord too?

207
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:22,353
- I will be lord after my father..
- So you're not lord now.

208
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,469
No, you...

209
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,596
You having a go at me?

210
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:28,795
Is that it?

211
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:32,324
Just don't understand
how you southerner do things.

212
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:33,654
I'm not a southerner.

213
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,906
You're from south of The Wall...

214
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:38,707
that make you southerner to me.

215
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,872
You're an impudent little wench,
aren't you?

216
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:48,542
Couldn't say, my lord.
Didn't know what impunent means.

217
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,040
Impudent. It means rude.

218
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:54,011
Disrespectful.

219
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:00,171
Do you want to loose that chain?

220
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:04,346
Theon Greyjoy!

221
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,570
The lady is our guest.

222
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,148
Thought she was our prisoner.

223
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:12,856
Are the two mutually exclusive,
in your experience?

224
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,419
Chances are I won't be nearby 
the next time that happens.

225
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:28,658
I'm used to worst than him.

226
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:32,410
I'm used to men
that can chew that boy up.

227
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:34,784
And pick their teeth with his bones.

228
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:42,521
Why did you come here?

229
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,859
Didn't mean to come here.

230
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:50,217
Meant to get much further south
than this. As far as south as south goes.

231
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,216
Before the long night comes.

232
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:54,782
Why?

233
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,381
What do you afraid of?

234
00:17:57,294 --> 00:18:01,392
Those thing that sleep in the day
and hunt at night

235
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:06,015
- Owl and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owl and shadowcats.

236
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,422
The thing you speak of..

237
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,805
have been gone for thousand of years.

238
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,794
It wasn't gone, old man.

239
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:20,995
They were sleeping.

240
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,581
And they're sleeping no more.

241
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,993
I missed girls.

242
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:38,800
Not even talking to them,
I never talk to them.

243
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:42,397
Just lookin' at them.

244
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:44,081
Hearing them giggle.

245
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:51,574
Don't you missed girls?

246
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,006
Riders!

247
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,739
The horn. We have to blow the horn.

248
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:03,906
Why is he alone?

249
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:09,010
One blast for a ranger returning

250
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,794
Two for wildlings

251
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,644
- Three..
- He's no rider.

252
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,941
That's my uncle Benjen rode..

253
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:58,610
where's my uncle?

254
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:03,943
Ned!

255
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,718
Robert...

256
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,721
we are hunting... a boar...

257
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,595
I should have spent more time with you.

258
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:24,180
Shown to you how to be a man.

259
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:30,402
I was never meant to be a father.

260
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:51,432
Go on....

261
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,470
you don't want to see this.

262
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,114
My fault..

263
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,381
Too much wine..

264
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:15,070
Missed my thrust..

265
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,820
Stinks.

266
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,652
Stinks like death.

267
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,042
Don't think I can't smell it.

268
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:38,167
Pay the bastard back, Ned.

269
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,056
I drove my knife
right through his brain

270
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:43,317
You ask him if I didn't. Ask him!

271
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:49,886
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest
the kingdom ever saw..

272
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:54,741
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me

273
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,594
Now leave us, the lot of you
I need to talk to Ned.

274
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,291
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out! All of you!

275
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:26,783
You damn fool.

276
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,400
Paper and ink. On the table.

277
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:31,301
Write down what I said.

278
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:42,819
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon

279
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,520
First of... you know how it goes.
Put in the damn titles..

280
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:50,927
I hereby command..

281
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:56,028
Eddard of House Stark...
titles..titles...

282
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:02,052
to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of The Realm, upon my death..

283
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,187
to rule in my stead..

284
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:09,286
until my son Joffrey comes of age.

285
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:27,974
Give it over..

286
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,567
Give it to the council..

287
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,568
after I'm death.

288
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:53,729
At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.

289
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,812
You'll rule now.

290
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:59,425
You'll hate it worse than I did..

291
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:01,810
but you'll do it well.

292
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:07,535
The girl..

293
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:09,836
Daenerys...

294
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:13,237
you're right.

295
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:17,423
Varys, Littlefinger, my brother..
Worthless..

296
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:20,476
Noone to tell me "No" but you.

297
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:23,777
Only you.

298
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:29,603
Let her live

299
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:34,604
- Stop it if its not to late.
- I will.

300
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:36,910
My son...

301
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,111
help him, Ned.

302
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,459
Make him better than me

303
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:45,619
I'll...

304
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:50,450
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

305
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,216
My memory?

306
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:58,087
King Robert Baratheon...

307
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:01,388
murdered by a pig.

308
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:08,312
Give me something to the pain,
and let me die.

309
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:24,948
Give him milk of the poppy.

310
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,861
He was reeling from the wine..

311
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:38,525
He commanded us to...

312
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:40,626
step aside, but...

313
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,383
I failed him.

314
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:49,026
No men could've protected him from himself.

315
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:55,801
I wonder, Ser Barristan,
who gave the King this wine?

316
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,611
His squire.
From the King's own skin.

317
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:02,625
His squire? The Lannister boy?

318
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:07,466
Such a dutiful boy to make sure
His Grace did not lack refreshment.

319
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:11,584
I do hope the poor lad
is not blame himself.

320
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:23,997
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

321
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,387
Whatever arrangements you made...

322
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:32,418
unmade them, at once.

323
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:35,810
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

324
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:38,419
The Khaleesi likely dead already.

325
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:21,351
Can you help me make him.. understand?

326
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:24,186
The Dothraki do things on their own time
for their own reason

327
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:27,809
Have patience, Khaleesi. We will
go home, I promise you.

328
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,111
My brother...

329
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,312
was a fool, I know.. but he was
the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

330
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,292
Have I said something funny, ser?

331
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:39,316
Forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor,
Aegon The Conqueror,

332
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,048
didn't seize six of the kingdoms
because it his right.

333
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,780
He have no right to them,
he seized them because he could.

334
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,588
And because he had dragons.

335
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,495
Having few dragons makes things easier.

336
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,822
- You don't believe it?
- Have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?

337
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:57,008
I believe what my eyes and ears report.

338
00:28:57,307 --> 00:29:01,556
As for the rest, it was 300 years ago,
who knows what really happened.

339
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,965
Now if you pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain..

340
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,966
- see if he has any letter for me.
- Well, I'll come with you.

341
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:08,692
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

342
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,029
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

343
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:22,441
Jorah, the Andal?

344
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:28,552
The Spider sent his greetings
and his congratulations.

345
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:32,665
Overall pardon,

346
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:34,517
you can go home now.

347
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:18,953
My son already has his name, but I'll
try your summer wine. Just a taste.

348
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,160
My lady, you are from Westeros?

349
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:25,976
You have the honor of addressing
Daenerys of the House Targaryen.

350
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,086
Khaleesi of the riding men,
and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

351
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:32,599
- Princess.
- Rise.

352
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:35,076
I still like to taste that wine.

353
00:30:35,654 --> 00:30:36,713
That?

354
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:40,714
Dorne's sweet not worthy of a princess.

355
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:43,115
I have the dry red from the Arbor.

356
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,850
Nectar of the Gods.

357
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:47,039
Let me give you a cask.

358
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:49,866
- A gift!
- You honor me, ser.

359
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:52,329
The honor.. the honor is all mine.

360
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:59,296
You know there are many in your homeland

361
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:00,954
that pray for your return, princess.

362
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,952
I hope to repay your kindness someday.

364
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,231
The wine is for the Khaleesi,
it's not for the likes of you.

365
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:16,338
Open it.

366
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:29,161
Pour.

367
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,462
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich
without at least giving it time to breathe.

368
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:34,851
Do as he says.

369
00:31:36,254 --> 00:31:37,953
As the princess command.

370
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,765
Sweet, isn't it?

371
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:54,572
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

372
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,314
Taste it, my lord.

373
00:31:57,902 --> 00:32:01,585
Tell me that is not the finest wine
that has ever touch your tongue.

374
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:06,205
You first.

375
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,953
Me?

376
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,002
I'm afraid I'm not worthy of the vintage.

377
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:16,099
Beside, is it a poor wine merchant
who drink up his own wares

378
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:18,639
You will drink.

379
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:51,727
Come.

380
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:01,860
You came to us as outlaws..

381
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,563
poachers..

382
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:05,198
rapers..

383
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,552
killers, thieves...

384
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:09,122
You came alone..

385
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,001
in chains..

386
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:14,584
without friends, or honor.

387
00:33:15,323 --> 00:33:17,111
You came to us rich..

388
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:19,178
or you came to us poor.

389
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:23,748
Some of you bear the name
of proud houses..

390
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,290
all those only bastard names,
or no names at all.

391
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:32,525
It does not matter.
All that, is in the past.

392
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,129
Here..

393
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,577
on the Wall.

394
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:39,777
we're all one house.

395
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,095
Tonight..

396
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:44,977
We're allowed to look happy..

397
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,073
you're going to be a ranger.

398
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,372
It's not what you always wanted?

399
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,764
I want to find my uncle.

400
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:57,187
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

401
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:01,613
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

402
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:04,439
its the steward's life for me.

403
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:07,379
You're honored being a steward.

404
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,701
Not much, really.

405
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:11,627
But those food.

407
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:19,028
You begin a new.

408
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,674
A man of the Night's Watch.

409
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:33,808
live his life for the realm.

410
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,062
Not for King

411
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,671
or a Lord..

412
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:42,523
or the honor of this house or that house.

413
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:45,566
Not for gold, glory,..

414
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,528
or women's love.

415
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:49,848
But for the realm..

416
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,526
and all the people in it.

417
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:57,104
You all learned the words, your vow

418
00:34:57,202 --> 00:35:00,128
Think carefully before you say them.

419
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,915
The penalty for desertion..

420
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:05,038
is death.

421
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,690
You can take your vows here..

422
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,119
tonight..

423
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:15,794
at sunset.

424
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:19,665
Do any of you still keep the Old Gods?

425
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,238
I do, my lord.

426
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:27,085
Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree, 
as your uncle did?

427
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:28,212
Yes, my lord.

428
00:35:28,322 --> 00:35:31,270
You'll find the weirwoods,
a mile north of the Wall..

429
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,421
and your Old  Gods too, maybe.

430
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,302
My Lord?

431
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:38,387
Might I go as well?

432
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:40,699
Is House Tarly keep the Old Gods?

433
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,339
No, my lord..

434
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:45,303
I was name in the light of the Seven..

435
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:48,104
as my father was
and his father before him.

436
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:51,840
Why would you forsake, 
the Gods of your father and your house?

437
00:35:54,257 --> 00:35:56,887
The Night's Watch is my house now.

438
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:59,574
The Seven have never answer my prayers..

439
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,061
perhaps the Old Gods will.

440
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:04,836
As you wish.

441
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:09,050
You all been,
assigned an order..

442
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:11,636
according to our needs..

443
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,337
and your strength.

444
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:16,597

May all the Gods preserve you.

461
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,639
Rangers, with me.

462
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:03,712
Builders!

463
00:37:23,322 --> 00:37:24,411
Samwell...

464
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:27,737
you will assisst me in the rookery 
and the library.

00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:32,064
you will report to Bowen Marsh, 
in the kitchen.

467
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:36,229
Luke, report to One Eye Joe in the stable..

468
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:40,647
Dareon, I'm sending you to the east watch..

469
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,539
present yourself to Borcas when you arrive..

470
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:47,046
Make no comment about his nose.

471
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:49,609
Jon Snow...

472
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:54,026
Lord Commander Mormont has requested you 
for his personal steward.

473
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,151
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meal,

474
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,140
and fetch hot water for his bath?

475
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:00,173
Certainly.

476
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:02,874
And keep the fire burning in his chambers..

477
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,675
change his sheets 
and blankets daily..

478
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:09,563
and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.

479
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,124
You take me for a servant?

480
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:17,145
We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.

481
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:20,085
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

482
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,013
May I go?

483
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,714
As you wish.

484
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:31,746
Jon! Wait!

485
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:35,455
- Don't you see what they're doing?
- I see ser Alliser revenge thats all..

486
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:37,255
he wanted it and he got it.

487
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,519
Steward are nothing
but maid!

488
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,194
I'm a better swordman and rider than any of you!

489
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:43,650
It's not fair!

490
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:45,296
Fair?

491
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:47,908
I was singing for a high lord 
at Acorn Hall,

492
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,822
when he put his hand in my leg 
and he wanted to see my cock.

493
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:52,393
I pushed him away and he said..

494
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:54,935
he'd have my hand cut off 
for stealing when he's over.

495
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:56,875
So now I'm here,
at the end of the world,

496
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,825
where noone to sing a folk,
but old men and little shit like you.

497
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:01,753
I'll never see my family again.

498
00:39:01,754 --> 00:39:05,198
I'll never been inside a women again.
Don't tell me about fair.

499
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,224
I thought you were caught stealing 
a wheel of cheese..

500
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:09,112
for your starving sister.

501
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,200
Course who's gonna teel a bunch of strangers..

502
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,404
a high lord try to grab my cock?

503
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,744
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?

504
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:20,064
I'd like to hear a song.

505
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:25,864
Now listen to me..

506
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:29,617
the old man, is the Lord Commander 
of The Night's Watch.

507
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:34,313
You will be with him, day and night,
yes.. you will clean his clothes.

508
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:36,670
You will also, take his letters..

509
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:39,944
attend him at meeting, 
squire for him at battle.

510
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:43,503
You'll know everything, 
be part of everything.

511
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:46,154
And he ask for you himself.

512
00:39:46,814 --> 00:39:49,713
He wants to groom you for command.

513
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,990
I just...

514
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,513
I always wanted to be a ranger.

515
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,772
I always wanted to be a wizard.

516
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:08,383
What?

517
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,252
No, I'm serious.

518
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:13,063
So you'll stay and say your word with me?

519
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:20,862
Lord Stark.

520
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:22,752
A moment?

521
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:25,542
Alone, if you will.

522
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:37,542
He name you Protector of The Realm.

523
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:40,362
He did.

524
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,342
She won't care.

525
00:40:42,422 --> 00:40:45,382
Give me an hour and I'll put 
a hundred of swords at your command.

526
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,411
- And what should I do with a hundred swords?
- Strike!

527
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:51,921
Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

528
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:55,391
We must get Joffrey away from his mother 
and into our custody.

529
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:59,331
Protector of The Realm or no, 
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

530
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:03,620
Every moment you delay, 
gives Cersei another moment to prepare.

531
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:06,513
By the time Robert die,
it would be late for the both of us.

532
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,161
What about Stannis?

533
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:12,111
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei 
and delivering him to Stannis?

534
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:14,700
You have odd notion about 
"protecting the realm".

535
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:16,370
Stannis is your older brother.

536
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:18,911
This isn't about the bloody line of succession.

537
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:20,874
That didn't matter when you rebelled 
against the Mad King..

538
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,592
it shouldn't matter now.

539
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:26,726
What's the best for the kingdoms?

540
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:29,695
What's best for the people we rule?

541
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,146
We all know what Stannis is..

542
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:36,576
He inspires no love, or loyalty.

543
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:38,496
He's not a king.

544
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:41,395
I am.

545
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,025
Stannis is a commander.

546
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:53,334
He's led men into war, twice.

547
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:56,744
- He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
- Yes. he's a good soldier, everyone knows that.

548
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:58,435
so is Robert.

549
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:03,345
Tell me something. Do you still believe
good soldier made good king?

550
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:12,675
I will not dishonor Robert's last hour 
by shedding blood in his house..

551
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:16,214
and dragging frightened children,
from their beds.

552
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:32,064
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

553
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:35,114
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.

554
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:38,244
Not his steward.

555
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:41,504
Not his captain of the guard.

556
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:43,623
And not his wife.

557
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:51,394
Only Stannis himself.

558
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:54,153
Yes, my lord.

559
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,693
Now leave us.

560
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,183
My lord protector.

561
00:43:15,153 --> 00:43:17,351
The king has no trueborn son.

562
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:21,813
Joffrey and Tommen, are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

563
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:27,075
- So when the king dies..
- The throne passes to his brother..

564
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,023
Lord Stannis.

565
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:32,783
So it would seem.

566
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:36,851
- Unless..
- There is no "unless"!

567
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:39,147
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

568
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:41,412
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

569
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:45,512
You would be wise to denied to him.
And to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

570
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:50,552
Do you have a shred of honor?

571
00:43:51,122 --> 00:43:54,615
You're now Hand of The King 
and Protector of The Realm,

572
00:43:54,616 --> 00:44:00,232
all the power is yours, you need only..
reach out and take it.

573
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:03,571
Make peace with the Lannisters.
Release The Imp.

574
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:05,911
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

575
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:08,195
We've plenty of time 
to get rid of Stannis..

576
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,805
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems 
when he come into his throne..

577
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:14,319
we simply reveal his little secret..

578
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,216
- and sit Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

579
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:21,251
You'll need someone to share this burdens,
I assure you..

580
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,901
my price would be modest.

581
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,911
Would you suggest this treason?

582
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,260
Only if we lose.

583
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,040
Make peace with the Lannisters you say..

584
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:38,068
The people who tried to murder my boy.

585
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:43,861
We only make peace with our enemy, my lord.
That's why its called making peace.

586
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,330
No...

587
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,530
I won't do it.

588
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,880
- So it will be Stannis? and war?
- There is no other choice.

589
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,470
He is the heir.

590
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,370
So why did you call me here?
Not for my wisdom clearly.

591
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,000
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

592
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,109
The queen had a dozen knights 
and hundred man-at-arms.

593
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,650
Enough to overwhelm what remain 
of my household guard.

594
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,439
I need the Gold Cloaks.

595
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:15,330
The City Watch is two thousand strong.

596
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:18,319
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

597
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,719
Look at you.

598
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:27,839
You know what you want me to do.
You know it has to be done.

599
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,449
But it's not honorable, so...

600
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,159
the words stick in your throat.

601
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:37,702
When the Queen proclaims one king,
and the Hand proclaim another..

602
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:41,009
who's peace to the Gold Cloaks protect?

603
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:44,168
Who do they follow?

604
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:51,039
The man who pays them.

605
00:46:36,388 --> 00:46:40,758
Hear my words, 
and bear witness to my vow

606
00:46:40,818 --> 00:46:44,278
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.

607
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:47,326
It shall not end until my death.

608
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:53,357
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

609
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:57,321
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.

610
00:46:57,587 --> 00:47:00,934
I shall live and die at my post.

611
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:03,730
 I am the sword in the darkness.

612
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:06,637
 I am the watcher on the walls.

613
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:10,593
I am the shield that guards the realm of men.

614
00:47:10,986 --> 00:47:15,134
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,

615
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:18,635
 for this night and all the nights to come.

616
00:47:18,945 --> 00:47:20,876
You knelt as boys..

617
00:47:21,145 --> 00:47:23,955
rise now as men 
of the Night's Watch.

618
00:47:37,043 --> 00:47:39,303
Welcome.. Welcome..

619
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,541
What he's got there?

620
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,089
To me, Ghost.

621
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,850
Bring it here.

622
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,499
Gods be good.

623
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:03,202
What will they do to him?

624
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:08,141
When the khalasar rides..

625
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:12,635
he'll be leashed to the saddle and forced 
to run behind the horses, as long as he can.

626
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:14,492
And when he falls?

627
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:18,892
I saw a man last nine miles once.

628
00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,583
King Robert still wants me dead.

629
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:25,602
This poisoner was the first, 
he won't be the last.

630
00:48:25,722 --> 00:48:29,221
I thought he'd leave me alone,
now that my brother is gone.

631
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:31,561
He will never leave you alone.

632
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:35,521
If you ride to Asshai, 
his assassins will follow you.

633
00:48:35,522 --> 00:48:39,311
If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle,
his spy would tell him.

634
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:42,071
He will never abandon the hunt.

635
00:48:42,912 --> 00:48:44,711
You are Targaryen.

636
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:46,660
The last Targaryen.

637
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:49,065
Your son will have Targaryen blood..

638
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:51,421
with 40.000 riders behind him.

639
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,491
He will not have my son.

640
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:57,921
He will not have you either, khaleesi.

641
00:52:00,373 --> 00:52:01,743
Lord Stark!

642
00:52:02,303 --> 00:52:04,222
- Stop!
- It's alright.

643
00:52:04,552 --> 00:52:06,945
- It's alright. Let him through.
- Lord Stark...

644
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,533
King Joffrey and the queen regent
request you presence in the throne room.

645
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:11,436
King Joffrey?

646
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:14,723
King Robert is gone.
The Gods give him rest.

647
00:52:27,123 --> 00:52:29,616
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is youts.

648
00:52:29,617 --> 00:52:30,968
Good.

649
00:52:31,868 --> 00:52:33,847
Is Lord Renly joining us?

650
00:52:35,507 --> 00:52:39,057
I fear Lord Renly
has left the city.

651
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:42,550
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn..

652
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:46,707
with ser Loras Tyrell
and some fifty retainers.

653
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:50,757
Last seen galloping south in some haste.

654
00:53:11,116 --> 00:53:13,067
We stand behind you, lord Stark.

655
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:27,267
All hail His Grace, 
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister.

656
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:28,739
The First of His Name,

657
00:53:29,056 --> 00:53:31,267
The King of The Andal, and The First Men..

658
00:53:31,426 --> 00:53:36,513
Lord of The Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of The Realm.

659
00:53:54,656 --> 00:53:58,824
I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.

660
00:53:58,825 --> 00:54:01,366
I wish to be crowned within the forthnight.

661
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:06,375
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty
from my loyal councillors.

662
00:54:10,505 --> 00:54:11,845
Ser Barristan...

663
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:16,175
I believe no men here 
could ever question your honor.

664
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,336
King Robert seal.

665
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:29,926
Unbroken.

666
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:40,585
Lord Eddard Stark is herein named..

667
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:42,974
Protector of The Realm..

668
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,978
to rule as regent...

669
00:54:45,979 --> 00:54:48,770
until the heir come of age.

670
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:52,269
May I see that letter, ser Barristan?

671
00:55:00,818 --> 00:55:02,609
Protector of The Realm.

672
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:09,019
Is this meant to be your shield,
Lord Stark?

673
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:11,798
A piece of paper.

674
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:16,757
Those were the king's words.

675
00:55:16,758 --> 00:55:18,699
We have a new king now.

676
00:55:21,078 --> 00:55:25,008
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offer me some counsel.

677
00:55:25,148 --> 00:55:27,289
Allow me to return the courtesy.

678
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,540
Bend the knee, my lord.

679
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,240
Bend the knee 
and swear loyalty to my son.

680
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,485
And we shall allow you to live out the days
in the grey waste..

681
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,111
you called home.

682
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:41,798
Your son has no claim to the throne.

683
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:42,566
Liar!

684
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:45,531
You condemn yourself 
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

685
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,120
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

686
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,609
Ser Barristan is a good man, 
a loyal man, do him no harm.

687
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:56,730
You think you stands alone?

688
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:02,759
Kill him! Kill all of them.
I commanded.

689
00:56:03,048 --> 00:56:04,268
Commander!

690
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:07,427
Take the queen and 
her children to custody.

691
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:11,317
Escort them back to the royal apartment 
and keep them there under guard.

692
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:12,758
Men of the watch!

693
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,008
I want no bloodshed.

694
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:23,998
Tell your men to lay down their swords,
noone needs to die.

695
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:27,388
Now!

696
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:41,718
I did warn you not to trust me.
