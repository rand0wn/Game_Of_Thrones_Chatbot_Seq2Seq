2
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,735
Jon: You alright?

3
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:31,440
Tormund: Haven't been North before?

4
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:33,628
Gendry: Never seen snow before.

5
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,698
..Beautiful, eh?
I can breathe again.

6
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:39,099
Tormund: Down south the air smells like pig shit.

7
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,561
Jon: You've never been down south.
Tormund: I've been to Winterfell.

8
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:43,346
Jon: That's the North.

9
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,555
Gendry: How do you live up here?

10
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,721
...How d'you keep your balls
from freezing off?

11
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,809
Tormund: You've got to keep moving,
that's the secret.

12
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,396
...Walking's good,
fighting's better,

13
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,127
..fucking's best.

14
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,480
Jon: There's not a living woman
within 100 miles from here.

15
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:59,457
Tormund: We've got to make due with what we've got.

16
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,420
Tormund: This one is maybe not so smart.

17
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:09,845
Jon: Davos says he's a strong fighter.
Tormund: Good.

18
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:12,412
...That's more important than being smart.

19
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:15,680
...Smart people don't come here
looking for the dead.

20
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:21,513
Tormund: So, you've met this Dragon queen, huh?
And?

21
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,764
Jon: She will only fight beside us
if I bend the knee.

22
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:28,713
Tormund:You spent too much time with the Free Folk.
Now you don't like kneeling.

23
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:35,060
...Mance Rayder was a great man.
Proud man.

24
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,269
The King Beyond the Wall and everything.

25
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:43,983
How many of his people died
for his pride?

26
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:58,000
Thoros: You still mad at us, boy?

27
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:01,798
Gendry: You sold me to a witch.
Thoros: A priestess.

28
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,911
..I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.

29
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:06,603
Beric: We're fighting a great war.

30
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:09,423
..Wars cost money.
Gendry: I wanted to be one of you.

31
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,166
..I wanted to join the Brotherhood
but you sold me off.

32
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,112
Like a slave.

33
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,076
You know what she did to me?

34
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,971
She struck me down on the bed,
she stripped me naked...

35
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,608
Hound: Sounds alright so far...

36
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:21,956
Gendry: And put leeches on me!

37
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:24,484
Hound: Was she naked too?
Thoros: She needed your blood.

38
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:27,344
Gendry(to Thoros): Yes, thank you, I know that.
Hound: Could've been worse.

39
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,192
Gendry(to Hound): She wanted to kill me.

40
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,776
- And would have killed me if it weren't for...
Hound: But they didn't, did they?

41
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,663
..So what you winging about?

42
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,394
Gendry: I'm not winging.

43
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:40,085
Your lips are moving and you complain
about something. That's winging.

44
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,773
This one has been killed six times and
you don't hear him bitching about it.

45
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,610
Good lad.

46
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:03,098
The first time I went north of the Wall,
was with your father.

47
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:04,790
He was a good man.

48
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,774
He deserved a better son.

49
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,950
Were you with him at the end?

50
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,342
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

51
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,365
But we avenged him.

52
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:18,300
I want you to know that,
every mutineer found justice.

53
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:21,519
Can't think of a worse way for him to go.

54
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,915
The Night's Watch was his life. He would
have died to protect every one of those men.

55
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:27,413
And they butchered him.

56
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,670
I hate that he died that way.

57
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,870
And my father was the most honorable man
I have ever met.

58
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:35,515
He was good, all the way through.

59
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:38,374
And he died on the executioner's block.

60
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:42,226
Your father wanted to execute me,
you know.

61
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,133
I heard.

62
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:46,233
It was in the right, of course.

63
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,529
Didn't make me hate him any less.

64
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,707
I'm glad he didn't catch you.

65
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,683
Your father gave me this sword.

66
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,340
Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.

67
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,286
But it's still Longclaw.

68
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,143
Lord Commander Mormont thought
you'd never come back to Westeros.

69
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,611
But you are back.

70
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,462
And it's been in your family for centuries.

71
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,332
It's not right for me to have it.

72
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,942
He gave it to you.

73
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,699
I'm not his son.

74
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:45,368
I brought shame onto my house.

75
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:49,297
I broke my father's heart.

76
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,840
I forfeited the right to claim his sword.

77
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,672
It's yours.

78
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,870
May it serve you well.

79
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,559
And your children after you.

80
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,291
Father used to watch us from up here.

81
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:32,072
He wouldn't say much.

82
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:35,048
You probably don't remember,
you were inside knitting all the time.

83
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,501
I remember.

84
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:43,408
One times the boys were
shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick,

85
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,312
I came out here after

86
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,471
and Bran had left his bow behind,

87
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,533
just lying on the ground.

88
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,392
Ser Rodrick would have
cuffed him if he saw.

89
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,367
There was one arrow in the target

90
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,830
and with no one around, just like now.

91
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:04,475
No one to stop me.

92
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,665
So I started shooting.

93
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:12,864
And every shot I had to go up there and get my
one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.

94
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,210
I wasn't very good.

95
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,906
Finally, I've hit the bull's eye.

96
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,952
Could've been the 20th shot. Or the 50th.
I don't remember.

97
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,053
But I hit the bull's eye.

98
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,309
And I heard this.(clapping sound)

99
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,129
I looked up.

100
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,441
And he was standing right here,
smiling down on me.

101
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,450
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules

102
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:43,049
but he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

103
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,602
The rules were wrong.

104
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,531
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing and he knew it.

105
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,560
Now he's dead.

106
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,652
Killed by the Lannisters.

107
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,720
With your help.

108
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,568
What?

109
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,316
That's your pretty handwriting.

110
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,446
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles
cause I couldn't write as well as you.

111
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,250
Robb,

112
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,051
I write to you today with heavy heart.

113
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,132
Our good King Robert is dead.

114
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:30,013
- Killed from wounds he took in a bull...
- You don't have to read it.

115
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:32,168
- I remember.
- Father has been charged with treason.

116
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,714
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

117
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,678
and tried to steal his throne.

118
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:40,341
The Lannisters are treating me well
and providing me with every comfort.

119
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:44,343
I beg you, come to King's Landing,
swear fealty to King Joffrey

120
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,986
and prevent any strife between the
great houses of Lannister and Stark

121
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:50,300
Your faithful sister, Sansa.

122
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,471
- They forced me to do it.
- Did they?

123
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,455
With a knife at your throat?

124
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,723
Did they put you in a rack and stretched
you till your bones started to crack?

125
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:01,038
You should have known what it was like.
I was a child.

126
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,011
So was I.

127
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,412
I would have let them kill me
before I betrayed my family.

128
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:07,307
They told me it was the
only way to save father.

129
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:09,855
And you were stupid enough to believe them.

130
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,586
I remember you, standing on that platform

131
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,963
with Joffrey and Cersei when they
dragged father to the block.

132
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,989
I remember the pretty dress you were
wearing, the fancy way you did your hair.

133
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:23,538
- You were there.
- I was there.

134
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,115
Standing in the crown near Baelor's statue.

135
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,590
And what did you do? Did you
come running to the rescue?

136
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,371
Did you fight with the
Lannisters and save father?

137
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:34,829
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't.

138
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,355
- Just like me.
- I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb.

139
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,880
I didn't betray my entire family
for my beloved Joffrey.

140
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:47,314
You should be on your knees thanking me.

141
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:50,557
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

142
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:54,689
You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it
back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards.

143
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,428
The Knights of the Vale won the battle
and they rode north for me.

144
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:01,224
While you were off where? Travelling the world?

145
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:03,670
- I was training.
- Training?

146
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,168
Well, while you were training, I
suffered things you can never imagine.

147
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,814
Oh, I didn't know that and
I can imagine quite a lot.

148
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,461
You never would have
survived what I survived.

149
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,652
I guess we'll never know.

150
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:24,502
What are you going to do with that letter?

151
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,632
I don't know yet.

152
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,852
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

153
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:32,873
You're scared, aren't you?

154
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:37,023
What are you scared of?
You didn't commit any crimes.

155
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,271
No one's gonna hang you.
You're scared I'll show it to Jon

156
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,773
- Arya!
- and he'll be angry.

157
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:43,321
Not, that's not Jon.

158
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,117
He'll understand,
you were just a scared little girl.

159
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,062
All alone with the wicked Lannisters.

160
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:52,385
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

161
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,495
This is exactly what she
wants, what she always wanted.

162
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,735
You are scared the Northern
lords will read it.

163
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,477
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa
if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.

164
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,381
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

165
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,953
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

166
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,016
Are you going to say "But
I was just a child"?

167
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:16,566
You're angry.

168
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:20,453
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

169
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,706
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

170
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,369
I'll go with anger.

171
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:58,073
You're the one they call the dog.

172
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,604
Fuck off.

173
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,683
They told me you were mean.

174
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,749
Were your born mean or
you just hate wildlings?

175
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,264
I don't give two shits about wildlings.

176
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,832
Gingers, I hate.

177
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,274
Gingers are beautiful.

178
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:11,851
Kissed by fire.

179
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,075
Just like you.

180
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,050
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

181
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:22,416
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

182
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,439
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

183
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,306
Ever since, you've been mean.

184
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:27,912
Fuck off.

185
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:29,456
I don't think you're truly mean.

186
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,189
You have sad eyes.

187
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:34,344
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

188
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,274
- Dick?
- Cock.

189
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,577
Ah, dick.

190
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:39,928
I like it.

191
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:41,841
Bet you do.

192
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,343
Nop, it's pussy for me.

193
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,057
I have a beauty waiting for
me back in Winterfell.

194
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,123
If I ever get back there.

195
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,421
Yellow hair,

196
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,940
blue eyes.

197
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,947
Tallest woman you've ever seen.

198
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,026
Almost as tall as you.

199
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,780
Brienne of Tarth?

200
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,222
- You know her?
- You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

201
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,164
Well, not with her yet.

202
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,296
But I see the way she looks at me.

203
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,590
How does she look at you?

204
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,008
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

205
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,647
You do know her.

206
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,937
We've met.

207
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:14,991
I want to make babies with her.

208
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:16,186
Think of them.

209
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,022
Great big monsters.

210
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,665
They conquer the world.

211
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:22,295
How did a mad fucker like you
live this long?

212
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,473
I'm good at killing people.

213
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,779
- You don't look much like him.
- Who's that?

214
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,618
Your father.

215
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,223
I suppose you favor your mother.

216
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:35,891
You knew him?

217
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:37,674
Of course I did.

218
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,529
When he was Hand.

219
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,586
He sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

220
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:44,511
Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman
brought you back.

221
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:47,623
Thoros has brought me back

222
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,304
six times.

223
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:52,058
We both serve the same lord.

224
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,125
I serve the North.

225
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,409
The North did not raise you from the dead.

226
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,176
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

227
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:01,088
I don't know anything about him. I
don't know what he wants from me.

228
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,415
He wants you alive.

229
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,742
- Why?
- I don't know.

230
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:09,355
That's all anyone can tell me.
I don't know.

231
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:13,491
So what's the point of serving a god,
none of us knows what he wants?

232
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:16,232
I think about that all the time.

233
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,095
I don't think it's our purpose to understand.

234
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,078
Except one thing.

235
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,833
We're soldiers.

236
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,198
We have to know what we're fighting for.

237
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:30,293
I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely
know can sit in a throne made of swords.

238
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,249
So what are you fighting for?

239
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:35,008
Life.

240
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:38,023
Death is the enemy.

241
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,027
The first enemy.

242
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,427
And the last.

243
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:44,689
But we all die.

244
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,708
The enemy always wins.

245
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,799
And we still need to fight him.

246
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,678
That's all I know.

247
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,878
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here.

248
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,473
But we can keep up the life.

249
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:00,710
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

250
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:06,392
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

251
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:09,249
Maybe we don't need to
understand anymore than that.

252
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:11,515
Maybe that's enough.

253
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,255
Aye.

254
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,600
Maybe that's enough.

255
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,507
That's what I saw in the fire.

256
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,570
A mountain like an arrow head.

257
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:32,779
Are you sure?

258
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,670
We're getting close.

259
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,810
Do you know what I like about you?

260
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:51,317
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

261
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:53,047
Oh.

262
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,118
I've been heroic on occasion.

263
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,928
I once charged through the Mud Gate
of King's Landing.

264
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:00,641
I don't want you to be a hero.

265
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:03,292
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

266
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,743
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,
even this...

267
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,077
Jon Snow.

268
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,305
They all try to outdo each other.

269
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,013
You can do the stupidest bravest thing...

270
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,253
It's interesting, these heroes you name...

271
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,825
Drogo, Jorah,

272
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,505
Daarios, even this...

273
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,223
Jon Snow...

274
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:23,342
They all fell in love with you.

275
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:24,802
Jon Snow is not in love with me.

276
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,122
Oh, my mistake.

277
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:30,295
I suppose he stares at you longingly because
he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.

278
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,638
He's too little for me.

279
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:38,289
I didn't mean...

280
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,418
Sure *** he is quite little.

281
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,360
I know you're brave.

282
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,543
I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.

283
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:51,264
So...

284
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,796
if all goes well, I'll finally
get to meet your sister.

285
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,524
From everything you've told me about her

286
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,217
she'd rather murder me than speak.

287
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:01,715
Oh...

288
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:05,274
first she'd torture you in some
horrible way, then she'd murder you.

289
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:09,170
Nobody trusts my sister less than I do,
believe me.

290
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,644
But if we go to the capital,

291
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,499
we'll go with two armies,

292
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:14,744
we'll go with three dragons,

293
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:16,026
and anyone touches you,

294
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,146
King's Landing burns down
to the foundation stone.

295
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,208
And right now she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

296
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,328
Of course she is.

297
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:23,619
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

298
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:24,842
Are we?

299
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,431
Laying any traps?

300
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:32,118
If we want to create a
new and better world,

301
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:35,517
I'm not sure deceit and mass murder
are the best ways to start.

302
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:37,711
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?

303
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:43,214
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if
you're going to win the throne.

304
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,479
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

305
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,608
But fear is all Cersei has.

306
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:50,008
It's all my father had...
And Joffrey.

307
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,361
It makes their power brittle.

308
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,876
Because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

309
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,311
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

310
00:18:58,535 --> 00:18:59,555
He did.

311
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:02,257
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

312
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,663
Aegon built the wheel.

313
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,265
If that's the kind of queen you want to be,

314
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:08,630
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

315
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,985
So we walk into the lion's den?

316
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,620
My brother promised me he'd keep
a grip on the Lannister forces.

317
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,944
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

318
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,097
Except yours.

319
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:21,868
And I promised him

320
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:24,544
I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.

321
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,897
Impulsive?

322
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,464
This will be a difficult negotiation.

323
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,946
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

324
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,707
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

325
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:39,827
And?

326
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:43,101
And you've been known to lose
your temper from time to time.

327
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
- As all our great leaders do...
- When have I lost my temper?

328
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,410
Burning the Tarlys for instance.

329
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,029
That was not impulsive.

330
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,232
That was necessary.

331
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,448
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps.

332
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,631
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

333
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:03,138
Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate
the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell.

334
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:06,049
We had no time to discuss the possibility

335
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,979
before you ended their possibilities.

336
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,892
One can be forgiven for thinking you're
taking your family's side in this debate.

337
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,896
I am taking their side.

338
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:14,915
You need to take your enemy's side,


339
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,595
if you're going to see the things they do.

340
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,687
And you need to see things the way they do

341
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:20,477
if you're going to anticipate their actions,

342
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,680
respond effectively and beat them.

343
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,643
Which I want you to do very much.

344
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,199
Because I believe in you

345
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:28,941
and the world you want to build.

346
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,677
But the world you want to build

347
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:35,178
doesn't get build all at once.
Probably not in a single lifetime.

348
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,489
How do we ensure your vision endures?

349
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,925
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

350
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:47,237
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead?

351
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:51,894
You say you can't have children.

352
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:54,757
But there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

353
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,072
The Night's Watch has one method,

354
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,507
The Iron born folk,

355
00:20:58,627 --> 00:20:59,789
among their many flaws...

356
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,229
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

357
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:06,054
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards
you when you fought on Blackwater Rush,

358
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:08,213
and I saw hundred of arrows miss.

359
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,614
But any one of them could have
found your heart and end...

360
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,089
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

361
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,544
Is this one of the items you've discussed
with your brother in King's Landing?

362
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,784
I'm trying to serve you by
planning on the long term.

363
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:20,643
Perhaps if you'd planned
for the short term,

364
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:22,510
we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.

365
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,673
We will discuss the succession

366
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,528
after I wear the crown.

367
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:17,322
A bear.

368
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,122
We can fuck her

369
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,430
The bears have blue eyes.

370
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:31,472
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

371
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,733
flask

372
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:54,128
Go on.

373
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,167
Alright.

374
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,927
I just got bit by a dead bear.

375
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:15,975
Aye.

376
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:17,515
You did.

377
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:21,028
Funny old life.

378
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,798
Alright then.

379
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,612
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

380
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,508
She seems very resourceful.

381
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:00,347
You're worried.

382
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:03,044
We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us

383
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:05,683
in the worst winter any
of them had ever seen.

384
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:08,300
The weather will be the
least of their problems.

385
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:11,421
Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

386
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,621
You question their loyalty?

387
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,661
Their loyalty is to Jon.

388
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:17,195
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

389
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:18,984
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

390
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:21,946
The King chose you to rule in his absence.

391
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:25,024
And rule you have.

392
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:26,592
Wisely.

393
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,127
Ably.

394
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,454
They say that, they respect you.

395
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,505
Some may even prefer you.

396
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,111
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

397
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:35,231
when it was time to retake Winterfell

398
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:38,368
and then they named him their king and now
they're ready to turn their backs on him again.

399
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:40,802
How far would you trust men like that?

400
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:42,784
bloody wind-vanes

401
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,938
If they found out I wrote that letter...

402
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,361
a woman who's already married not
one but two enemies of her House...

403
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:52,318
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

404
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:53,807
Arya is not like them.

405
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,898
She's your sister.

406
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:01,394
You may have disagreements,
but she would never betray her family.

407
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,384
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

408
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,279
Is that what she thinks?

409
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:07,785
I don't know what she thinks.

410
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:09,805
I don't know her anymore.

411
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:13,891
Perhaps Lady Brienne can help.

412
00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:20,320
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark girls.

413
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,079
Did she not?

414
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:24,926
She is.

415
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,672
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

416
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,130
wouldn't she be ***?

417
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:39,223
She would.

418
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,932
Something I've always wanted to know.

419
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,277
Alright.

420
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:58,563
How drunk were you when you charged
through the bridge on Pyke?

421
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:02,671
For being honest, I don't remember
charging through the bridge.

422
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:07,205
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

423
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:10,183
Some damn good scrap.

424
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:11,683
Alright.

425
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,310
It was a proper scrap.

426
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:17,400
The Ironborn thought you were
some kind of god.

427
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:20,525
You were waving that flaming sword.

428
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:24,100
I thought you were the bravest man
I ever saw.

429
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,839
Just the drunkest.

430
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,339
Where's the rest of them?

431
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,501
If we wait long enough
we will find out.

432
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:35,122
Go back to Eastwatch.

433
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:37,338
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

434
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,205
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest.

435
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,338
Go! Now!

436
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:43,808
You're faster without the hammer.
Give it!

437
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,311
Give it!

438
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,512
Stop!

439
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,623
Go!

440
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:04,563
What happened?

441
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:06,836
Where are the others?

442
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:08,393
Raven.

443
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:10,106
We need to send the raven.

444
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:12,197
Get the maester! Now!

445
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:52,738
Thoros?

446
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:57,524
Thoros!

447
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:17,428
I'd say it's one of the better ways to go.

448
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:31,901
Lord of Light,

449
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,315
show us the way.

450
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,978
Come to us in our darkness and
lead your servant into the light.

451
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,038
We have to burn this body.

452
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:50,273
And all the clothes behind him.

453
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:54,507
Unless the Lord of Light is kind
enough to send us a bit of fire.

454
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:07,052
Come to us in our darkness.

455
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,561
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

456
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:35,184
We'll all freeze soon.

457
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:38,025
I saw the water.

458
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:43,878
When you killed the white walker,

459
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,397
almost all the dead that followed him *** .

460
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:49,607
Why?

461
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,968
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

462
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,087
We can go for the walkers.

463
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:58,375
- Maybe we'll stand a chance.
- No.

464
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,095
We need to take that thing back with us.

465
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:07,987
There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.

466
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:10,538
Daenerys is our only chance.

467
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,082
No.

468
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:14,282
There's another.

469
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,849
Kill him.

470
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:20,520
He turned them all.

471
00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:26,759
You don't understand.

472
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,099
The Lord brought you back...

473
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,755
he brought me back...

474
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:33,010
No one else, just us.

475
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,346
Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?

476
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,464
Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest.

477
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:43,684
This is your last life.

478
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,565
I've been waiting for the end for a long time.

479
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,782
Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.

480
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:52,139
Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt.

481
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:55,377
Can't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

482
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:09,616
Milady.

483
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,355
Milady.

484
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,157
It's an invitation.

485
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:25,220
To King's Landing.

486
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:34,144
- Milady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.
- I am.

487
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:37,541
And you will represent my interest
at this gathering as you see them.

488
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,561
They invited you, they want you there.

489
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:44,022
I will not set foot in King's Landing while

490
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:46,169
Cersei Lannister is queen.

491
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:49,533
They want another Stark prisoner,
they can come and take me.

492
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,441
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

493
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,871
I have work to do here.

494
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,389
It's not safe.

495
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:00,284
Ser Jaime will be there.

496
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:02,582
You said he treated you honourably before.

497
00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:04,547
I'm not worried about me.

498
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:07,483
It's not safe leaving
you with Littlefinger.

499
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:11,443
I have many guards who'd happily
imprison him or behead him

500
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:12,762
whether or not you're here.

501
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:14,264
And you trust their loyalty?

502
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,972
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

503
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:21,564
Let me at least leave Podrick
behind to watch over you.

504
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:23,469
He has become a competent swordsman.

505
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:27,245
I do not need to be watched
over or minded or cared for.

506
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,184
I'm not a child, I am the Lady
of Winterfell and I am home.

507
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:33,326
This is the safest place for me.

508
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,191
Milady.

509
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:39,965
I sworn an oath to protect
you and your sister.

510
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:40,943
If I abandon you...

511
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,501
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

512
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:44,718
and you won't be travelling
on summer roads.

513
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:48,014
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

514
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:52,593
Yes, Milady.

515
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:15,479
You can't!

516
00:41:16,837 --> 00:41:20,682
The most important person in the world can't
fly off to the most dangerous place in the world.

517
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:22,586
- Who else can?
- No one.

518
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:24,481
They knew the risk when they left.

519
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:26,581
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

520
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,458
You can't break the wheel if you're dead.

521
00:41:30,425 --> 00:41:32,881
- So what would you have me do?
- Nothing.

522
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,011
Sometimes nothing is the
hardest thing to do.

523
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:39,024
If you die

524
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,059
we're all lost.

525
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,281
Everyone, everything...

526
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:48,535
You told me to do nothing before
and I've listened to you.

527
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:51,014
I'm not doing nothing again.

528
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,353
Dumb cunt.

529
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,195
Oh, fuck.

530
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:39,112
Fall back!

531
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,298
Fall back!

532
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:43,418
Come on!

533
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:09,729
Help me!

534
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:15,647
Jon!

535
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:02,607
Go!

536
00:51:03,084 --> 00:51:06,354
Go now! Leave!

537
00:53:55,294 --> 00:53:56,579
Uncle Benjen!

538
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:01,624
***

539
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:03,017
Come with me.

540
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,613
It's not time.

541
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:06,111
Go!

542
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:19,351
We'll meet again, Clegane.

543
00:55:20,548 --> 00:55:21,994
Fucking hope not.

544
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:53,284
It's time to go, Your Grace.

545
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:56,134
A bit longer.

546
00:58:08,912 --> 00:58:11,429
Not what you're looking for?

547
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:16,977
I have hundreds of men here at
Winterfell, all loyal to me.

548
00:58:17,613 --> 00:58:19,493
They're not here now.

549
00:58:21,223 --> 00:58:25,164
- What are these?
- My faces.

550
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:30,410
- Where did you get them?
- In Braavos,

551
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:33,230
while I was training to be a faceless man.

552
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:36,241
What does that mean?

553
00:58:37,757 --> 00:58:41,758
Back in Braavos, before
I got my first face,

554
00:58:42,244 --> 00:58:46,003
there was I game I used to play.
The game of faces.

555
00:58:47,294 --> 00:58:50,810
It's simple: I ask you a
question about yourself

556
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,630
and you try to make a lie
sound like the truth.

557
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,540
If you fool me, you win.

558
00:58:57,096 --> 00:58:59,976
If I catch a lie, you lose.

559
00:59:00,096 --> 00:59:02,189
Let's play.

560
00:59:02,856 --> 00:59:04,887
I don't want to play.

561
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:07,989
How do you feel about Jon being king?

562
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:12,335
Is there someone else you think should
rule the North instead of him?

563
00:59:12,455 --> 00:59:15,538
Those faces, what are they?

564
00:59:16,033 --> 00:59:17,852
Is that what you should be asking?

565
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,125
Are you sure?

566
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:23,439
The game of faces didn't turn out so well
for the last person who asked me questions.

567
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,653
Tell me what they are!

568
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:32,110
We both wanted to be other people when
we were younger.

569
00:59:32,726 --> 00:59:34,545
You wanted to be a queen.

570
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:38,759
To sit next to a handsome young king
on the Iron Throne.

571
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,336
I wanted to be a knight

572
00:59:42,035 --> 00:59:45,036
To pick up a sword like
father and go off to battle.

573
00:59:47,037 --> 00:59:49,523
Neither of us got to be the other person,
did we?

574
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:53,967
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they are going to be.

575
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:59,242
But I can now.
With the faces I can choose.

576
01:00:00,283 --> 01:00:02,253
I can become someone else.

577
01:00:03,284 --> 01:00:07,498
Speak in their voice, live in their skin.

578
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:12,753
I can even become you.

579
01:00:19,295 --> 01:00:24,327
I wonder what it would feel like
to wear those pretty dresses.

580
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:28,747
To be the Lady of Winterfell.

581
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:33,252
All I'd need to find out

582
01:00:34,586 --> 01:00:37,072
is your face.

583
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,271
I'm sorry.

584
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:38,252
I'm so sorry.

585
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:51,016
I wish I could take it back.

586
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:55,291
I wish we'd never gone.

587
01:01:58,657 --> 01:01:59,658
I don't.

588
01:02:01,568 --> 01:02:03,842
If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen.

589
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,338
You have to see it to know.

590
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:11,036
Now I know.

591
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:15,948
The dragons are my children.

592
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:20,664
They're the only children I'll ever have.

593
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:30,193
We are going to destroy the Night King
and his army.

594
01:02:30,891 --> 01:02:32,831
And we'll do it together.

595
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:36,046
You have my word.

596
01:02:39,411 --> 01:02:40,776
Thank you, Dany.

597
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:43,756
Dany...

598
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:47,698
Who was the last person who called me that?

599
01:02:49,268 --> 01:02:51,663
I'm not sure, is it my brother?

600
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,937
Not the company you want to keep.

601
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:57,425
Alright.

602
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:00,608
Not Dany.

603
01:03:04,324 --> 01:03:06,143
How about "My Queen"?

604
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,842
I'd...

605
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:12,509
bend the knee but...

606
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,238
What about those who
swore allegiance to you?

607
01:03:15,702 --> 01:03:18,674
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

608
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:35,324
I hope I deserve it.

609
01:03:37,476 --> 01:03:38,689
You do.

610
01:03:59,024 --> 01:04:01,389
You should get some rest.

611
01:05:49,952 --> 01:06:00,684
