1
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:06,234
Clegane, look into the flames.

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:07,775
What do you see?

3
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:09,567
A wall of ice.

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:11,983
The Wall.

5
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:15,274
The only thing standing
between us

6
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,941
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

7
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:19,734
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,525
Last time we saw The Night King,

9
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:22,567
it was at Hardhome.

10
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:25,816
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,577
And that's where I'll go.

12
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:30,400
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

13
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:36,776
This suits you, Lady Stark.

14
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:40,192
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

15
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,234
- Lord Tarly.
- I believe you know my son.

16
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:54,900
Do you fight with us...

17
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,858
or with the foreign savages
and eunuchs?

18
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:01,233
What do you think I should do?

19
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,983
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

20
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:05,400
you're not different.

21
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,484
You're just more of the same.

22
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,651
Listen.

23
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:14,912

24
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,025
You could've killed me.

25
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,483
The fuck were you doing
back there?

26
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:01,775
Ending the war.

27
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,982
Killing her.

28
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:06,400
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

29
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:12,400
And?

30
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,982
Listen to me, cunt.

31
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:22,525
Till I get what I'm owed,

32
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,358
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

33
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,233
you don't get to kill you,

34
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:27,692
only I get to kill you.

35
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:33,691
That was only one of them.

36
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:36,525
She has two more.

37
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,608
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

38
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,233
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

39
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,233
No, I do not.

40
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:47,399
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

41
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,024
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

42
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,776
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

43
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,275
I have to tell Cersei.

44
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,067
May as well jump
back in that river.

45
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:16,399
I know what Cersei has told you.

46
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,149
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

47
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,399
burn down your homes,

48
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,150
murder you,
and orphan your children.

49
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:30,775
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

50
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:32,982
I'm not here to murder,

51
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,733
and all I want to destroy

52
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:37,816
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

53
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:42,025
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

54
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,483
I offer you a choice--

55
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,816
bend the knee and join me.

56
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:51,982
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

57
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:54,982
Or refuse...

58
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,484
and die.

59
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:27,025
Step forward, my lord.

60
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:38,149
You will not kneel?

61
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,526
I already have a queen.

62
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,233
My sister.

63
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,441
She wasn't your queen

64
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,483
until recently, though, was she?

65
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:47,816
When she murdered
your rightful queen

66
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,441
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

67
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:53,734
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

68
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,775
There are
no easy choices in war.

69
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,149
Say what you will
about your sister,

70
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,650
she was born in Westeros.

71
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,900
She's lived here all her life.

72
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,733
You, on the other hand,

73
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,483
murdered your own father

74
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:15,608
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

75
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:18,442
One with no ties to this land...

76
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,442
with an army of savages
at her back.

77
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:26,108
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

78
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,566
I respect that.

79
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,608
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

80
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:35,024
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

81
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,274
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

82
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,609
You cannot send me to the Wall.

83
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,609
You are not my queen.

84
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,399
You will have to kill me, too.

85
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,275
Step back and shut your mouth.

86
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,233
Who are you?

87
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:03,484
A stupid boy.

88
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,816
I am Dickon Tarly,

89
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:08,233
son of Randyll Tarly.

90
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:10,441
You are the future
of your house.

91
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,816
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

92
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,692
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

93
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,817
I will not.

94
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,857
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

95
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,441
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

96
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,107
I meant what I said.

97
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,650
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

98
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,982
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

99
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,359
I gave them a choice.

100
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,191
They made it.

101
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:48,358
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families--

102
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,526
I'm not beheading anyone.

103
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,359
Your Grace.

104
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:25,233
Lord Randyll
Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

105
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,899
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

106
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,024
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

107
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,858
sentence you to die.

108
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:37,609
Dracarys.

109
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,150
My-- my lord...

110
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,651
How many men did we lose?

111
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,275
We haven't done
a full accounting.

112
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:48,441
It's not only armies
that win wars.

113
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,941
We have the Tyrell gold, we
have the Iron Bank behind us.

114
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,609
We can buy mercenaries.

115
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,399
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

116
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,608
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

117
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:02,066
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

118
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,691
They'll beat any mercenary army.

119
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,775
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

120
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,650
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

121
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:10,857
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

122
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,107
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

123
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,651
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

124
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,608
This isn't a war we can win.

125
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:20,983
So, what do we do?

126
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,651
Sue for peace?

127
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,566
I sit on her father's throne,

128
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,233
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

129
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:32,066
And in her mind, she's winning.

130
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,150
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

131
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,024
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

132
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,400
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

133
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,650
He didn't.

134
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:47,650
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

135
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,525
I'm not talking about Father.

136
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:53,066
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

137
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,359
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you--
- It was Olenna.

138
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,067
She confessed before she died.

139
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,608
And this was before or after

140
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,691
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

141
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,316
After.

142
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:11,816
And you believed her?

143
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,566
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

144
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:17,234
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

145
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,982
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

146
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:23,525
Which one would have made Olenna

147
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:26,233
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

148
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,108
She was telling the truth.

149
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,692
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

150
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,274
She should have died screaming.

151
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,566
She's dead, like her son,

152
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,650
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

153
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:48,233
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

154
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,775
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

155
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,941
I know my choice.

156
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,442
A soldier should know his.

157
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,733
They're beautiful, aren't they?

158
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,526
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

159
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:11,525
but, yes, they are.

160
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,024
Gorgeous beasts.

161
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,941
They're not beasts to me.

162
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,775
No matter how big they get

163
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,941
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

164
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:20,567
they're my children.

165
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,566
You weren't gone long.

166
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,733
No.

167
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:31,733
And?

168
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:34,442
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

169
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,191
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

170
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,900
No, I'm not.

171
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:44,274
How many men did your army kill

172
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:46,275
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

173
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:48,816
Thousands.

174
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,941
We both want to help people.

175
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:54,650
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

176
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,734
Sometimes strength is terrible.

177
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,608
When you first came here,

178
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:06,358
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

179
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,983
Ser Davos gets carried away.

180
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,441
So, it was a figure of speech?

181
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:19,303
_

182
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:27,406
_

183
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,182
Your Grace.

184
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,399
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

185
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,650
an old friend.

186
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,149
I served with your father.

187
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,317
He was a great man.

188
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,526
You look strong.

189
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,691
You found a cure?

190
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,650
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

191
00:17:56,651 --> 00:18:01,149
I return to your
service, my queen,

192
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,941
if you'll have me.

193
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:05,317
It would be my honor.

194
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:46,233
Ravens.

195
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,067
We need to send ravens.

196
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:53,274
I put very little stock
in it myself.

197
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,733
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

198
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,941
especially when winter comes.

199
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:00,274
I remember Wolkan.

200
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,650
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

201
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:06,149
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

202
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,358
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

203
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,149
or the company.

204
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,316
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

205
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,441
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

206
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:17,608
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

207
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,274
Yes, it is a bit much.

208
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:21,983
- Still, we ought to write back--
- Brandon Stark.

209
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,651
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

210
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,982
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

211
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:35,149
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

212
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,733
And?

213
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,650
Somehow, a crippled boy

214
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,733
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

215
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:45,484
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

216
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,191
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

217
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:52,316
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

218
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,734
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

219
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,358
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

220
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:14,525
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

221
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:16,899
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

222
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,857
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

223
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:22,358
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

224
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,691
to search every word
of every faded scroll

225
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:26,483
about the Long Night,

226
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,316
they may find something
that lets us defeat

227
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,234
the Army of the Dead for good.

228
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,526
It could be done.

229
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:40,733
And this news
could be authentic.

230
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,400
It's possible.

231
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,233
It's also possible
that this message

232
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,525
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

233
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:52,483
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

234
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:54,525
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

235
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,233
That does seem far more likely

236
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:58,191
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

237
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,733
Archmaester, please.

238
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:01,900
It's real.

239
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:04,900
I've seen it.

240
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,233
We will write to Maester Wolkan

241
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:11,608
at Winterfell for clarification.

242
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,483
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

243
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:17,191
- Archmaester, please--
- That will be all, Tarly.

244
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,691
It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

245
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:22,316
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

246
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:25,107
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

247
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:28,775
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

248
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:31,067
Ah, Lodos.

249
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,899
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

250
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,857
I'm afraid so.

251
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,107
Horrible business.

252
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:44,733
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

253
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,775
He's a good lad.

254
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,525
Right.

255
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:51,441
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

256
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,274
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

257
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,484
That's why they're rulers.

258
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:05,608
She gave Tarly a choice,

259
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:08,441
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

260
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:10,191
What else could she do?

261
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:13,316
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

262
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,650
I am her Hand, not her head.

263
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:17,899
I can't make
her decisions for her.

264
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,191
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

265
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:25,566
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

266
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:28,317
I was only a purveyor
of information.

267
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:37,525
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy--

268
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,107
I'm not the one doing it.

269
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:42,566
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher--

270
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,608
I'm not the one doing it.

271
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,191
When their hair caught fire

272
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,066
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room--

273
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,692
I'm not the one doing it.

274
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,566
Daenerys is not her father.

275
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,982
And she never will be

276
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:06,025
with the right counsel.

277
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,692
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

278
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,525
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

279
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:19,066
Did you read it?

280
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:22,108
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

281
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,692
What's it say?

282
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:32,359
Nothing good.

283
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:42,233
I thought Arya was dead.

284
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:45,316
I thought Bran was dead.

285
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,734
I'm happy for you.

286
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:50,525
You don't look happy.

287
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:52,899
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

288
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
marching towards Eastwatch.

289
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,483
If they make it past the Wall...

290
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:01,191
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

291
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:02,857
I need to go home.

292
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:04,566
You said you don't
have enough men.

293
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:07,149
We'll fight
with the men we have.

294
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,775
Unless you'll join us.

295
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,941
And give the country to Cersei?

296
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,775
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

297
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:17,107
Perhaps not.

298
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:20,525
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

299
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:23,775
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

300
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:25,525
What if we prove her wrong?

301
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,942
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

302
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:32,275
So bring the dead to her.

303
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,608
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

304
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,982
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

305
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,024
Only one soldier.

306
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:41,942
Is that possible?

307
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:47,483
The first wight I ever saw

308
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:50,316
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

309
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:52,650
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

310
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,941
and show her the truth.

311
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:56,982
Anything you bring back
will be useless

312
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,816
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

313
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:01,358
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

314
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,608
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

315
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:07,191
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

316
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,025
He might listen to me.

317
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:14,858
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

318
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:22,857
I can smuggle you in,

319
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:25,483
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

320
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,691
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

321
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:30,107
Well, it will all be for nothing

322
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:31,899
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

323
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,274
Fair point.

324
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:34,567
How do you propose to find one?

325
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:41,192
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

326
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,233
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

327
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,858
Allow me to serve you.

328
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,358
The Free Folk will help us.

329
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,107
They know the real north
better than anyone.

330
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:57,650
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

331
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:58,858
They won't have to.

332
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,316
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

333
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:10,941
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

334
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:13,525
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

335
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,900
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

336
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:19,275
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

337
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,483
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

338
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:26,692
I am a king.

339
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:29,733
And I came here

340
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,566
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

341
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,775
or your dragons burn me alive.

342
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:39,191
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

343
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:42,191
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

344
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:44,359
for all our people.

345
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,234
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

346
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:54,442
because it's our best chance.

347
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:16,776
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

348
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:23,691
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

349
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:26,526
But perhaps we should have.

350
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:33,816
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

351
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:35,275
Aye.

352
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:43,149
You are very kind, my lords.

353
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,191
But Jon is our king.

354
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:47,733
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

355
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:59,691
I warned Jon this would happen.

356
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:01,358
That he couldn't leave the North

357
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,191
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

358
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,566
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

359
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,359
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

360
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:16,316
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

361
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:17,858
And?

362
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,899
Nothing.

363
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,691
Don't do that.

364
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:28,192
- What?
- Say what you mean.

365
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:32,317
You always liked nice things.

366
00:29:33,692 --> 00:29:36,025
They made you feel
better than everyone.

367
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:42,525
Are you angry with me?

368
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:44,857
They were insulting Jon,

369
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:46,233
and you sat there and listened.

370
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:47,733
I listened to their complaints,

371
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:50,775
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

372
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:53,733
Their opinions
are important to you.

373
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:56,441
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

374
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:59,399
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

375
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Not if they lose
their heads first.

376
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:08,024
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

377
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:09,899
We took it back,

378
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,857
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

379
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:13,316
and the wildlings and the Vale.

380
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:14,857
All of us, working together.

381
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:19,191
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

382
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,734
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

383
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,191
And if Jon doesn't come back,

384
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:30,149
you'll need their support...

385
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,274
so you can work together

386
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,233
to give you
what you really want.

387
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,817
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

388
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:41,567
You're thinking it right now.

389
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,525
You don't want to be,

390
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:48,817
but the thought
just won't go away.

391
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,609
I have work to do.

392
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,567
My lady.

393
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,857
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

394
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:19,817
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

395
00:31:22,983 --> 00:31:25,816
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

396
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,483
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

397
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,858
Too many steps.

398
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:36,024
You're not staying here?

399
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:39,525
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

400
00:31:39,526 --> 00:31:41,358
What if someone takes the boat?

401
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,651
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

402
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,483
We don't have time for this.

403
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:52,650
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

404
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:53,816
The Dothraki are coming.

405
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:55,941
All the more reason
for you to train.

406
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:57,941
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

407
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,483
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

408
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:02,483
And here I am, ready to train.

409
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:04,441
Why down here?

410
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:06,274
I don't think
you want people to see

411
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:09,191
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

412
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,982
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

413
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:14,526
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

414
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,400
I'll leave you to it.

415
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:29,526
I needed to see you.

416
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,817
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

417
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,316
You made me look
like a complete fool.

418
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,608
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

419
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:44,566
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

420
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:47,149
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

421
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,650
Father would have been proud.

422
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:50,399
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me--

423
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,899
I once told Bronn

424
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,734
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

425
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:00,234
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

426
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,316
He was going to execute me.

427
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:14,024
He knew I was innocent.

428
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,358
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

429
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,733
he hated me
because of what I am.

430
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:21,900
A little monster
sent to punish him.

431
00:33:23,776 --> 00:33:25,982
Did he--
did he think--

432
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:27,775
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

433
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:29,656
- Did he think I chose it--
- What do you want?!

434
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:37,734
Daenerys will win this war.

435
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,525
You're a military man.

436
00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:44,275
You must know there's
no way around that.

437
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:47,899
Daenerys is not her father.

438
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,775
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

439
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:53,275
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

440
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:55,816
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

441
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:57,274
you can ask her yourself.

442
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,651
I-- I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

443
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,776
Not right now, anyway.

444
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,192
She has a more
important request.

445
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:48,900
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

446
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:58,191
Thought you might
still be rowing.

447
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,899
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

448
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,191
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

449
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,691
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

450
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,107
Haven't been here in years.

451
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:14,525
Why should they recognize me?

452
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,192
Sometimes I hardly do.

453
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:21,025
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

454
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:27,899
Anybody give you any trouble?

455
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,358
Here I am, arming Lannisters,

456
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,233
and I never get a second look.

457
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:33,733
But you were right.

458
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:36,274
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

459
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:37,775
Don't be so sure.

460
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:40,692
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

461
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,442
Bad things are coming.

462
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:50,163
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

463
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,322
Well, the thing you need to
understand is--

464
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,012
I'm ready.

465
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:53,483
- You--
- Let's go.

466
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,399
You should know
what you're heading into.

467
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,399
What do you think
I've been thinking about

468
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,775
with every swing of the hammer?

469
00:35:58,776 --> 00:36:01,233
How happy I am making weapons

470
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,691
for the family
that killed my father?

471
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,399
The family that
tried to kill me?

472
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:09,775
I've been getting ready.

473
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:11,233
I never knew what for,

474
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:13,776
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

475
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:18,525
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

476
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:20,442
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

477
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:23,275
But this...

478
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:26,442
this I know.

479
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,941
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

480
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,734
Situation's complicated
enough already.

481
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:42,776
Well, who should I say I am?

482
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:49,024
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

483
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:50,865
- someone's going to--
- You there!

484
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,484
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

485
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,149
What can I do for you?

486
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,650
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

487
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,066
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

488
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,566
I try to stay away from them

489
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,817
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

490
00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:12,816
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

491
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:15,066
You must be even older
than you look.

492
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,982
- 15.
- 15?!

493
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,108
Apiece.

494
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:28,651
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

495
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,526
What's in the boat?

496
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,233
Not more gold.

497
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:40,982
- Wine?
- Mm.

498
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,983
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

499
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,025
Come have a look.

500
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:56,483
- Fermented crab.
- What?

501
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,358
Fermented crab.

502
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,358
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

503
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,316
A man thinks he's done.

504
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:05,899
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

505
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,816
But before he gets
his breeches up,

506
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:11,191
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

507
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:14,733
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

508
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:17,234
Here, have a taste.

509
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,775
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

510
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,274
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

511
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:03,275
Oi, dwarf!

512
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,149
I really wouldn't try any more

513
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,191
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

514
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,066
That dwarf...

515
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,691
Where'd you get that scar?

516
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:14,233
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

517
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:17,316
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

518
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:19,358
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

519
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,733
Arrangement?

520
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:26,941
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei--

521
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:36,483
This is Gendry.

522
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:37,983
He'll do.

523
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:41,692
Go, go, go.

524
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,982
I could give you something.

525
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,484
That won't be necessary.

526
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,150
Ser Jaime.

527
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,651
Why was Qyburn here?

528
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,317
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

529
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:13,526
I met with Tyrion.

530
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,150
What did our brother
have to say?

531
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,191
Daenerys wants to meet.

532
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:31,816
To discuss her surrender?

533
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:33,650
To discuss an armistice.

534
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:36,441
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

535
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:38,191
Because an army of dead men

536
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:40,734
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

537
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,066
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

538
00:40:48,942 --> 00:40:51,316
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

539
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:52,817
Bronn.

540
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,733
He betrayed you.

541
00:40:57,734 --> 00:41:00,108
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

542
00:41:03,942 --> 00:41:05,233
Do you think
anything of importance

543
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,733
happens in this city
without me knowing?

544
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:10,982
You let it happen.
Why?

545
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:13,650
I've come to believe that

546
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:16,358
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

547
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:18,899
could be in our
immediate interest.

548
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,233
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

549
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:24,400
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

550
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:31,025
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

551
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:36,066
Whatever stands in our way,

552
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:37,816
we will defeat it.

553
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:40,608
For ourselves, for our house,

554
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:42,609
for this.

555
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,816
Who will you say is the father?

556
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:58,108
You.

557
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:05,275
People won't like that.

558
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,316
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

559
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:17,275
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

560
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:33,150
Never betray me again.

561
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:40,149
We're leaving today.

562
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,733
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

563
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:46,316
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

564
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:48,775
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

565
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:51,107
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

566
00:42:51,108 --> 00:42:54,107
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

567
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:56,107
Understood.

568
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,733
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

569
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:01,191
You survived King's Landing.

570
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:04,191
Yet again. Your
Grace, this is Clo--

571
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:06,608
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

572
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,191
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

573
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:09,317
Bastard son.

574
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,857
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

575
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,691
Our fathers trusted each other.

576
00:43:16,692 --> 00:43:18,025
Why shouldn't we?

577
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:22,816
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

578
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:26,025
I met yours in my shop.

579
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:30,067
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

580
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,941
I grew up on stories about them.

581
00:43:43,942 --> 00:43:46,942
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

582
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,483
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

583
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:53,274
Let me come with you.

584
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:55,149
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

585
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,982
No, but I'm a fighter.

586
00:43:56,983 --> 00:44:00,067
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

587
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:03,982
You know how to use one?

588
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:06,358
Well, that's a problem.

589
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:07,900
I prefer a hammer.

590
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,609
He can handle himself.

591
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,483
We could use the help.

592
00:44:16,484 --> 00:44:18,358
As my father used to say,

593
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,441
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

594
00:44:20,442 --> 00:44:22,691
than dead for
the rest of your life."

595
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:25,107
I owe you my life.

596
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:26,899
Twice over.

597
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,149
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

598
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,609
I can't wait out this war.

599
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,316
Yeah, nobody mind me.

600
00:44:38,317 --> 00:44:42,358
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

601
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,274
All right, come on.

602
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,107
You may not believe it,

603
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:58,816
but I've missed you, Mormont.

604
00:44:58,817 --> 00:45:01,941
Nobody glowers quite like you.

605
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:03,234
Not even Grey Worm.

606
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:10,982
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

607
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,982
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

608
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:17,817
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

609
00:45:22,275 --> 00:45:23,651
Take it with you.

610
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:27,816
But bring it back.

611
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:28,983
Our queen needs you.

612
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,817
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

613
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:43,983
Your Grace, I...

614
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,650
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

615
00:46:03,651 --> 00:46:05,011
with the King
in the North anymore.

616
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:09,192
I've grown used to him.

617
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:13,900
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

618
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,651
Heave!

619
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:52,233
Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

620
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:53,441
No.

621
00:46:53,442 --> 00:46:56,400
15,782.

622
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:04,400
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

623
00:47:06,526 --> 00:47:09,066
None anymore.

624
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:10,733
That's true.

625
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:15,066
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

626
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:17,275
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

627
00:47:20,817 --> 00:47:24,024
What does "annulment" mean?

628
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:27,899
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

629
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,274
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

630
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:36,775
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

631
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:39,316
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

632
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,233
Is that a common thing
in the south or--?

633
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,609
These maesters...

634
00:47:44,484 --> 00:47:48,066
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

635
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:50,358
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

636
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:52,149
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

637
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,816
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

638
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:56,733
But that's all right, isn't it?

639
00:47:56,734 --> 00:48:00,816
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

640
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:02,441
as long as we can have access
to the full records

641
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:06,484
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

642
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:10,442
Steps.

643
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:15,609
That number was the steps.

644
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:40,149
Are you sure
you want to do this?

645
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,567
You always wanted
to be a maester.

646
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:48,359
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

647
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,317
I found it, my lord.

648
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:24,733
It, uh, took some searching.

649
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:26,817
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

650
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:34,149
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

651
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,025
Uh, yes, my lord.

652
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:42,734
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

653
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:16,733
Isn't it your
job to talk him out

654
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:18,733
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

655
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:21,526
I've been failing
at that job of late.

656
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,191
How many queens are there now?

657
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:26,525
Two.

658
00:54:26,526 --> 00:54:29,691
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

659
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:31,525
or the one who
fucks her brother?

660
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,359
Both.

661
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,400
How many men did you bring?

662
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,024
Not enough.

663
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,651
The big woman?

664
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:48,775
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

665
00:54:48,776 --> 00:54:51,608
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

666
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:54,733
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

667
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:55,734
You are.

668
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:01,734
You really want to go out there?
Again?

669
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:09,776
You're not the only ones.

670
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,899
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

671
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,776
Said they were
on their way here.

672
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:27,067
You're the Hound.

673
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,900
I saw you once at Winterfell.

674
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:38,775
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

675
00:55:38,776 --> 00:55:42,066
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

676
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:44,233
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming--

677
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:46,441
Don't trust him.

678
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,400
Don't trust any of them.

679
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:55,650
They're the Brotherhood.

680
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:58,233
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

681
00:55:58,234 --> 00:56:00,608
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

682
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:02,317
Thoros?

683
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,441
I hardly recognized you.

684
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:11,650
Ser Jorah Mormont.

685
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:14,608
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

686
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:17,650
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

687
00:56:17,651 --> 00:56:20,483
You're a fucking Mormont?

688
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:22,608
Like the last Lord Commander?

689
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:24,816
He was my father.

690
00:56:24,817 --> 00:56:27,816
He hunted us like animals.

691
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,857
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

692
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:35,149
Here we all are

693
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,733
at the edge of the world

694
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:38,316
at the same moment,

695
00:56:38,317 --> 00:56:40,817
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

696
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:44,899
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

697
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,275
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

698
00:56:49,484 --> 00:56:51,274
There's a greater
purpose at work.

699
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:54,566
And we serve it together,

700
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,857
whether we know it or not.

701
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:59,775
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light--

702
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:03,149
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

703
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,941
Are we coming with you or not?

704
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:08,149
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

705
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:12,566
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

706
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:14,566
He's right.

707
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,567
We're all on the same side.

708
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:20,192
How can we be?

709
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,900
We're all breathing.

710
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:44,844
