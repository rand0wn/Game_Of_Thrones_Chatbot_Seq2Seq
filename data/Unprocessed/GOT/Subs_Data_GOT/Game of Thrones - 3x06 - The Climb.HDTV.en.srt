1
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,945
You've got too much
wood in there.

2
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,615
But the more wood,
the bigger the fire.

3
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,751
It needs to breathe.

4
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,720
<i>Take off that big log.</i>

5
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:12,601
Huh.
You know your fires.

6
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,113
Someone built your fires
for you growing up?

7
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:27,016
It doesn't get so cold
down in the Reach.

8
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,886
And there were
servants, of course.

9
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:33,189
I knew you were highborn.

10
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:40,596
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

11
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,133
Buried treasure.

12
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,670
Thousands of years old.

13
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,304
I think.

14
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,408
What does it do?

15
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:56,144
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

16
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,380
It's beautiful, though,
isn't it?

17
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,658
- How much longer?
- Not so far.

18
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,860
A few more days.

19
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,231
Is the Wall
as big as they say?

20
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:17,133
Bigger.

21
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,371
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

22
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,407
It's hidden in clouds.

23
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:26,777
You're playing with me.

24
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:30,982
I'm not.
It's 700 feet high,

25
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:33,318
all made of ice.

26
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,021
On a warm day
you can see it weeping.

27
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:43,929
Castle Black
is nice enough.

28
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:47,299
They keep a fire burning
in the long hall

29
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,068
day and night.

30
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:53,239
And Hobb makes
venison stew

31
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,040
with onions.

32
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,475
Very tasty.

33
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,813
Sometimes, one of
the brothers will sing.

34
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,382
Dareon sings best.

35
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,517
- Do you sing?
- No.

36
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:08,353
No, no, no.
Not very well.

37
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,925
Sing me a song.

38
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,562
Oh, all right.

39
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:18,498
Let's see.

40
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:23,268
Oh... ahem.

49
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,208
That's not how
you skin a rabbit.

50
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:04,710
I know how
to skin a rabbit.

51
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:07,079
Not by the looks of it.

52
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,196
You grow up
north of the Wall,

53
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:27,065
you learn the proper
way to handle game.

54
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,534
I didn't see any game
before I got here.

55
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:33,138
If I had a bow, I could have shot
a dozen rabbits.

56
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,706
Well, I made
this bow myself.

57
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,841
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

58
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,009
You learn how to use
your fists, though.

59
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:41,078
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

60
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,580
I had someone else in mind.

61
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:44,081
Well, someone else
is sitting right here.

62
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:46,584
You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

63
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:49,453
Some of us are just
a little better.

64
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,455
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

65
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,557
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

66
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:55,526
Or don't they teach you to say
thank you north of the Wall?

67
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,196
You've got a big mouth, girl,
and too many teeth.

68
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,398
- Stop it!
- Hodor.

69
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:03,934
You've been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.

70
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,770
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

71
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,271
it's a wonder her feet
touch the ground.

72
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,641
You've been nasty
to her every day.

73
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,075
Of course she's nasty back.

74
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,710
Me? It's my fault?

75
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,912
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

76
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,281
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

77
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,152
We can't fight each other.

78
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:24,455
We'll never make it
to the Wall.

79
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,224
I want you both
to make peace.

80
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:38,403
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

81
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:41,039
- I said so, didn't I?
- Osha!

82
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,210
You're a good
little hunter.

83
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:47,678
Thank you.

84
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,146
See?

85
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,914
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

86
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,349
Don't push me.

87
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:04,761
Shh.

88
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,830
I'm right here with you.

89
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:08,798
What's happening?

90
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,001
I'm right here with you.

91
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,903
What's wrong with him?

92
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,109
The visions
take their toll.

93
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,446
He's having one now?

94
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,634
I saw Jon Snow.

95
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,637
You saw him?

96
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,238
At Castle Black?

97
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,941
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

98
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:56,577
surrounded by enemies.

99
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:09,757
Used to be you couldn't
find a tree within a mile of the Wall.

100
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,927
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

101
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:19,666
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

102
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,775
You ever climbed it before?

103
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,878
No.

104
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:32,848
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

105
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,657
You're afraid.

106
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>- Aren't you?
- Aye.</i>

107
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:47,664
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

108
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,067
But I've waited
my whole life

109
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,102
to see the world
from up there.

110
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,610
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

111
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,914
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

112
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,783
You kill someone
for them?

113
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:07,985
Nah.

114
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,787
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

115
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:12,189
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

116
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:21,833
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

117
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:26,471
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

118
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,274
Can we not talk
about that here?

119
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,777
"Can we not talk
about that here?

120
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:33,612
I'm Jon Snow.

121
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,648
I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

122
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:37,784
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

123
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:39,319
Did I seem scared
the other day?

124
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:40,987
You were trembling
like a leaf.

125
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,555
Only in the beginning.

126
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:45,959
Only in the beginning.

127
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,098
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

128
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:54,001
And don't worry.

129
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:56,103
Your secret's safe
with me.

130
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:58,572
What secret?

131
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:02,075
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

132
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,045
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

133
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,015
You're loyal
and you're brave.

134
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,887
You didn't stop
being a crow

135
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:17,623
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

136
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:26,666
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

137
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:32,172
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

138
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:39,847
The Night's Watch
don't care if you live or die.

139
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:43,250
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

140
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,852
We're just soldiers
in their armies

141
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:47,188
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

142
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,399
It's you and me

143
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:00,502
that matters
to me and you.

144
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,474
Don't ever betray me.

145
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,283
I won't.

146
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:18,386
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

147
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,722
and wear it
'round my neck.

148
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,300
Sink your metal deep

149
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,870
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

150
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,406
And if you fall,

151
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,175
don't scream.

152
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,846
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

153
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:00,128
<i>Joffrey.</i>

154
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,134
Cersei.

155
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,036
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

156
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:11,172
You're good.

157
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:18,513
You're not as good
as you think you are.

158
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,850
Face, tits, balls--

159
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:24,452
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

160
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:28,222
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

161
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:31,759
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

162
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:36,029
Show me your position.

163
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,600
Keep your elbow high.

164
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:43,603
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

165
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,539
You're holding.

166
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:49,308
Never hold.

167
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:52,277
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

168
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:54,579
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

169
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,080
and release.

170
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:58,015
Never hold.

171
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,084
But I have to aim.

172
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,786
Never aim.

173
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,387
Never aim?

174
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:07,158
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

175
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,393
Trust your eye.

176
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:15,599
There's someone out there.

177
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,653
That's about far enough.

178
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:42,792
We come as friends.

179
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:44,627
<i>Begging
your pardon, m'lady,</i>

180
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,762
but we'll be
the judge of that.

181
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,732
Valar morghulis.

182
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,801
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

183
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,607
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

184
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,377
<i>Why are you here,
my lady?</i>

185
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,092
Forgive my manners.

186
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:53,128
I don't see many ladies
these days.

187
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:55,030
Lucky for the ladies.

188
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,594
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

189
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,463
Six.

190
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:56,359
I've always been
a terrible priest.

191
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,263
Drank too much rum.

192
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,398
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

193
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:05,134
It's a terrible
thing to say,

194
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:09,070
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.

195
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,575
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

196
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,146
<i>were stories we told
the children to make them behave.</i>

197
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,918
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

198
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:26,021
but it was just for show.

199
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,760
A spectacle
for the locals.

200
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:34,230
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

201
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:41,772
I knelt beside
his cold body

202
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:43,607
and said the old words.

203
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:46,343
Not because I believed
in them, but...

204
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:51,616
he was my friend

205
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,952
and he was dead.

206
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:57,089
And they were
the only words I knew.

207
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:01,626
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

208
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:05,963
Beric's eyes opened

209
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:08,732
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

210
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,769
Our god
is the one true god.

211
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,506
And all men
must serve Him.

212
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,584
You've been
to the other side.

213
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:29,587
The other side?

214
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,491
There is no other side.

215
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:37,194
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

216
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,002
He sent you to us
for a reason.

217
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,806
You have someone
He needs.

218
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:51,677
Bodkin point.

219
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:54,614
Penetrates plate
at 200 yards.

220
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,487
Can you make 'em?

221
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,889
Yeah, nothing tricky
about it.

222
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:05,225
Just need decent steel.

223
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:06,559
I'll get you the steel.

224
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,829
<i>Come on.</i>

225
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,099
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

226
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,971
That's 'cause
you're a girl.

227
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,739
What does that have
to do with anything?

228
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,613
Forgive me, lad.

229
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:33,486
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

230
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,155
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

231
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,989
He wants to be one of you.

232
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,291
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

233
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:41,493
We serve
the Lord of Light

234
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,729
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

235
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:46,365
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

236
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:55,474
You're not doing this
for your god.

237
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:57,176
You're doing it for gold.

238
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,378
We're doing it
for both, girl.

239
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:02,582
We can't defend the people
without weapons

240
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:04,884
and horses and food.

241
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,589
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

242
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:11,558
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

243
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:14,061
You told me
I could be one of you.

244
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:22,704
You are more
than they can ever be.

245
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:25,606
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

246
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:28,276
You will make kings
rise and fall.

247
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:43,224
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

248
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:50,498
I see a darkness in you.

249
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:54,969
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

250
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:57,005
brown eyes,

251
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,309
blue eyes,
green eyes.

252
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:03,512
Eyes you'll shut forever.

253
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,052
We will meet again.

254
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,999
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

255
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,777
You all right?

256
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:44,749
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

257
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:01,466
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

258
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,568
Wa--

259
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:08,640
Wa--? Wa--?

260
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:11,577
Water?

261
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:13,646
You want some water.

262
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,718
I wish I had
some for you.

263
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:35,102
So let's play a game.

264
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:39,507
Which body part
do you need the least?

265
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,579
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

266
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:46,915
I'll tell you everything,
please.

267
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:51,486
But you've already
told me everything.

268
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:54,022
<i>Remember?</i>

269
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:56,492
Your daddy
was mean to you.

270
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,862
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

271
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,499
One good bit, though.

272
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,734
The Stark boys,

273
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:08,470
they're still alive.

274
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:13,607
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

275
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:17,578
You failed, but I'm a better
hunter than you.

276
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,315
<i>Now...</i>

277
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:23,317
how about
your little finger?

278
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:25,186
You don't use that
for much, do you?

279
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,389
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

280
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:41,102
You've been wondering
why you're here.

281
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:43,638
<i>Haven't you?</i>

282
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,506
<i>Where you are.</i>

283
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,308
Who I am.

284
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:50,144
Why I'm doing
this to you.

285
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:53,982
So guess.

286
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,251
<i>If you guess right,</i>

287
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:57,852
I'll tell you.

288
00:25:57,887 --> 00:26:00,855
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

289
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,292
You win the game

290
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:06,394
if you can
figure out who I am

291
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:07,962
and why
I'm torturing you

292
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:11,332
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

293
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:17,005
If I win,
you'll let me go?

294
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,809
If you think this has
a happy ending,

295
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:24,845
you haven't been
paying attention.

296
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,513
Please.

297
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:30,484
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

298
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:36,089
You first.

299
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:38,224
Where are we?

300
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,828
- The North.
- Too vague.

301
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:43,496
Deepwood Motte.

302
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,967
Terrible guess.

303
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,178
Now, where?

304
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:01,182
Last Hearth.

305
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:04,285
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

306
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,490
Karhold!

307
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:18,031
Karhold?

308
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:22,769
How did you know that?

309
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:27,208
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

310
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:28,842
No.

311
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:31,445
It was just a guess.

312
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,983
Very good, Lord Theon.

313
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,920
And who am I?

314
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,123
Torrhen Karstark.

315
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:44,059
He's dead.

316
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:46,695
Strangled by
the Kingslayer.

317
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:51,032
He was your brother.

318
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,807
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

319
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:11,584
- You swore to tell me if I--
- You're right.

320
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,256
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

321
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,224
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

322
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:22,861
That's why you're
torturing me.

323
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:26,832
Yes.

324
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:32,004
You win.

325
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:46,051
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

326
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:49,588
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

327
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:57,997
I'm afraid I am.

328
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:03,202
Everything I told you
is a lie.

329
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:08,709
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

330
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:12,479
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

331
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:15,750
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

332
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,491
I win.

333
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:26,194
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

334
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:28,729
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

335
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:31,499
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

336
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:35,003
But when the King
of the North summons us, we come.

337
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:37,438
<i>Our father has
instructed us to tell you</i>

338
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:40,208
that his alliance
with the North can continue

339
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:42,911
if his terms are met.

340
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:45,880
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

341
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:47,916
for your violation
of your sacred oath

342
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,284
to marry one
of his daughters.

343
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:52,420
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

344
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:54,889
As restitution
for this betrayal,

345
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:58,026
<i>he demands Harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.</i>

346
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,395
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

347
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:04,398
Harrenhal is not
in the North.

348
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:08,102
It is his
once the war is over

349
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:10,771
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

350
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:14,607
And there's
something else.

351
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:17,443
We will do whatever we can
to give Lord Frey what he needs.

352
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:21,047
Not what, whom.

353
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:24,451
What?

354
00:30:28,356 --> 00:30:31,425
No.

355
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,694
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

356
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,663
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

357
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:37,532
How old is she?

358
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:38,800
19.

359
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,401
Could I see her first?

360
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:41,569
You want to count
her teeth?

361
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:44,338
<i>We depart for the Twins
in the morning.</i>

362
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,407
<i>We need an answer
before we leave</i>

363
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,141
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

364
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,210
or this alliance
is at an end.

365
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:52,813
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

366
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:55,515
Father is old.

367
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,550
It will put
his heart at peace

368
00:30:57,584 --> 00:31:00,452
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

369
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:03,322
And his recent experience
has made him wary

370
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,258
<i>of long engagements.</i>

371
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,093
He has every right to be.

372
00:31:07,127 --> 00:31:10,429
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

373
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:30,550
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

374
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:33,654
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

375
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:35,122
I'm his liege lord.

376
00:31:35,156 --> 00:31:37,357
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

377
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:39,359
I didn't wound him.

378
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,028
My answer is no.

379
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,000
Listen to me

380
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:50,004
and listen very carefully.
You--

381
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,740
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

382
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:55,242
No man can compel
another man to marry.

383
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:57,845
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

384
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:01,081
It's all right.
You heard him.

385
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:04,318
If you refuse, our alliance with
the Freys is dead.

386
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,754
He's wanted me for one
of his daughters since I was 12.

387
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:10,557
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

388
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:12,960
When I say no,
he will come back

389
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:14,995
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

390
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,864
You're willing to risk
our freedom

391
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:19,333
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

392
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,702
I have a war to fight.

393
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,737
We can't win it
without them.

394
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:25,606
I have no time to haggle.

395
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,775
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

396
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:31,713
You recall that
heroic engagement?

397
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:38,654
I had something
less permanent in mind.

398
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,123
I've won every battle,

399
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:42,992
but I'm losing this war.

400
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,997
If we don't do this
and do it now,

401
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:50,099
we're lost.

402
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,373
I'll marry her.

403
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,309
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

404
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:03,179
It's not fair or right.

405
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:05,014
I'll remember it.

406
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:12,655
<i>I see my men have
finally found you</i>

407
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,757
<i>something appropriate
to wear.</i>

408
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:18,694
Yes. Most kind of them.

409
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:20,795
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

410
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,465
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

411
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:25,500
<i>to return Jaime Lannister
to King's Landing.</i>

412
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:29,136
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

413
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:30,771
If she wasn't his mother,

414
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,906
<i>he'd have hanged her
for treason.</i>

415
00:33:40,114 --> 00:33:42,381
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

416
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:44,650
You should.

417
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:47,119
But instead,
you're sitting here

418
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:49,789
watching me fail at dinner.

419
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:51,991
Why might that be?

420
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:53,893
Wars cost money.

421
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,895
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

422
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:58,598
We both know
who would pay the most.

423
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:01,701
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

424
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,402
if he found out
you had captured me

425
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,671
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

426
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:08,074
You're right.

427
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:11,911
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

428
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:13,880
It would be,

429
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:17,217
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

430
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:19,919
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

431
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:22,288
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

432
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:24,491
He'll make time for you.

433
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,329
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

434
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:32,166
<i>I will allow you
to go to King's Landing</i>

435
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,703
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

436
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:39,106
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

437
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,676
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

438
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,118
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

439
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:56,658
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

440
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,128
Very well.

441
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:02,197
My lady,

442
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:05,300
may our journey continue
without further incident.

443
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:07,068
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

444
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:09,804
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

445
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,606
<i>You are charged
with abetting treason.</i>

446
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:14,775
I'm afraid I must insist.

447
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,477
<i>You're in no place
to insist on anything.</i>

448
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,646
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

449
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,516
about overplaying
your position.

450
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:29,656
<i>- Impossible.
- Why?</i>

451
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,025
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

452
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:35,195
<i>The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.</i>

453
00:35:35,229 --> 00:35:37,831
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

454
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:41,601
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

455
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:44,637
and the mother
of the king.

456
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,072
Old.

457
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:47,941
Old?

458
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:51,044
Old.

459
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:53,546
<i>I'm something of an expert
on the subject.</i>

460
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,182
<i>Her change will be
upon her before long.</i>

461
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:59,719
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

462
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:02,455
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

463
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,891
but this is another
matter entirely.

464
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:08,561
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

465
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:14,968
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

466
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,837
The only thing
that might turn it

467
00:36:16,871 --> 00:36:20,574
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

468
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,810
<i>- Do you deny them?
- Oh, not at all.</i>

469
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:25,879
A sword swallower
through and through.

470
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:27,680
And a boy
with his affliction

471
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:29,716
should be grateful
for the opportunity

472
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,785
<i>to marry the most beautiful
woman in the kingdoms</i>

473
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:34,686
and remove the stain
from his name.

474
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:37,956
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

475
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,991
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

476
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,860
squires, stable boys?

477
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:44,195
Of course.

478
00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:47,398
And you never...

479
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,467
No.

480
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,502
Not once?

481
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:53,104
Not in any way?

482
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,006
Never.

483
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,976
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

484
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:00,278
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

485
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:01,946
at each other
beneath the sheets.

486
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,549
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

487
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,484
for unnatural behavior.

488
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,952
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

489
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,255
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

490
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,458
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

491
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,229
brothers and sisters--

492
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,799
where I come from,
that stain

493
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,302
would be very difficult
to wash out.

494
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:25,938
I will not breathe
further life

495
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:28,374
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

496
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,011
Lie or not,

497
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:35,181
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

498
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:37,751
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

499
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:39,819
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

500
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:42,889
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

501
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:44,991
I don't care
what people believe.

502
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:47,860
And neither do you.

503
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:51,464
As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.

504
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:55,669
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

505
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:58,605
then Joffrey
is no king at all

506
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,809
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

507
00:38:02,844 --> 00:38:06,547
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

508
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:10,751
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

509
00:38:10,786 --> 00:38:14,322
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

510
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,891
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

511
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:20,128
All right.

512
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:22,696
I'll remove it for you.

513
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:25,532
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

514
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:28,435
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

515
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:31,904
<i>I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

516
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:33,939
He will never marry.

517
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:35,774
- He will never have children.
- Oh...

518
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,709
<i>The Tyrell name
will fade.</i>

519
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:40,412
And Highgarden will go
to the children

520
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:41,947
of Joffrey
and Margaery.

521
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,450
You would have
your grandson protected

522
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,319
by someone
who disgusts you?

523
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:49,956
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

524
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,327
who takes his vows
seriously.

525
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:56,196
So, shall I draw up
the order?

526
00:38:57,732 --> 00:39:00,134
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

527
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,839
It's a rare enough thing--

528
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:10,777
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

529
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:04,962
No!

530
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,351
We've gotta cut them loose!

531
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,653
No!

532
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:15,901
Take my hand!

533
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:53,841
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

534
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,378
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

535
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:04,085
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

536
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:12,793
I'm very happy about...

537
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,628
Uh, yes.

538
00:42:14,663 --> 00:42:16,830
I-I am as well.

539
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:21,168
I feel like
I'm in a dream.

540
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:24,973
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

541
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,542
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

542
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:28,777
The guests,

543
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:31,980
the food,
the tournaments.

544
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,587
And the bride,
of course.

545
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,027
The most beautiful bride
in the world

546
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,661
in a beautiful
gown of gold

547
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,264
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

548
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,936
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

549
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,705
No. I had never
left Winterfell

550
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,742
before I came
to King's Landing.

551
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,343
But it sounds wonderful.

552
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,979
I can't wait to see it.

553
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,115
And to leave this place.

554
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,985
It's terrible,
isn't it?

555
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,990
The most terrible
place there is.

556
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:25,736
<i>I don't suppose
there's anything we can do about this.</i>

557
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,038
We can have them
both killed.

558
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,808
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

559
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,845
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

560
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,813
Probably Sansa.

561
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:38,682
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

562
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,485
a deep and singular misery.

563
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,255
Father doesn't
discriminate.

564
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,125
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

565
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,260
On a boat you built.

566
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,331
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

567
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:54,901
I did what I did
to protect our family.

568
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:57,036
I'm your family.

569
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,006
A member of your family

570
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,076
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

571
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:05,911
Whether or not
you or Father

572
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:07,947
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

573
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:10,283
I do admit it.

574
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:12,952
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

575
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:16,289
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

576
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:19,392
<i>Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.</i>

577
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:23,763
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

578
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,968
There are two people
in King's Landing

579
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:30,169
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

580
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:33,173
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

581
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:36,109
<i>to kill me during the Battle
of the Blackwater?</i>

582
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:48,120
The impulse I understand.

583
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:52,258
He hates me
because I'm the only one

584
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:55,161
who tells him
what he really is.

585
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:02,468
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

586
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:04,504
But his stupidity?

587
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,541
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

588
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:12,044
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

589
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,247
to murder
the Hand of the King

590
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:16,182
in full view
of his own army.

591
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,750
The boy's an idiot.

592
00:45:17,785 --> 00:45:19,185
What do you
want me to say?

593
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:22,221
I want you to tell me if my life
is still in danger.

594
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:23,990
Probably.

595
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,725
But not from Joffrey.

596
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,927
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

597
00:45:29,597 --> 00:45:32,199
Seven kingdoms
united in fear

598
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,367
of Tywin Lannister.

599
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:36,770
Not the Tyrells.

600
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:38,839
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

601
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:40,307
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

602
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,242
the little
doe-eyed whore.

603
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:45,278
And so will his children
and their children.

604
00:45:45,313 --> 00:45:47,548
History will be taken
from our hands.

605
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:52,119
You may escape,
at least.

606
00:45:52,153 --> 00:45:53,787
Once Jaime gets back,

607
00:45:53,822 --> 00:45:56,323
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

608
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:59,560
of sword through bowels.

609
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,562
When Jaime gets back, yes.

610
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:03,264
But when do we think
that's going to be?

611
00:46:03,298 --> 00:46:05,132
He's out there somewhere.

612
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:10,805
Jaime or not,
I'm truly fucked.

613
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:16,011
Who's going to tell her?

614
00:46:17,413 --> 00:46:19,747
Do you think
people will like it?

615
00:46:19,782 --> 00:46:22,283
I don't think they
will even notice it.

616
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:24,786
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

617
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:27,756
Anyway, from what
I can tell,

618
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,958
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

619
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:31,559
to the ones
in King's Landing.

620
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:34,929
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

621
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:38,833
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

622
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:40,735
I'm sure he does.

623
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:44,138
Will they let me
invite my family?

624
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:46,574
They haven't asked
my opinion.

625
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:48,977
But do you think
they will?

626
00:46:49,011 --> 00:46:50,612
No.

627
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:59,253
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

628
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:02,123
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.

629
00:47:02,158 --> 00:47:04,526
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

630
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:07,096
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

631
00:47:08,565 --> 00:47:13,035
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

632
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:15,471
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

633
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:17,006
Of course.

634
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,709
Alone, if I may.

635
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:21,444
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

636
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:23,280
Shae.

637
00:47:23,314 --> 00:47:25,081
Please excuse her,
Lord Tyrion.

638
00:47:25,116 --> 00:47:26,617
<i>She's not from here.</i>

639
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:27,851
But I trust her,

640
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:30,154
even though
she tells me not to.

641
00:47:31,823 --> 00:47:35,660
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

642
00:47:35,694 --> 00:47:38,763
<i>and it's only afterwards
when it's too late</i>

643
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:41,565
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

644
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,734
under entirely
different circumstances.

645
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:45,603
It's all right, really.

646
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,375
How to begin?

647
00:47:53,945 --> 00:47:56,513
It's-- this--

648
00:47:56,548 --> 00:48:00,184
this-- this is awkward.

649
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,254
1,000 blades

650
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:07,357
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

651
00:48:07,392 --> 00:48:10,794
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

652
00:48:10,828 --> 00:48:13,564
There aren't
1,000 blades.

653
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:16,166
There aren't even 200.

654
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:17,702
I've counted.

655
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:20,371
Ha, I'm sure you have.

656
00:48:20,405 --> 00:48:23,141
Ugly old thing.

657
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:26,277
Yet it has
a certain appeal.

658
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:28,747
The Lysa Arryn
of chairs.

659
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,549
<i>Shame you had to settle
for your second choice.</i>

660
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:33,852
Early days, my friend.

661
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:36,821
It is flattering,
really...

662
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,792
you feeling such dread

663
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:43,294
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

664
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:46,131
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

665
00:48:46,165 --> 00:48:47,999
I promise you.

666
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:51,436
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

667
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,737
You're so right.

668
00:48:52,772 --> 00:48:54,573
For instance,

669
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:56,308
when I thwarted
your plan

670
00:48:56,342 --> 00:48:58,410
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

671
00:48:58,444 --> 00:49:00,545
If I'm going
to be honest,

672
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,447
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

673
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,950
of enjoyment there.

674
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,586
But your confidant,

675
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:12,090
the one who fed you information
about my plans,

676
00:49:12,124 --> 00:49:14,859
the one you swore
to protect...

677
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:18,796
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

678
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:23,434
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

679
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:26,671
She was a bad
investment on my part.

680
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:31,509
Luckily, I have a friend

681
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:33,911
who wanted to try
something new.

682
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:37,448
Something daring.

683
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:41,285
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

684
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,588
this fresh experience.

685
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:51,461
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

686
00:49:51,495 --> 00:49:54,130
The realm?

687
00:49:54,164 --> 00:49:56,565
Do you know
what the realm is?

688
00:49:58,335 --> 00:50:01,537
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

689
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:06,509
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

690
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:09,011
till we forget
that it's a lie.

691
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:13,616
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

692
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,585
Chaos.

693
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:18,321
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

694
00:50:18,355 --> 00:50:21,891
Chaos isn't a pit.

695
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:24,293
Chaos is a ladder.

696
00:50:26,463 --> 00:50:28,964
<i>Many who try
to climb it fail</i>

697
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:31,433
<i>and never get
to try again.</i>

698
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:35,103
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

699
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:47,248
<i>And some are given
a chance to climb,</i>

700
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:49,750
<i>but they refuse.</i>

701
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:53,120
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

702
00:50:53,154 --> 00:50:55,155
<i>or the gods</i>

703
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:57,624
<i>or love.</i>

704
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,893
<i>Illusions.</i>

705
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:03,863
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

706
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:07,200
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
