1
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,228
Burn them all!

2
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,797
Where's my sister?

3
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:53,568
Burn them all!

4
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,432
Please.

5
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,934
Burn them. Burn them all!

6
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,317
Burn them all!

7
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,395
Meera.

8
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,464
They found us.

9
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,640
I'm so sorry.

10
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,240
Come with me, now.

11
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,580
The dead don't rest.

12
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,107
It's so green.

13
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,876
Oh, yes.

14
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:04,778
Once you get south of the Riverlands,

15
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,781
very different sorts of
trees start to take over.

16
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:11,585
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

17
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,057
The odd willow.

18
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,626
And of course now that summer's over,

19
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,529
you'll start seeing the
autumn colors coming in.

20
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,035
Still, you'll find more green
here than anywhere else.

21
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:32,806
You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.

22
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:40,013
That's not any better
being a nervous mute.

23
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,583
I didn't think I'd ever come back here

24
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:47,021
after my father made
me renounce my title and inheritance

25
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,456
and, well, threaten to
kill me if I didn't.

26
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,393
A person just doesn't feel
welcome at that point.

27
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:58,699
And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.

28
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:02,636
So you know what to tell them.

29
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:04,605
That Little Sam is your baby.

30
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,273
Yes, now that's very important.

31
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:10,484
If he thinks that Little
Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in.

32
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:14,348
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

33
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,351
And you can help teach him. Huh?

34
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,387
What did you tell your family about me?

35
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:26,260
I told them I met you in the North.

36
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,228
Did you tell them how far north?

37
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,431
Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.

38
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,199
You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

39
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,101
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

40
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,304
The thing is...

41
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,740
my father doesn't like wildlings.

42
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:44,210
He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

43
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:47,881
so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

44
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,119
I... think we're here.

45
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:23,883
Sam.

46
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,219
Oh, Sam.

47
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,455
Oh, hello, Mother.

48
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,126
I never thought I'd see you again.

49
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,829
You look wonderful.

50
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,066
Talla?

51
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,936
Gods, you're a woman now.

52
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,505
Father says I have to
marry Symun Fossoway.

53
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,642
- He has yellow teeth...
- That's enough, Talla.

54
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:55,014
Oh... Mother, this is Gilly.

55
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,553
Oh, my.

56
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,755
You are lovely.

57
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,259
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

58
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,432
Oh, and this,

59
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,934
this is our son Samwell.

60
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,976
Hello, little one.

61
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:26,446
It's me, your grandmother.

62
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:29,649
May I hold him?

63
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,651
Yes, of course.

64
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,093
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

65
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,463
You'll be a scholar like your father.

66
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,655
Where is Father?

67
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:47,702
And Dickon?

68
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,536
They're on a hunt.

69
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,773
They'll join us for dinner.

70
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,209
Come inside. Such a journey.

71
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,011
You must be exhausted.

72
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:01,481
Come, you'll be wanting a
bath after all that travel.

73
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,683
Oh, and a dress for dinner.

74
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,452
You can wear one of mine.

75
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:07,387
What's... what's your color?

76
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:09,856
Midnight blue or silver?

77
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,058
Silver, maybe. Come.

78
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,528
You can choose one of my
bedrooms if you want.

79
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,072
Is there no other way?

80
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:27,741
You're afraid for her?

81
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,610
Of course I'm afraid for her!

82
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,783
It just seems very dangerous.

83
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:39,319
She'll be protected the entire way.

84
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,988
The Faith Militant are very stern

85
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,691
with those who overstep their bounds.

86
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:50,096
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

87
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:53,132
I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people

88
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:55,769
to gentleness on her behalf.

89
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,338
She's truly opened her heart to them.

90
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,208
She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.

91
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,144
And now she's devoted
to the gods as well.

92
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,583
Would you like to see her?

93
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,672
Have they hurt you?

94
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,173
Have they mistreated you?

95
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:37,343
- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.

96
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:39,145
More than you could know.

97
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:41,414
We'll be together again soon

98
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,250
and everything will be
better than it was before.

99
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,285
Better how?

100
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:47,754
Soon the...

101
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,025
walk of atonement.

102
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,662
He says there's no other way.

103
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:58,865
Have you spoken to him at
all, the High Sparrow?

104
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:02,335
Yes, a few times.

105
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,770
Have you?

106
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,371
Yes, I have.

107
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,141
He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?

108
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:12,412
You think I'm mad.

109
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,581
I sound mad.

110
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,616
No. No, you don't.

111
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,752
You... you could never.

112
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:20,520
You're right, he's not.

113
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,321
He's a lot more...

114
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:23,957
He is.

115
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,159
There's something about him.

116
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,327
His way of looking at the world.

117
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,869
It's not an easy thing admitting
to yourself what you really are.

118
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,904
It's taken me a while.

119
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,040
He's helped me.

120
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,042
What are you talking about?

121
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:46,479
You're a good person. You've
always been a good person.

122
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,749
You're the best person I know.

123
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:52,852
I was just telling him about
your devotion to the poor.

124
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,754
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

125
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:58,257
and I fed them soup and I made
sure I was seen doing it.

126
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,063
I never gave them what they
really needed, though.

127
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:07,834
I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.

128
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:12,038
All those stories I told
myself about who I was

129
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,774
and why I did the things I did.

130
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,678
There were so many
lies in those stories.

131
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:22,181
I don't understand.

132
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,450
It's all right. It really is.

133
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:28,021
It's such a relief to
let go of those lies.

134
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,961
What about Loras?

135
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,498
I love my brother.

136
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,435
I will always love my brother.

137
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:46,840
His soul is pure and perfect.

138
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,442
His sins don't erase that purity,

139
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:51,577
they only obscure it.

140
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,082
He just needs... to atone for them.

141
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:58,618
We all do.

142
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,921
Sooner or later, one way or another.

143
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:06,292
The gods have a plan for us all.

144
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,477
It's hard to walk in this.

145
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,581
It's beautiful.

146
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:32,251
You're beautiful.

147
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:23,336
This venison, it's very tasty.

148
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,972
Is it from today's hunt?

149
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,974
Well, no.

150
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:30,009
We haven't been able
to cure that one yet.

151
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,011
This is last week's.

152
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:35,648
Oh, of course. Sorry.

153
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,717
Long journey.

154
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,319
Brought it down from 70 yards.

155
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,021
One shot.

156
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:45,558
Oh, that's... that's a fair distance.

157
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,527
So do you do much
hunting up at the Wall?

158
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,297
Oh, yes. Yes.

159
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,966
A good amount.

160
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,701
North of the Wall,

161
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,937
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

162
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,474
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

163
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,178
Rabbits.

164
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,546
Sometimes squirrels.

165
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:14,553
I say "we," it's my friend Jon mostly.

166
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,455
Sometimes Edd.

167
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:18,224
Oh, and Gilly.

168
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:21,294
She's... she's quite a
good hunter as well.

169
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,630
Huntress.

170
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:26,933
I imagine it's common where you're from.

171
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:30,469
We once met a man, Lord Umber from
Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

172
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,806
who said he taught all his
daughters how to hunt.

173
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,408
Your father taught you to hunt?

174
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,343
Our father would never teach us.

175
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:41,447
I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.

176
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,849
That's enough of that.

177
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,887
Samwell, would you care for more bread?

178
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:50,957
Oh, yes. Yes, please.

179
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,625
Thank you, Mother.

180
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,865
Not fat enough already?

181
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,646
I travelled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

182
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,982
- He wants me to...
- I read your letter.

183
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,785
You're to be a maester.

184
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,221
Yes.

185
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:23,089
And once I have my chain,

186
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,691
I'll return to Castle Black.

187
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:28,995
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

188
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,798
Something resembling a man at least.

189
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:37,737
You managed to stay soft and fat.

190
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,242
Your nose buried in books.

191
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:46,779
Spending your life reading about
the achievements of better men.

192
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:50,350
I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

193
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:53,552
Randyll, to be maester of the
Night's Watch is a great honor.

194
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:55,989
He can wield a sword.

195
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,425
He killed a Thenn.

196
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:02,661
He killed a white walker.

197
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,665
There's no such thing.

198
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:11,304
I saw it with my own eyes on
our way down to Castle Black.

199
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:15,041
He drove a dagger into
the walker's heart.

200
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:18,644
He risked his own life to
save mine more than once.

201
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:22,348
He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

202
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:27,686
Your way down to Castle Black?

203
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:32,758
Where did he kill a white walker?

204
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:37,463
Where are you from?

205
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,899
How'd you come to meet my son?

206
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,768
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

207
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,288
- Where?
- Gilly.

208
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,774
- North of the Wall.
- North of the Wall?

209
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:55,248
You're a wildling.

210
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,659
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries

211
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:11,826
and here I sit hosting one in my hall

212
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:13,499
thanks to my son.

213
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,270
See that sword?

214
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,076
It's called Heartsbane.

215
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:26,879
It's been in our family for 500 years.

216
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:29,048
It's Valyrian steel.

217
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,617
Only a handful of them
left in the world.

218
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:35,588
It's supposed to go to my
firstborn son after I die.

219
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,323
To him.

220
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,995
He will never wield that sword.

221
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:46,199
If he were to become
Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

222
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,601
it would be the end of this house.

223
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:54,240
I took you for a Mole's
Town whore when I saw you

224
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:55,908
and I made my peace with that.

225
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,776
Who else would have him?

226
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,347
But I overestimated him.

227
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:04,617
No.

228
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:10,556
It was a wildling whore
that seduced my son.

229
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,827
This you getting back at me, boy?

230
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:21,167
Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

231
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:26,072
And you got what you
were after, didn't you?

232
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:30,443
A bastard. A half-breed bastard.

233
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:33,112
Your invitation into our home.

234
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,249
Come, my dear. Talla.

235
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,419
I've lost my appetite.

236
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:40,886
He dishonors us.

237
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,856
You dishonor yourself.

238
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:51,230
Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.

239
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:58,337
To please her, I'll take the wildling
in. She can work in the kitchens.

240
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,441
The bastard will be raised here.

241
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:07,846
But this will be the last night
you ever spend at Horn Hill.

242
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:18,824
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.

243
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:22,295
I was afraid he'd turn
you and Little Sam away.

244
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,298
I'm not angry at you.

245
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,433
I'm angry that horrible people

246
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:30,035
can treat good people that
way and get away with it.

247
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,577
When do you have to go?

248
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:42,582
First light.

249
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:54,960
Say good-bye to him for me.

250
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,339
You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.

251
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:08,907
He doesn't know what you are.

252
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:14,247
Good-bye, Gilly.

253
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,459
- Sam?
- We're leaving.

254
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:02,395
- What?
- Get your things.

255
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:05,531
I don't have any things.

256
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:08,467
- What are you doing?
- We belong together.

257
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,469
All of us.

258
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:13,105
What about your mother and sister?

259
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,140
Oh, they'll understand.

260
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:16,909
Your sister's dress.

261
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:18,877
She won't mind.

262
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:22,682
Looks better on you anyway.

263
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:24,750
Sam.

264
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,919
That's your father's sword.

265
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:29,054
It's my family's sword.

266
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:35,628
Sam.

267
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,231
Won't he come for it?

268
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:42,034
He can bloody well try.

269
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:48,474
The lion and the rose are one.

270
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:50,610
I thank the gods above.

271
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:53,212
And to you, my beauteous bride,

272
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:55,348
I pledge undying love.

273
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,752
Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.

274
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:02,488
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

275
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,923
for there is no one fairer.

276
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:09,228
Dear Uncle, will you share my
joy and be my royal cupbearer?

277
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,097
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

278
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,433
from this cup of sweet wine.

279
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:17,069
The last drink he shall ever take.

280
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:19,104
And vengeance shall be mine.

281
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,918
Poison!

282
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,787
Murder!

283
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:37,290
I gasp. I... I die.

284
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:42,227
I limp.

285
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,736
And it was he...

286
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,667
...that poisoned me.

287
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:50,670
My evil Uncle Imp.

288
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:58,477
Calm down, dear.

289
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,817
My firstborn son.

290
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,320
My golden lion

291
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,922
foully, falsely slain.

292
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,193
I pray you found a lasting peace

293
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,462
free from strife and pain.

294
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,200
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

295
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,135
Take my life instead.

296
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:27,105
For I cannot face another day
when my sweet boy is dead.

297
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,108
Oh, woe.

298
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:32,177
Oh, grief.

299
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:36,949
Oh, darkest day, my heart
is full of sorrow.

300
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,887
All hope is lost.

301
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,023
All joy is gone.

302
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:51,129
And there is no tomorrow.

303
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:13,753
What is that I hear and smell?

304
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,522
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

305
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:19,191
It's time to see if truth they told

306
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:22,928
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

307
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:27,132
You beast. You beast.

308
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:32,070
You killed my wife and now
you've taken your father's life.

309
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,940
No worse child ever stained this land.

310
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,543
Curse the day I named you.

311
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,623
My greatest crime. Now I must flee.

312
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:53,526
Then sail across the Narrow Sea

313
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:57,763
to do unto you more treachery.

314
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:01,567
Don't fear winter. Fear me!

315
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,440
Thank you.

316
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:11,109
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bianca,

317
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,145
Clarenzo.

318
00:27:13,247 --> 00:27:16,882
I give you Bobono.

319
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:19,418
I give you Camello.

320
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,787
And last but not least,

321
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:24,022
sweet Lady Crane.

322
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,838
Give this a good beating. Shake
those fleas out. That's a dear.

323
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,073
That crowd was shit.

324
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Girl.

325
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,915
What are you doing back here?

326
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,416
Nothing.

327
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,887
I saw you the other day in the audience.

328
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:57,923
How many times have you
seen this stupid play?

329
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:00,893
Three times.

330
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:02,695
Did you pay?

331
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:04,964
No.

332
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,769
I remember when the players
came to my village.

333
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:13,472
I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.

334
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:15,741
Just like you.

335
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:17,943
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

336
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,612
listened to the songs,

337
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:23,148
cried when the young lovers
died in each other's arms.

338
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,019
I ran off and joined them the
next day, never looked back.

339
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:29,955
You're very good.

340
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:31,790
My final speech is shit.

341
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:35,160
But to be fair to myself,
which I always like to be,

342
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:37,496
the writing's no good.

343
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:39,498
So change it.

344
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:44,069
It would all just be farting,
belching, and slapping without you.

345
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:47,640
How would you change it?

346
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,248
The queen loves her son
more than anything.

347
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,384
And he was taken from her
before she could say good-bye.

348
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:01,486
She wouldn't just cry.

349
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,993
She would be angry.

350
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,663
She would want to kill the
person who did this to her.

351
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,035
What's your name?

352
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:19,872
Mercy.

353
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,675
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

354
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:25,343
Wonderful eyebrows.

355
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,581
Do you like pretending
to be other people?

356
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:33,052
I have to go. My
father's waiting for me.

357
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,963
Lady Crane, they loved you.

358
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,832
They were sweet. Or drunk.

359
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:49,001
Drunkenly sweet.

360
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,669
No laugh for Ned's death.

361
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,473
These people are worse than animals.

362
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,376
But they loved her. They all love her.

363
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:02,247
Yes, you are adored by
people and animals alike.

364
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:04,883
I do what I can with what I'm given.

365
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,885
With what you're given?

366
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:08,821
Well, I was thinking...

367
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:10,422
Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

368
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:13,325
Full to the tits with ideas.

369
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:16,729
- I didn't mean...
- You have ideas, I have ideas,

370
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,597
he has ideas.

371
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,399
Why should my ideas have
any more value than yours

372
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:24,803
simply because I've been
doing this my whole life?

373
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:27,106
Who is anyone to judge my work?

374
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:29,975
This is my profession.
I know what I'm doing.

375
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,011
You have no right to an opinion.

376
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:47,592
Careful of that one.

377
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:53,465
She wants you dead.

378
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,306
And?

379
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:36,641
As I expected.

380
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:40,079
A shame.

381
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:42,181
A girl had many gifts.

382
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,052
You promised me.

383
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:55,227
Don't let her suffer.

384
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:49,748
Company, halt!

385
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:52,617
My lord.

386
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,552
My lord.

387
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,958
My friends, the hour has come.

388
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,796
Madness has overtaken this city

389
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,500
and grasped in its claws my children.

390
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,770
But now we must drive it back

391
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:14,940
under the rocks whence it came.

392
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:19,577
Madness has had its day!

393
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:25,083
Forward, march!

394
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:31,389
Rich or poor, noble or common,

395
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:35,660
if we sin, we must atone.

396
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,731
Margaery of House Tyrell

397
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,267
came to us a sinner.

398
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:47,406
She stood before the gods
in the holy sept and lied.

399
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:50,442
She turned a blind eye
to her brother's sins.

400
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:53,111
She disgraced her house,

401
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:56,481
her king, and herself.

402
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,948
Company, halt!

403
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,317
Face front!

404
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:34,152
Turn!

405
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,823
Lord Tyrell.

406
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:41,193
Ser Jaime.

407
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:43,195
Sorry to interrupt.

408
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,998
We're here for Queen Margaery
and Ser Loras Tyrell.

409
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,368
Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

410
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:53,571
I don't have the authority
to give them to you.

411
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:56,508
And you don't have the
authority to take them.

412
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,443
That's right.

413
00:35:07,154 --> 00:35:10,188
Lock spears!

414
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:14,459
I speak for King Tommen of House
Baratheon, First of His Name.

415
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:17,629
The gods don't recognize his
authority in this matter.

416
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:20,465
You've already insulted one great house.

417
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,534
It won't happen twice.

418
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,869
Every last sparrow will die

419
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:27,439
before Margaery Tyrell
walks down that street.

420
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:30,042
To die in the service of the gods

421
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:32,344
would please each and every one of us.

422
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,779
We yearn for it.

423
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:46,325
But there is no call for it today.

424
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:52,197
There will be no walk of atonement.

425
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,582
Order up.

426
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:13,651
Queen Margaery has already
atoned for her sins

427
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,754
by bringing another

428
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:18,957
into the true light of the Seven.

429
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:52,157
Together we announce

430
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:54,792
a new age of harmony.

431
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,762
A holy alliance

432
00:36:57,864 --> 00:37:01,400
between the Crown and the Faith.

433
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,552
Long live King Tommen and
bless you, Queen Margaery!

434
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:23,055
The Crown and the Faith

435
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,891
are the twin pillars upon
which the world rests.

436
00:37:26,993 --> 00:37:32,097
Together we will restore the
Seven Kingdoms to glory.

437
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,617
What's happening?

438
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,719
He's beaten us.

439
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,688
That's what's happening.

440
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:14,573
When you attack the Faith,
you attack the Crown.

441
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:17,642
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

442
00:38:17,744 --> 00:38:20,345
to serve as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

443
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:24,382
I've been a member of the Kingsguard
since before you were born.

444
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:29,321
You don't have to do this. You
don't have to do anything.

445
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:33,658
I have to answer to the gods.

446
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,994
Not when you're sitting in that chair.

447
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,734
The Crown's decision on
this matter is final.

448
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,805
Will I be walking naked in the streets?

449
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:50,408
Or will I spend a few months
in the sept dungeons first

450
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,644
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

451
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,153
You have served your house and your
king faithfully for many years.

452
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,488
And you will continue to do so.

453
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,192
But not in this city.

454
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:13,831
You've lost it?

455
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:16,868
Yes, Father.

456
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,904
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

457
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:23,175
Presumably you still know where it is.

458
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,876
You didn't lose Riverrun.

459
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:27,111
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

460
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:30,182
He surprised us. He knows the
castle better than anyone.

461
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,652
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

462
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:36,754
You had him right here in this
hall and you let him leave.

463
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:39,357
Then when I told you to
hunt him down and kill him,

464
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,825
you couldn't find him.

465
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,027
That's what it means to lose something.

466
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:46,565
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

467
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,833
I don't think it's fair to blame us...

468
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:52,204
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

469
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:56,208
swore oaths to them and their
stinking fish banners.

470
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,543
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

471
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:00,978
Take it back!

472
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:02,614
We don't have the men.

473
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:06,050
We've got 10 times as many
men as the damn Blackfish.

474
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:09,187
The Mallisters have risen against us.
And the Blackwoods.

475
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:12,490
The Brotherhood Without Banners is
rallying the commoners against us,

476
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:14,526
raiding our supply trains and camps.

477
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,662
Riverrun can withstand
a siege for a year.

478
00:40:18,368 --> 00:40:21,099
If I want excuses, I'll
put her in charge.

479
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,967
They're laughing at us.

480
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:24,936
All across the Riverlands

481
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,771
right down to King's Landing,

482
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,506
they're laughing at us.

483
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:31,142
I hear it in my sleep!

484
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:34,246
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

485
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:39,083
And I'll not leave this world until
they all choke on that laughter.

486
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:41,720
Take that castle back.

487
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:45,690
He'll never yield, Father.

488
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,293
Oh, he'll yield.

489
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:55,533
You'll show him the knife you used

490
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:59,337
to kill Robb Stark's child
in his whore mother's belly,

491
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,706
and you'll show him the knife you used

492
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:03,941
to open his niece's throat.

493
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:06,010
And you'll remind him who it was

494
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:09,981
that got married at the Red
Wedding in the first place.

495
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,750
His nephew.

496
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,634
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

497
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:31,803
You're going home.

498
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:35,407
I'm being sent to deal
with the Blackfish.

499
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:38,376
Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

500
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:40,278
because he's 400 years old.

501
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,880
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands

502
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:44,849
and a siege that could last months.

503
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:47,385
Better you're elsewhere
at the head of an army

504
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:49,053
than in the sept dungeons.

505
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,023
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

506
00:41:55,094 --> 00:41:56,328
What, then?

507
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,636
I'm going to give Bronn the largest
bag of gold anyone's ever seen

508
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:03,501
and have him gather the
best killers he knows.

509
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:06,971
I'll take them to the sept and I'll
remove the High Sparrow's head

510
00:42:07,073 --> 00:42:08,906
and every other sparrow head I can find.

511
00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:12,577
- You can't.
- He has our son! He stole our son!

512
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,679
He's torn our family apart.

513
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,114
How should we treat
people who tear us apart?

514
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:21,285
We should treat them
without mercy and we will.

515
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:24,222
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the sept alive.

516
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:27,359
And without you, this
is all for nothing.

517
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,829
Stand at the head of our
army where you belong,

518
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,231
where Father wanted you.

519
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,700
Show our men where their
loyalties belong.

520
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:37,802
Show them what Lannisters are,

521
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:39,838
what we do to our enemies.

522
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:43,441
And take that stupid little castle back

523
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:45,744
because it's ours and because you can.

524
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:48,946
You'll stand trial soon. I
need to be here for you.

525
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:53,217
It will be a trial by combat.

526
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:55,687
I have the Mountain.

527
00:42:57,924 --> 00:43:00,592
They've made us both
stronger, all of them.

528
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:03,995
They have no idea how strong we are.

529
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,819
No idea what we're going to do to them.

530
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,411
We've always been together.

531
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,079
We'll always be together.

532
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:24,616
We're the only two people in the world.

533
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,404
Why did you help us?

534
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:51,443
The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.

535
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,744
The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.

536
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:54,913
Now he lives again.

537
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:10,294
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

538
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:13,565
A fearless boy.

539
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,734
Loved to climb the castle
walls, frighten his mother.

540
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,236
Who are you?

541
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,523
Uncle Benjen.

542
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:41,359
The last letter Jon wrote me

543
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,294
said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

544
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:48,867
I led a ranging party
deep into the North

545
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:51,703
to find white walkers.

546
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:53,404
They found us.

547
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:57,341
A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.

548
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,345
Left me there to die.

549
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:02,847
To turn.

550
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,517
The Children found me.

551
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,820
Stopped the walker's
magic from taking hold.

552
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,221
How?

553
00:45:10,323 --> 00:45:12,624
The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

554
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:14,058
You saw it yourself.

555
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:17,862
Dragonglass.

556
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:20,965
A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

557
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,970
You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.

558
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:29,007
I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

559
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:34,078
You must learn to control it

560
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,080
before the Night King comes.

561
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:40,351
Drink.

562
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:45,557
One way or another,

563
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,359
he will find his way
to the world of men.

564
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:50,862
When he does,

565
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:54,131
you will be there waiting for him.

566
00:45:54,233 --> 00:45:57,501
And you will be ready.

567
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:20,291
Everything all right?

568
00:46:20,393 --> 00:46:22,426
How many days' ride to Meereen?

569
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:24,361
A week at best.

570
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:27,865
How many ships will I need to
bring my khalasar to Westeros?

571
00:46:27,968 --> 00:46:30,068
Dothraki and all their horses,

572
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:32,503
the Unsullied, the Second Sons...

573
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,472
a 1,000 ships easily.

574
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:36,708
- Probably more.
- And who has that many?

575
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,309
Nobody.

576
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:40,444
Nobody yet.

577
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:46,017
So we ride for Meereen and after
that we sail for Westeros.

578
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,619
And what then?

579
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,488
I take what is mine.

580
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,424
You weren't made to sit
on a chair in a palace.

581
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:55,860
What was I made for?

582
00:46:55,962 --> 00:46:59,631
You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

583
00:47:08,808 --> 00:47:10,307
Wait here.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
