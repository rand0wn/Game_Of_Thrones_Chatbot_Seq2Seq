3
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:57,613
Yes?

4
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:02,759
For you, my lady.

5
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,224
How far is Mole's Town?

6
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,416
Sansa.

7
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,185
Lady Brienne.

8
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:46,372
When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

9
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,453
You have no idea how happy I am

10
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,415
to see you unharmed.

11
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,446
Unharmed?

12
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,619
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:59,728
I rode north with the Knights
of the Vale to come to your aid.

14
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:02,307
They're encamped at
Moat Cailin as we speak.

15
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:03,935
To come to my aid?

16
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:07,671
Did you know about Ramsay?

17
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,019
If you didn't know, you're an idiot.
If you did know, you're my enemy.

18
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:17,061
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

19
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:21,085
He never hurt my face.

20
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:24,732
He needed my face,
the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

21
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,191
But the rest of me,

22
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:37,832
he did what he liked with the rest of me
as long as I could still give him an heir.

23
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,477
What do you think he did?

24
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:50,189
- I can't begin to contemplate...
- What do you think he did to me?

25
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,094
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

26
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:03,519
He beat you.

27
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,177
Yes, he enjoyed that.
What else do you think he did?

28
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,473
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

29
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,124
Did he cut you?

30
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:17,702
- Maybe you did know about
Ramsay all along. - I didn't know.

31
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,655
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

32
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:21,146
I made a mistake,

33
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:25,482
a horrible mistake.
I underestimated a stranger.

34
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:29,709
The other things he did, ladies
aren't supposed to talk about those things,

35
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,083
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

36
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,707
I can still feel it.

37
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:40,797
I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

38
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:44,974
I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

39
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm so sorry.

40
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:52,317
You said you would protect me.

41
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:53,370
And I will.

42
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,363
- You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
- I don't believe you anymore.

43
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,054
I don't need you anymore.
You can't protect me.

44
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:05,389
You won't even be able to protect
yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

45
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,938
And why shouldn't I?

46
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,264
Do you want me to beg for my life?

47
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,203
If that's what you want, I will.

48
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,818
Whatever you ask that is in my power,

49
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,172
I will do.

50
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,646
What if I want you to die here and now?

51
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:30,740
Then I will die.

52
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,196
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

53
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:40,621
and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

54
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,813
Go back to Moat Cailin.

55
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:48,634
My brother and I will take back the North
on our own. I never want to see you again.

56
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:52,250
I would do anything to
undo what's been done to you.

57
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:56,051
I know that I can't.

58
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:01,030
Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

59
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:07,047
Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish

60
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:11,034
has gathered what remains of
the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

61
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,222
You might consider seeking him out.

62
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:16,451
The time may come when
you need an army loyal to you.

63
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:19,619
- I have an army.
- Your brother's army.

64
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,767
Half-brother.

65
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,651
You're not ready.

66
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,793
You should go home before it's too late.

67
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:05,115
You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

68
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,293
She has a point.

69
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,806
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

70
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:34,706
They began as slaves
in the mines of Valyria.

71
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,781
- Who was the first?
- He was no one.

72
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:43,806
The Many-Faced God taught him how
to shed his face and how to give the gift.

73
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:47,179
The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

74
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:51,029
Many served,
many more gifts were given.

75
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,830
Soon all the masters
and overseers were gone

76
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,124
and the Faceless Men fled.

77
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,077
Where did they go?

78
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,302
Here.

79
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:03,666
They founded the Free City
of Braavos and built this house.

80
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,592
These were the faces they wore in life

81
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:10,054
when they were not wearing others.

82
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:12,664
The first Faceless Men.

83
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:18,623
And now a girl is one of them,
if a girl desires.

84
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,691
A girl has no desires.

85
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:31,468
Who?

86
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:41,782
An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.

87
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,696
She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.

88
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,848
A girl has been given a second chance.

89
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,741
There will not be a third.

90
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:56,719
One way or another,
a face will be added to the hall.

91
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:25,818
Oh, murdered by a boar.
The great big hairy whore.

92
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:29,552
He dug in his tusks
and dug out my guts

93
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,110
and soon I am no more.

94
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,105
Oh, come, Father,
in bed you must lie.

95
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:39,425
I love you, Father.
Please don't die.

96
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:42,939
Shut up, you swine!
Cersei, more wine.

97
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,499
I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

98
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,499
And our son alone on that cold,
cold throne without a guiding hand.

99
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,456
Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

100
00:10:56,466 --> 00:11:00,107
To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

101
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,898
Ned Stark will do fine.
Now bring me more wine.

102
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,572
Ooh, what's happened here, then?

103
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:15,065
He brought you here, Ned Stark,
'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.

104
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:19,038
You should be king of us all
and I should be your Hand.

105
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:23,283
We men of the North are right
good hands at keeping people lawful.

106
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,222
I'd ask him for permission,
but he smells too bloody awful.

107
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,550
I die!

108
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,491
I die! And here I now must lie.

109
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,241
Oh, woe. Oh, no.

110
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:46,224
Oh, I am about to go.

111
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:51,355
- Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
- The Iron Throne's what I demand.

112
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,549
- You cannot.
- I can.

113
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,652
- You will not.
- I will.

114
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:55,277
- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

115
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,478
- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?

116
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,324
- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?

117
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:02,426
- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

118
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:19,225
So move along, give me my chair
and there won't be no more trouble.

119
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,824
But we had a deal all done and dusted.

120
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,713
I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.

121
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,285
- Save my father.
- Truly you should.

122
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,464
Killing the man will do you no good.

123
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:47,128
- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

124
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,505
Show the people what
a good king should be.

125
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,840
Good people, you may all relax.

126
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,440
My father's friend shall be spared the...

127
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,418
<i>Father! No!</i>

128
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:01,754
Oh, Father. Oh!

129
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:14,380
Worry not!
All is well.

130
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:19,233
I have here a decree
from my father Tywin Lannister,

131
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,568
the richest man you'll see.

132
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:24,132
He proclaims me Hand of the King.

133
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,319
The position's mine for life.

134
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:31,321
And he's given me permission
to take Sansa as my wife.

135
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,140
You'll learn that what I lack in height,
I make up for in appetite.

136
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:43,162
So let's forget about your plight,
and go rehearse our wedding night.

137
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,801
It's a wart. Two warts.
I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

138
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,778
Well, don't worry, love.
They usually go away in five or six years.

139
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:04,175
Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.

140
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:06,484
You can do better, Bianca, dear.

141
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:07,558
You must do.

142
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,294
I had two lines.

143
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:11,967
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

144
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:13,516
I rang very false?

145
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:16,654
What you need, love,
is for someone to ring you true.

146
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,704
- You weren't complaining about me last night.
- May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?

147
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,907
I'm a rum girl, Bobono.

148
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:28,903
- You need to know that if we're going to be
intimate. - Of course we're going to be intimate.

149
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,064
It's only a matter of time.

150
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,509
- To our children.
- May they have your talent.

151
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,235
And your filthy mind.

152
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:49,359
A girl will poison the rum.

153
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:51,967
Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.

154
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:59,408
If a girl could use one
of the faces from the hall...

155
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,243
A girl is not ready.

156
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,128
She's a good actress.

157
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:08,270
So a man has heard.

158
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:11,539
Seems like a decent woman.

159
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:18,738
Does death only come for
the wicked and leave the decent behind?

160
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:21,645
No.

161
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,288
Who wants her dead?

162
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:30,272
That does not matter.
The price was paid.

163
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,976
The younger actress.

164
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,724
She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.

165
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:42,066
A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

166
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,197
A girl has decided.

167
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,750
A servant does not ask questions.

168
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,425
No! No! No!

169
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,503
It was you.

170
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,261
You made the white walkers.

171
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,126
We were at war.

172
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,585
We were being slaughtered.

173
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:34,777
Our sacred trees cut down.

174
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,496
We needed to defend ourselves.

175
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,645
From whom?

176
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,620
From you.

177
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,316
From men.

178
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:56,167
We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.

179
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,752
In his name we gather today
to choose a new king as our leader.

180
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,520
Who makes a claim?

181
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,858
I am Yara Greyjoy,

182
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:16,120
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,
King of the Iron Islands.

183
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:21,308
- I claim the Salt Throne.
- We've never had a queen.

184
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,518
- Not once.
- There are many things we've never done.

185
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:28,106
We've never made
our mark upon the world.

186
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:31,846
The great lords
of Westeros pay us no mind

187
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:36,538
until our little raids buzz through their
kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance.

188
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,290
Then they swat us down.

189
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:41,753
They conquer us, humiliate us,

190
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,917
and go right back to forgetting we exist.

191
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,200
<i>Aye!</i>

192
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,381
<i>- We are a sea people.
- Aye!</i>

193
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,142
<i>- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!</i>

194
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:54,615
When I am queen,
we will build a fleet that...

195
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:56,382
- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

196
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:59,649
Yes, you are!
A woman will not lead us.

197
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:02,862
Not when Balon's own
male heir has returned.

198
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,880
I am Theon Greyjoy...

199
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,316
last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

200
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,446
And she is your rightful ruler.

201
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,728
<i>Aye!</i>

202
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:52,007
Those of you that have sailed under her,
and there are many of you here,

203
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,308
<i>- you know what she is.
- Aye!</i>

204
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,332
<i>- She is a reaver.
- Aye!</i>

205
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,152
<i>- She is a warrior.
- Aye!</i>

206
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,590
<i>- She is ironborn!
- Aye!</i>

207
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:04,073
We will find no better leader.

208
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,894
This is our queen.

209
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,249
<i>Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>

210
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,402
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

211
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:23,690
I claim the Salt Throne.

212
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,488
Niece.

213
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,501
Nephew.

214
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,671
Little Theon.

215
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:47,889
Heard you managed to fuck
things right into the ground.

216
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,095
Captured a castle you couldn't keep.

217
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:53,492
Got yourself taken prisoner.

218
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,328
Even heard you have no cock.

219
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,792
Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

220
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:05,533
- When did you return, Uncle?
- A few days ago.

221
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,132
I had some things to take care of.

222
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,023
Long overdue.

223
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:14,484
I'm glad you're here.

224
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:19,392
Now I know what my
first act as queen will be.

225
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,018
To execute the man who killed my father.

226
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:30,849
I did.

227
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:32,737
I killed him.

228
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:38,257
Threw him right over
a rope bridge and watched him fall.

229
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:42,071
He was leading us nowhere

230
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:45,003
and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

231
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,439
No one loved him.

232
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:50,631
No one wanted to follow him.
He led us into two wars we couldn't win.

233
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,784
I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

234
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,857
That would have been hard to do.

235
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:58,583
You weren't here.

236
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,746
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

237
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:04,081
Gallivanting?

238
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,277
That the sort of thing you start
to say once your dick gets chopped off?

239
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:11,959
Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?

240
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,219
You were gone.

241
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:18,959
Yara was here.
Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.

242
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,404
Getting ready to bring us back to glory.

243
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:24,161
And how will she do that?

244
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,420
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

245
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:34,715
Right idea, except I'm the one
who's going to build the Iron Fleet

246
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:37,218
because I'm the one
who knows how to use it.

247
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,595
I've been all over the world.
I've seen more of it than all of you combined.

248
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:48,938
And across the sea there is a person who hates
the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.

249
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:55,366
Someone with a large army,
three large dragons, and no husband.

250
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,710
I'm going to build that fleet

251
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,273
and I'm going to gallivant right over

252
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:04,545
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen
along with my big cock.

253
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:07,063
You're going to
seduce the Dragon Queen?

254
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:10,238
I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

255
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:13,350
And together we're going
to take the Seven Kingdoms.

256
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,449
I wasn't born to be king.

257
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,992
I paid the iron price and here I stand.

258
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:26,357
<i>Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!</i>

259
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,204
<i>Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!</i>

260
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:32,114
<i>Euron! Euron! Euron!</i>

261
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,647
May Euron, your servant,
be born again from the sea as you were.

262
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,786
<i>Bless him with salt.</i>

263
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,579
<i>Bless him with stone.</i>

264
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,537
<i>Bless him with steel.</i>

265
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,387
<i>Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.</i>

266
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:00,259
<i>He is speaking to us and he says</i>

267
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,597
<i>we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.</i>

268
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,965
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

269
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,958
<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

270
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:14,014
<i>Let his lungs fill with seawater.</i>

271
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:23,274
<i>Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.</i>

272
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:28,987
<i>What is dead may never die,
but rises again harder and stronger.</i>

273
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:39,082
What is dead may never die.

274
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,727
<i>What is dead may never die.</i>

275
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:58,533
Where are my niece and nephew?

276
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:05,612
Let's go murder them.

277
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,753
They stole our best ships.

278
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:31,643
Won't be enough to save them.

279
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,919
Go back to your homes.

280
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:40,388
Chop down every tree you can find.
Quarter-saw the timber and start building.

281
00:26:40,562 --> 00:26:42,694
I want every man bending planks.

282
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:45,508
I want every woman spinning flax for sails.

283
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:50,745
Build me a thousand ships
and I will give you this world.

284
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,395
I banished you twice.

285
00:27:14,186 --> 00:27:17,445
You came back twice.

286
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,466
And you saved my life.

287
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:31,747
So I can't take you back
and I can't send you away.

288
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,862
You must send me away.

289
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:51,021
Is there a cure?

290
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:52,857
I don't know.

291
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,285
How long does it take?

292
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,700
I don't know that either.

293
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,321
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

294
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,784
I'll end things before that.

295
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,038
I'm sorry.

296
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,533
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

297
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:17,041
All I've ever wanted was to serve you.

298
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:23,021
Tyrion Lannister was right.

299
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:27,140
I love you.

300
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:34,627
I'll always love you.

301
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,278
Good-bye, khaleesi.

302
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,419
Do not walk away from your queen,
Jorah the Andal.

303
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:55,441
You have not been dismissed.

304
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:59,147
You pledged yourself to me.

305
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:03,069
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

306
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,157
Well, I command you to find the cure

307
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:11,079
wherever it is in this world.

308
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,848
I command you to heal yourself

309
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:19,108
and then return to me.

310
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,459
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

311
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,443
I need you by my side.

312
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:10,124
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

313
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:13,341
how many killings have been
carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?

314
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,754
None.

315
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,779
And how many Masters have
been butchered by the free men?

316
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:21,831
Two, but that was the day of the pact.
Since then, nothing.

317
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,527
So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

318
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:26,771
For now.

319
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:28,929
For now is the best
we get in our profession.

320
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,206
It's not enough.

321
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:34,057
Considering the city was on the
brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start.

322
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,591
It's not enough for
Meereen to have peace.

323
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,479
They need to know
Daenerys is responsible for it.

324
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:42,157
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

325
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:46,707
Resist the foreign invaders.
Our queen has an even better story.

326
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,781
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains and all that.

327
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,065
The people know
who brought them freedom.

328
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:56,643
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

329
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,652
Who brought about
an end to the violence?

330
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:01,478
We need someone the people trust,

331
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:04,814
someone they know
cannot be bought or influenced.

332
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:07,740
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

333
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,263
Who said anything about "him"?

334
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,604
_

335
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:18,413
_

336
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,189
_

337
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,590
_

338
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:25,439
_

339
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:35,150
_

340
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,788
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

341
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,418
Thank you for travelling all this way.

342
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:52,801
I know from personal experience
how uncomfortable the journey can be.

343
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:00,621
The truth is we need your help.

344
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,602
We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to...

345
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:05,373
You don't need to persuade me.

346
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,709
I came to help.

347
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,803
Daenerys Stormborn is
the one who was promised.

348
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:14,174
From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

349
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:16,515
Yes.

350
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,000
She has freed the slaves from their
chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.

351
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,529
She did indeed.

352
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,874
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

353
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:29,721
a gift from the Lord of Light.

354
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:35,087
But you heard all of this before,
haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

355
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,559
The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,

356
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:43,330
burning their sins and flesh away.

357
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:47,648
Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

358
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:51,038
The Mother of Dragons has
followers of many different faiths.

359
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,588
You want your queen
to be worshipped and obeyed.

360
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:59,069
And while she's gone, you want her
advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.

361
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:02,262
I'd settle for obeyed.

362
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,061
I will summon my most eloquent priests.

363
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:07,691
They will spread the word.

364
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:11,863
Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

365
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:16,111
in this war and in the
great war still to come.

366
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:19,516
- That sounds most excellent.
- A man named Stannis Baratheon

367
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:23,577
was anointed as the chosen
one by one of your priestesses.

368
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:26,596
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

369
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:31,996
He attacked King's Landing and was
soundly defeated by the man standing beside me.

370
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:34,716
Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

371
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:38,779
this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

372
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:41,929
We'd be most grateful for any
support you could provide the queen.

373
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,379
I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

374
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:48,389
Isn't that the whole
point of being a fanatic?

375
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:53,800
You're always right.
Everything is the Lord's will.

376
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:57,422
Everything is the Lord's will.

377
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,322
But men and women make mistakes.

378
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:02,656
Even honest servants of the Lord.

379
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:06,184
And you, an honest servant of the Lord,

380
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:11,043
why should I trust you to know any more
than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

381
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:17,000
My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,
but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.

382
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:26,037
Everyone is what they are
and where they are for a reason.

383
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,006
Terrible things happen for a reason.

384
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:35,197
Take what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when you were a child.

385
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:40,448
If not for your mutilation
at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,

386
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,835
you wouldn't be here

387
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:46,219
helping the Lord's Chosen
bring his light into the world.

388
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:49,600
Knowledge has made you powerful.

389
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,570
But there's still so much you don't know.

390
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,622
Do you remember
what you heard that night

391
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:02,461
when the sorcerer
tossed your parts in the fire?

392
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:08,346
You heard a voice call out
from the flames. Do you remember?

393
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:12,911
Should I tell you what the voice said?

394
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:18,135
Should I tell you the
name of the one who spoke?

395
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:29,929
We serve the same queen.

396
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:34,614
If you are her true friend,
you have nothing to fear from me.

397
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,116
What?

398
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:12,685
He saw me, the Night King!

399
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,970
- He saw me!
- He touched you.

400
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:17,572
I don't know. He was close, but...

401
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:18,855
He touched you.

402
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:23,972
He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

403
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,189
But he can't get in.

404
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,315
He can now.
His mark is on you.

405
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:31,955
You must leave, all of you.

406
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,380
Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.

407
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:38,454
Hodor.

408
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,417
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

409
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:44,749
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

410
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:47,436
For you to become me.

411
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,457
But am I ready?

412
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,944
No.

413
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,252
We can't defend the north from
the walkers and the south from the Boltons.

414
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:05,070
If we want to survive, we need Winterfell
and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

415
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:11,025
Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,

416
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,436
the most powerful houses in the North

417
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:17,280
are the Umbers,
the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.

418
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,350
The Umbers and the Karstarks

419
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,077
have already declared for the Boltons,
so we're not doing so well there.

420
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:27,536
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

421
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:32,378
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
without knowing they had another choice.

422
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:37,366
I beg your pardon, my lady, but they
know that a Stark beheaded their father.

423
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,939
I don't think we
can count on them either.

424
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,840
How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

425
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,461
Precious little, my lady.

426
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:48,195
My father always said
Northerners are different.

427
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:51,686
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

428
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:53,357
They may well be loyal,

429
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,735
but how many rose
up against the Boltons

430
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,845
when they betrayed your family?

431
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:02,526
I may not know the North,
but I know men.

432
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:06,654
They're more or less the same in any corner
of the world and even the bravest of them

433
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:11,312
don't want to see their wives
and children skinned for a lost cause.

434
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:14,676
If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

435
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:17,149
they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

436
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:19,224
There are more than three
other houses in the North...

437
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:22,087
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

438
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:23,771
Mazin, Hornwood.

439
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,181
Two dozen more.
Together they equal all the others.

440
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:30,203
We can start small and build.

441
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:31,755
The North remembers.

442
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:36,052
They remember the Stark name.
People will still risk everything for it, from

443
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:38,141
White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

444
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:39,378
I don't doubt it.

445
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:42,429
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

446
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,840
No, but I do.

447
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:51,589
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

448
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:54,034
And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,

449
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:57,035
but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.

450
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:59,104
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

451
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:02,689
My uncle the Blackfish has
reformed it and retaken Riverrun.

452
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,618
How do you know that?

453
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:09,004
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

454
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:12,091
That's good.

455
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,619
The Blackfish is a legend.
His support would mean a great deal.

456
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:23,018
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,
almost starts to look like a winning side.

457
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,040
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

458
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:28,962
You heard them. We need more men

459
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:30,746
and my uncle has an army.

460
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,739
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

461
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:35,973
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
It has to be you.

462
00:42:36,338 --> 00:42:40,289
Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk
to you and you'll know how to talk to him.

463
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:44,532
What is it?

464
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:48,616
I don't like leaving you here alone.

465
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:49,669
With Jon?

466
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:52,648
Not him. He seems trustworthy.

467
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:54,536
A bit brooding, perhaps.

468
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:57,264
I suppose that's understandable, considering.

469
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:00,258
The others, though.

470
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:06,073
Davos and the Red Woman
helped a man murder his own brother

471
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,282
with bloodmagic.

472
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:11,025
And when Stannis paid for
his crime, where were they?

473
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:14,096
Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

474
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:17,215
And that wildling fellow with the beard...

475
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:18,573
Jon isn't Tormund.

476
00:43:18,926 --> 00:43:22,990
Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman
or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.

477
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,939
He's my brother.
He'll keep me safe. I trust him.

478
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,590
Then why did you lie to him when he
asked you how you learned about Riverrun?

479
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,679
New dress?

480
00:43:45,507 --> 00:43:47,480
I made it myself. Do you like it?

481
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:50,932
Yeah, it's...
I like the wolf bit.

482
00:43:52,093 --> 00:43:55,945
Good, because I made this for you.

483
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:00,920
I made it like the one Father used to wear.

484
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:04,081
As near as I can remember.

485
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:07,624
Thank you, Sansa.

486
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,233
You're welcome.

487
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:31,748
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

488
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:33,501
I'll do my best.

489
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:41,144
Good luck.

490
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:14,874
Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?

491
00:45:15,205 --> 00:45:16,829
I'm not the Lord Comman...

492
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:26,432
Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.

493
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,230
We can go home now, Hodor.

494
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:44,693
Well, maybe not home home,
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

495
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:46,237
Hodor.

496
00:45:46,248 --> 00:45:48,347
Eat something that isn't moss.

497
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:53,507
I want an egg.
How do you like 'em?

498
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:56,305
Boiled? Fried up with some butter?

499
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:57,552
Hodor.

500
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:01,205
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

501
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:02,275
Hodor.

502
00:47:02,817 --> 00:47:04,785
Get Bran and run!

503
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:19,286
Bran. Bran, wake up.

504
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:20,500
Bran!

505
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:22,030
Hodor. Hodor.

506
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:23,641
Bran, wake up.

507
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,293
<i>- Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
- Take it easy.</i>

508
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,627
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

509
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:43,051
- Hodor.
- Hodor.

510
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:44,628
Hodor.

511
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:46,723
Help me!

512
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:07,531
Go!

513
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:09,516
Go!

514
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,321
Remember that you are a Stark.

515
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:01,824
Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale

516
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:05,276
- and try to stay out of fights.
- Yes, Father.

517
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:09,894
But if you have to fight...

518
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:11,259
win.

519
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,874
Bran! Bran, wake up!

520
00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:28,498
Bran!

521
00:49:28,891 --> 00:49:30,333
Bran! Bran, wake up.

522
00:49:30,364 --> 00:49:32,745
- Bran! Bran, wake up!
- Hodor. Hodor.

523
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:40,587
You have to wake up.

524
00:49:40,618 --> 00:49:42,653
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

525
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:44,377
Bran, we need Hodor.
Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.

526
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:51,292
Hodor. Hodor.

527
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:01,776
Bran, we're all going to die!

528
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,357
<i>Bran, wake up!</i>

529
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,192
<i>We're all going to die! Bran!</i>

530
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:06,729
<i>Bran!</i>

531
00:50:07,153 --> 00:50:09,076
Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.

532
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,597
Hodor. Hodor.

533
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,601
Warg into Hodor now!

534
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,822
<i>Bran, wake up. We need Hodor.</i>

535
00:50:15,493 --> 00:50:18,433
<i>We need Hodor.
Warg into Hodor now! Now!</i>

536
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,377
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

537
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,495
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

538
00:50:23,656 --> 00:50:25,241
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

539
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:26,830
Hodor. Hodor.

540
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:04,677
- Summer!
- Go.

541
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:06,801
Go!

542
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:46,667
<i>The time has come.</i>

543
00:51:49,322 --> 00:51:50,365
Leave me.

544
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:18,481
What are you doing?

545
00:52:18,492 --> 00:52:19,570
Go!

546
00:53:08,327 --> 00:53:09,676
Hodor, hurry!

547
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:11,372
Hodor!

548
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,854
Hold the door!

549
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,351

Hold the door!

00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,339
<i>- Hold the door!
- Wylis!</i>

554
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:04,903
What's the matter?

555
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:06,302
<i>Hold the door!</i>

556
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:07,511
Come on, son.
