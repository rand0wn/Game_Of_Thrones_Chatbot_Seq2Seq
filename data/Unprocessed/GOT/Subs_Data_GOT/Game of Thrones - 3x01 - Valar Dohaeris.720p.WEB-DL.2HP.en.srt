1
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:23,086
( wind howling )

2
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,189
( panting )

3
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,489
( breathing heavily )

4
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,726
Brother?

5
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,091
( snow crunching )

6
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,578
( Ghost snarling )

7
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,644
Did you send the ravens?

8
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:33,051
Tarly, look at me.

9
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,722
Did you send the ravens?

10
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,261
<i>That was your job.</i>

11
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,064
Your only job.

12
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:57,242
We need to get
back to the Wall.

13
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,911
<i>It's a long march.</i>

14
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,680
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

15
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:06,484
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

16
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:09,354
or before winter's done,

17
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:11,556
everyone you've ever known

18
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,391
will be dead.

19
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:25,841

20
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:07,512
( wind blowing )

21
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:42,581
( people talking indistinctly )

22
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,141
First time you've seen
a giant, Jon Snow?

23
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,781
Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

24
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:20,420
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

25
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:22,589
And when they're angry,

26
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:25,726
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

27
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,761
like a hammer on a nail.

28
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:36,570
( growling )

29
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:40,073
- Man: <i>Crow!</i>
- Boy: <i>Crow!</i>

30
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,210
- Girl: <i>Look over there!</i>
- Man #2: <i>Crow!</i>

31
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,078
Girl: <i>Crow! Look over here!
Look!</i>

32
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:49,248
Woman:
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

33
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,984
Boy:
<i>Crow!</i>

34
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:55,388
Ygritte: You're wearing
the wrong color.

35
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,924
Mance was a ranger.

36
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,063
In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.

37
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:04,998
When I'm free,
will I be free to go?

38
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,033
- Crow!
- Crow!

39
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,368
Sure, you will.

40
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:10,603
- Oh!
- ( laughter )

41
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,507
And I'll be free to kill you.

42
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,143
<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

43
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,347
Got no fathers to slap 'em
when they're foul.

44
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,716
What happened to their fathers?

45
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:26,987
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

46
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,458
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

47
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,528
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

48
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,431
And if he don't...

49
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,655
I smell a crow.

50
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,890
We killed his friends.

51
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,726
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

52
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,863
What do we want
with a baby crow?

53
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,833
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

54
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:15,069
<i>He wants to be one of us.</i>

55
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:23,778
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

56
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,214
Friends twice your size.

57
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:31,786
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

58
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:35,290
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

59
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:38,159
Plenty of little men

60
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:41,129
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

61
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:43,931
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

62
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,633
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

63
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:50,705
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

64
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:58,914
Your Grace.

65
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:01,183
( laughter )

66
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,652
- Your Grace?
- ( laughter )

67
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:05,354
Did you hear that?

68
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:08,457
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

69
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,893
( laughs ) Stand, boy.

70
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,032
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

71
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,907
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

72
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,075
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

73
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,779
You can leave us.

74
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,089
The girl likes you.

75
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,291
You like her back, Snow?

76
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:44,694
That why you want to join us?

77
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:46,496
Bearded warrior:
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

78
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,732
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

79
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,968
where we make you
swear off girls.

80
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:54,671
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

81
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:57,141
Can't believe this pup

82
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,476
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

83
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,711
He was our enemy

84
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:04,614
and I'm glad he's dead.

85
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,092
He was my brother once.

86
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,795
Back when he had a whole hand.

87
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:23,332
What were you doing with him?

88
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:26,669
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

89
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:28,537
Why?

90
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,339
He wants me to lead one day.

91
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:33,843
But here you are, a traitor

92
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:36,345
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

93
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:39,949
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

94
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:50,560
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

95
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,501
I want to be free.

96
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:01,671
No, I don't think so.

97
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,874
I think what you want
most of all

98
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,109
is to be a hero.

99
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:11,047
I'll ask you
one last time--

100
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:14,116
why do you want to join us?

101
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:22,157
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

102
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:26,061
I saw...

103
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,662
You saw what?

104
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:32,033
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

105
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,802
and leave it in the woods.

106
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,104
I saw what took it.

107
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:44,746
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

108
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:50,086
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

109
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,189
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

110
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:55,224
he already knew.

111
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,829
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

112
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:03,199
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

113
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:07,203
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

114
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,475
Did I come to the right place?

115
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:20,015
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

116
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:29,425
( children chattering )

117
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:43,339
What if you took off
that bit there?

118
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:49,078
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

119
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:53,014
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

120
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:58,186
I want you to take it off.

121
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,990
( tsks )

122
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,360
Mouth.

123
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,931
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

124
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,134
Podrick: Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

125
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,005
I didn't hear that.

126
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,040
- Apologies, ser.
- Bronn: <i>Back away.</i>

127
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:24,010
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

128
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:27,680
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

129
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,683
I will murder you, boy.

130
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,185
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

131
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:50,000
<i>( knocking )</i>

132
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,203
- Pod?
- Cersei: <i>It's your sister.</i>

133
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:56,808
<i>The queen.</i>

134
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,857
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

135
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,060
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

136
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:16,929
No, I don't think so.

137
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:18,665
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

138
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,367
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

139
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,875
They stay outside.

140
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,144
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

141
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,562
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

142
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,167
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

143
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,637
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

144
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:59,040
I should hope so.

145
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:02,376
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

146
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,478
Thanks to Father.

147
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:06,981
Thanks to Father.

148
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,585
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

149
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,154
No? Curious.

150
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:16,991
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

151
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,227
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

152
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:22,230
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

153
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:25,567
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

154
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:27,368
You're meeting Father today?

155
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:29,471
How do you know that?

156
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,341
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

157
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,877
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

158
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,515
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

159
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,183
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

160
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:44,719
Do I need to want something?

161
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,389
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

162
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,124
as any father loves his child,

163
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,827
his baby boy.

164
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:55,929
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

165
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,597
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

166
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:00,733
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

167
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,303
but Father never came.

168
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,876
You're going to make me cry.

169
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,278
Why do you care
what I want from him?

170
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,782
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

171
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:19,050
Slandered?
When?

172
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,319
<i>You told him I had my guards</i>

173
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:23,220
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

174
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:25,089
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

175
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,357
A girl of nine, I believe.

176
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,192
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

177
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:30,260
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

178
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,695
If I remember correctly,

179
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,964
she never stole
a necklace again.

180
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:38,569
It's not slander if it's true.

181
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:41,305
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

182
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,073
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

183
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:45,342
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

184
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,444
Because you're a liar.

185
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,548
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

186
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:53,051
Any lies in particular?

187
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:57,222
You're a clever man,

188
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,525
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

189
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,595
Still makes me
more clever than you.

190
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:04,496
<i>( door opens )</i>

191
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,402
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

192
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,905
Ser Taryn Mant and...

193
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,674
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

194
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,075
Ser Meryn Trant.

195
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,645
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

196
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:21,281
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

197
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:22,749
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater

198
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,684
was anointed
by the king himself.

199
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,420
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

200
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:29,056
nothing more.

201
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,025
That's exactly who I am.

202
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,826
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

203
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:36,130
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

204
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,933
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

205
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,803
You put your hand on that door,

206
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:44,439
you lose the hand.

207
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,957
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

208
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:05,126
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

209
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,261
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

210
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,595
You're here to protect me.

211
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,831
I've been doing that
for a while now.

212
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,633
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

213
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,134
I grow poor protecting you.

214
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:16,069
Poor?
Poor?

215
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,171
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

216
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,273
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

217
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,043
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

218
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,145
And now my pockets are empty.

219
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,514
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

220
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:29,550
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

221
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:30,918
you'll need to pay more.

222
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,420
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

223
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:36,223
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

224
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,024
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

225
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,492
- How much?
- Double.

226
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,694
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

227
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,162
Knights are worth double.

228
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,565
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

229
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,667
Which means you can afford it.

230
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:54,107
- ( breathing heavily )
- <i>( waves lapping )</i>

231
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,648
( seabirds calling )

232
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,239
Here. Here!

233
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,051
Help me!

234
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:52,466
<i>( horn blowing )</i>

235
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,010
Who are you?

236
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:09,751
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

237
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,790
I was a captain and a knight.

238
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:18,694
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

239
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:27,037
The one true king
of Westeros--

240
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:31,741
Stannis Baratheon.

241
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:42,918
I thought you were dead.

242
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:45,587
Everyone thought you were dead.

243
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,159
And your son?

244
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:59,334
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

245
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,404
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

246
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:15,149
I'm so sorry, my friend.

247
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:17,719
I, too, have lost a son.

248
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,121
There is nothing worse
in this world.

249
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,025
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

250
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,595
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

251
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,199
Stannis lives?

252
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,435
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

253
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:37,236
Will you take me there?

254
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,672
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

255
00:21:39,707 --> 00:21:41,173
This war is not over.

256
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,541
Not for you, maybe.

257
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:45,311
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

258
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,346
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

259
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,849
I am sworn to no man.

260
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:53,686
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

261
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,221
I delivered the ships.

262
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:57,424
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

263
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,860
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

264
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:02,363
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

265
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:04,032
They say he sees no one--

266
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:06,301
not his generals,
not even his wife.

267
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:09,338
Only the Red Woman

268
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:10,739
whispering in his ear,

269
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:13,608
telling him what
she sees in the flames

270
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:15,277
and burning men alive.

271
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:16,745
What?

272
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,282
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

273
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:23,218
All those who spoke
against her she called

274
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:25,854
servants of darkness.

275
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:30,358
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

276
00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:36,665
I'm a pirate.

277
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

278
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:40,702
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

279
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:44,005
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

280
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,306
Take me back there, please.

281
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,241
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

282
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,910
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

283
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:52,545
You could try.

284
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,948
If you fail,
they will burn you.

285
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,851
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

286
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:00,020
And you've only
just come back to life.

287
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:02,289
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

288
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:05,058
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

289
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,560
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

290
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,496
but I don't ask you for favors.

291
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,131
I have to stop her.

292
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:14,301
Please, do this for me.

293
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:19,507
When you are dead,

294
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,976
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

295
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,113
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

296
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:41,329
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

297
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:44,132
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

298
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,667
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

299
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:47,568
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

300
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,771
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

301
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,507
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

302
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:55,344
I don't think
we're going to get one.

303
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,757
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

304
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:47,665
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

305
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:50,736
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

306
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,572
For them and for your sons.

307
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,774
Will it?

308
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,142
They rot in the ground

309
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,378
<i>while their killer runs free.</i>

310
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:03,347
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

311
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:06,217
My best hunters are after him.

312
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,873
- Robb: <i>A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

313
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:31,442
My father's bannerman.

314
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:54,666
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

315
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,380
Talisa:
<i>She's your mother.</i>

316
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:11,049
She freed Jaime Lannister.

317
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,452
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

318
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:15,254
and she robbed them
of their justice.

319
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:17,289
( coughing )

320
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:18,557
<i>Water.</i>

321
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,394
Water.

322
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,663
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

323
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:31,405
What's your name, friend?

324
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,306
Qyburn.

325
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,708
You're lucky to be alive.

326
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:40,447
Lucky?

327
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:43,050
<i>( birds cawing )</i>

328
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:06,309
( sighs )

329
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,412
The badge looks good on you.

330
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:12,883
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

331
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:18,255
Are you enjoying
your new position?

332
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:21,425
Am I enjoying it?

333
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,861
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

334
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:25,929
( chuckles ) Yes.

335
00:27:25,963 --> 00:27:27,931
I heard how happy you were.

336
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:29,833
( blows )

337
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:32,435
You brought a whore
into my bed.

338
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:35,071
It wasn't your bed at the time.

339
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:40,443
I sent you here
to advise the king.

340
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:44,513
I gave you real power
and authority.

341
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:46,882
You chose to spend your days

342
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,084
as you always have,

343
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:51,553
bedding harlots

344
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,955
and drinking with thieves.

345
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,485
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

346
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,682
What do you want, Tyrion?

347
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,732
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

348
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,668
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

349
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:10,305
My beloved father who

350
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:13,861
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

351
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:15,334
after he fell
on the battlefield.

352
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:18,938
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

353
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:21,974
I organized
the defense of this city

354
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:25,177
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

355
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:27,945
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

356
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,248
while your grandson, the king,

357
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:32,917
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

358
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:36,554
I bled in the mud
for our family.

359
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,057
And as my reward,

360
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:42,427
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

361
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:44,462
But what do I want?

362
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:47,932
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

363
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:51,202
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

364
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:53,672
You are a Lannister.

365
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,741
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

366
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,478
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

367
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:01,479
Hmm?

368
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:05,316
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

369
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:07,718
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

370
00:29:07,753 --> 00:29:12,523
So tell me what you want.

371
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:19,231
I want what is mine by right.

372
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:24,270
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

373
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:28,609
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

374
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,678
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

375
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:34,481
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

376
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:37,584
I am your son and lawful heir.

377
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:42,189
You want Casterly Rock?

378
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:44,191
It is mine by right.

379
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:48,730
( sighs )

380
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:50,865
We'll find you accommodations

381
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,801
more suited to your name

382
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,203
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

383
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:58,106
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

384
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,810
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

385
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,511
<i>fit for your talents</i>

386
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:06,081
so that you can
serve your family

387
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:08,216
and protect our legacy.

388
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:09,885
<i>And if you serve faithfully,</i>

389
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,454
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

390
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:16,324
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

391
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:17,626
<i>before mocking the family name</i>

392
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,596
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

393
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:24,999
- Why?
- Why?

394
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,168
You ask that?

395
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:30,604
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

396
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:34,775
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

397
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:38,813
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

398
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:41,415
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

399
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,053
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

400
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,124
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

401
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:53,560
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

402
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:57,498
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

403
00:30:57,532 --> 00:30:59,233
But neither gods nor men

404
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:02,169
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

405
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:05,305
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

406
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,208
Go, now.

407
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:15,115
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

408
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:19,319
Go.

409
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:30,429
Oh, one more thing.

410
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,968
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

411
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:46,714
Sansa: <i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

412
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:49,650
- Shae: <i>Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

413
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:53,154
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

414
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,526
But it's not coming back.

415
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:02,162
The captain's tired
of risking his life

416
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:04,365
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

417
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,468
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

418
00:32:08,837 --> 00:32:11,039
He's going to stay in Dorne.

419
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:14,409
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

420
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:18,213
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

421
00:32:18,248 --> 00:32:20,216
Don't ruin the game.

422
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,986
I told you,
I don't want to play.

423
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:26,122
What about that one there?

424
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,624
That one?

425
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:29,660
It's going to Volantis.

426
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,128
Why?

427
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:32,863
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

428
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:35,432
it looked like that one.

429
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,268
That's not how the game works.

430
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:40,872
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

431
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:42,506
You've got to invent a story

432
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:45,976
about where the ship
is going and why.

433
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:48,880
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

434
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:50,948
Because the truth

435
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:53,518
is always either
terrible or boring.

436
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:56,321
Lovely day for it.

437
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:58,257
Watching the ships.

438
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:01,260
Lord Baelish.

439
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:04,330
Might I speak with Lady Sansa

440
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:05,999
alone for a moment?

441
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,346
I saw your mother not long ago.

442
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:24,049
She's very eager to see you.

443
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:29,120
And your sister.

444
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:31,757
Arya's alive?

445
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:36,928
You said you'd take me home.

446
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:40,331
You said King's Landing
was your home.

447
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:42,900
You are the property
of the crown.

448
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,301
Stealing you would be treason.

449
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:46,570
If you were to tell
just one person--

450
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,606
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

451
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,574
Because I'm a terrible liar.

452
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:53,243
You said so yourself.

453
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:56,446
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

454
00:33:59,683 --> 00:34:01,217
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

455
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:04,453
that will take me far away
from the capital.

456
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,188
When I set sail,

457
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:08,757
I might be able
to take you with me.

458
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,793
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

459
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,498
You're her handmaiden?

460
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,370
Yes.
And you're his...?

461
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:24,874
I help manage his affairs.

462
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:28,311
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

463
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,879
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

464
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:32,915
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

465
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,351
from sunrise till sunset.

466
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:40,356
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

467
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,694
Yes.

468
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:47,964
Given where we started.

469
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:50,233
And where is that?

470
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:53,769
It's not easy for girls like us

471
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:55,972
to dig our way out.

472
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:03,345
Ros:
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

473
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,214
I always do.

474
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:08,950
Watch out for her with him.

475
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:25,536
<i>( dragon screeching )</i>

476
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,510
( screeches )

477
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,515
( screeches )

478
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,488
( screeching )

479
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,341
They're growing fast.

480
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,078
Not fast enough.

481
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,516
I can't wait that long.

482
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,388
I need an army.

483
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:17,722
<i>( dragon screeching )</i>

484
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:20,191
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

485
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:24,262
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

486
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:27,099
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

487
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,435
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

488
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:31,303
Do those people
have any better ideas

489
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:34,606
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

490
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:38,143
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

491
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:40,278
<i>( man vomiting )</i>

492
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:43,481
You're right.

493
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,686
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

494
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,487
Daenerys:
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

495
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,890
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

496
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,292
They followed me
across the poison water.

497
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:56,627
If they'll do it, others will.

498
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:58,194
And with a true
khalasar--

499
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:02,332
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

500
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:06,135
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

501
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,371
And not before.

502
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:15,177
<i>( seabirds calling )</i>

503
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,199
Your Grace.

504
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:50,781
I heard you were dead.

505
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:52,683
Not yet.

506
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:57,688
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

507
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:00,758
We are alone.

508
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,939
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

509
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:16,842
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

510
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:19,845
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

511
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:22,181
And there is still
a war to fight.

512
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:24,916
I am fighting.

513
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:27,586
By burning prisoners alive?

514
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,657
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

515
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:34,127
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

516
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,262
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

517
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:39,031
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

518
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:41,767
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

519
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:48,107
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

520
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,911
<i>Did I set your ships ablaze?</i>

521
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,553
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

522
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:04,225
I could have saved those men.

523
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,893
You would have taken the city,

524
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:07,802
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

525
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,498
and you would stand beside him.

526
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:12,067
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

527
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:15,771
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

528
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,982
Do you hear them screaming?

529
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:30,319
All those burning men
in the water

530
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:33,021
crying for their mothers,

531
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,924
for their gods for help?

532
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,693
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

533
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,331
( gasps )

534
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:47,968
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

535
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,370
What I told your son is true.

536
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:52,772
Death by fire

537
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,508
is the purest death.

538
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,377
( growls )

539
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,645
This woman is evil!

540
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:00,736
She's the mother of demons.

541
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,003
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

542
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,494
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

543
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:06,442
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

544
00:40:06,476 --> 00:40:09,344
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

545
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:11,380
Davos:
<i>Your Grace!</i>

546
00:40:11,414 --> 00:40:12,915
<i>( door closes )</i>

547
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:15,851
( guards shouting )

548
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:41,443
Guard:
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

549
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:45,514
Guard #2:
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

550
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:52,598
Why have we stopped?

551
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:54,557
It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

552
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:01,731
Joffrey: <i>What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?</i>

553
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:05,668
Maid: My lady. We should
have guards, my lady.

554
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:08,071
Why?

555
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:12,976
Pardon me.

556
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:23,421
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

557
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:25,256
I have others.

558
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:33,464
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

559
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:38,151
No.

560
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:40,504
He was a soldier.

561
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,439
He went to fight on the walls

562
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:45,042
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

563
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:47,144
He never came back.

564
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:48,979
And your mother?

565
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:51,414
She died when she had me.

566
00:41:53,985 --> 00:41:56,253
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

567
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:59,956
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

568
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:07,965
Whenever you look
at this knight,

569
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,834
I want you to remember
your father.

570
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,304
He wasn't a knight.

571
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:17,001
He was just a soldier.

572
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:19,675
And what do knights
swear to do?

573
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:23,044
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

574
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,814
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

575
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:32,720
Was your father a soldier, too?

576
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:36,657
You should be proud, too.

577
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:40,828
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

578
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:43,597
your fathers saved the city.

579
00:42:43,632 --> 00:42:45,933
They saved us all.

580
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:49,337
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

581
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,774
All of you.

582
00:42:55,177 --> 00:42:57,478
( children laughing )

583
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,582
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

584
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:04,684
clothe them, or house them.

585
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:08,587
Directly to me.

586
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:21,333
<i>( doors open )</i>

587
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:25,504
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

588
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,139
Please, sit.
Sit.

589
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:29,642
I do apologize, my lady.

590
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:32,012
Small council meetings.

591
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:34,147
At what point
does it become treason

592
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:36,049
to waste the king's time?

593
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,386
( laughs )

594
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:42,490
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

595
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:44,526
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

596
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,962
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

597
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:50,366
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

598
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,102
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

599
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:56,605
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

600
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,842
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

601
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:01,844
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

602
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:04,981
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

603
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:07,883
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

604
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:09,552
I've never seen
anything like it.

605
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:11,487
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

606
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:14,123
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

607
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:17,960
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

608
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:19,762
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

609
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:24,166
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

610
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,734
the High Septon told me about.

611
00:44:25,768 --> 00:44:28,437
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

612
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:32,775
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

613
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:35,078
and approach them
with an open heart.

614
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:37,180
Cersei: <i>An open heart is what
you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

615
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:38,781
<i>if you're not careful, my dear.</i>

616
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:42,651
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

617
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,621
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

618
00:44:45,655 --> 00:44:48,624
The king barely escaped
with his life.

619
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:52,128
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

620
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:54,731
Facts become less and less
important to her

621
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:56,766
<i>as she grows older.</i>

622
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:59,736
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

623
00:45:00,971 --> 00:45:02,705
You're right, of course.

624
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,975
But you are your father's son.

625
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,177
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

626
00:45:16,354 --> 00:45:18,555
Hunger turns men into beasts.

627
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:22,426
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

628
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:26,297
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

629
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:29,834
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

630
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,537
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

631
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:34,606
in time of need.

632
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,341
Well, as Ser Loras said,

633
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,511
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

634
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:42,231
charitable work before.

635
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,649
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

636
00:45:46,018 --> 00:45:48,053
I'm sure she does.

637
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:07,238
( speaking Valyrian )

638
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:19,207
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

639
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:21,473
with no food or water.

640
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:24,543
( speaking Valyrian )

641
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:29,982
They will stand
until they drop.

642
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:31,652
( speaking Valyrian )

643
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:34,219
Such is their obedience.

644
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,059
They may suit my needs.

645
00:46:38,093 --> 00:46:40,061
Tell me of their training.

646
00:46:40,095 --> 00:46:42,737
_

647
00:46:42,857 --> 00:46:46,831
_

648
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:50,527
_

649
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,242
_

650
00:46:54,888 --> 00:46:57,820
_

651
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,790
_

652
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,175
They begin their
training at five.

653
00:47:02,678 --> 00:47:04,646
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

654
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:06,849
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

655
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:09,284
the shield,
and the three spears.

656
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:12,922
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

657
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:15,091
( speaking Valyrian )

658
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:18,994
Missandei: <i>Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.</i>

659
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:20,796
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

660
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,865
Even the bravest men
fear death.

661
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,370
_

662
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,119
_

663
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:35,805
_

664
00:47:35,925 --> 00:47:40,148
_

665
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:44,987
( continues in Valyrian )

666
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:47,990
Missandei: <i>My master says
the Unsullied are not men.</i>

667
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:50,392
Death means nothing to them.

668
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:55,225
_

669
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,396
_

670
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:01,869
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

671
00:48:04,606 --> 00:48:06,874
( speaking Valyrian )

672
00:48:16,517 --> 00:48:18,852
Tell the good master
there is no need.

673
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:22,458
_

674
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:24,577
_

675
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:26,174
_

676
00:48:26,294 --> 00:48:29,262
Missandei: <i>My master points out
that men don't need nipples.</i>

677
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:34,936
_

678
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:37,470
_

679
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:45,594
( speaking Valyrian )

680
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,248
To win his shield,

681
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:51,018
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

682
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:56,023
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

683
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,794
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

684
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:02,930
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

685
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:07,068
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

686
00:49:07,102 --> 00:49:11,405
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

687
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,131
( speaking Valyrian )

688
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,874
_

689
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,331
_

690
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:22,018
_

691
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:25,286
( continues in Valyrian )

692
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,921
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

693
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:30,524
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

694
00:49:36,665 --> 00:49:38,632
How many do you have to sell?

695
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,536
<i>( Missandei speaking Valyrian )</i>

696
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:45,640
8,000.

697
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,278
_

698
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,216
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

699
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,085
Many other buyers
are interested.

700
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:09,398
8,000 dead babies.

701
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:12,001
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

702
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:14,370
Once I own them,
these men--

703
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:16,939
They're not men.
Not anymore.

704
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:20,342
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

705
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,444
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

706
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:25,914
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

707
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:41,128
You'll be fair to them.

708
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,931
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

709
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,705
You won't order them
to murder babies.

710
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,575
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

711
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:56,444
A great injustice
has been done to them.

712
00:50:57,614 --> 00:51:00,148
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

713
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:14,029
( grunts )

714
00:51:16,065 --> 00:51:19,201
( chittering )

715
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:37,251
( hisses )

716
00:51:56,937 --> 00:51:58,872
The warlocks.

717
00:52:02,344 --> 00:52:05,213
I owe you my life, ser.

718
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,882
The honor is mine,

719
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,117
my queen.

720
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:14,756
You know this man?

721
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,591
I know him

722
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:21,096
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

723
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,698
and as the Lord Commander

724
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:25,500
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

725
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:28,971
King Robert is dead.

726
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:31,874
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

727
00:52:31,908 --> 00:52:34,443
to ask your forgiveness.

728
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:37,513
I was sworn to protect
your family.

729
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:41,183
I failed them.

730
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,858
I am Barristan Selmy,

731
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:51,194
Kingsguard to your father.

732
00:52:51,228 --> 00:52:53,629
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

733
00:52:53,664 --> 00:52:56,733
and I will not fail you again.

734
