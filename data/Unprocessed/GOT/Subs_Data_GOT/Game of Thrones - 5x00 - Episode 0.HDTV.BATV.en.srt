1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,690
<i>Although this is TV,</i>

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,110
<i>it's TV in a scale that</i>
<i>is beyond anything else.</i>

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,034
<i>It's the most
successful TV show in the world right now.</i>

4
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,204
<i>It is special.</i>
<i>Very, very special.</i>

5
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,960
<i>Today we're
shooting in Croatia,</i>

6
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,745
<i>they're shooting in Belfast,</i>

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,549
<i>and they're preparing for shooting
in Seville down in Spain.</i>

8
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,101
<i>Whatever hand you're dealt,</i>
<i>you have to go with it</i>

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,187
<i>because the show can't stop.</i>

10
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,458
<i>I think we're
the only ones in the world</i>

11
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,226
<i>that shoot with two units</i>

12
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:05,396
<i>at the same time</i>
<i>all season long.</i>

13
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,965
<i>If one of those spokes</i>
<i>in the wheel are missing,</i>

14
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,867
<i>it's gonna collapse.</i>

15
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,620
<i>And, action!</i>

16
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:26,274
Game of Thrones - 05x00 - A Day in the Life
Air Date 02/09/2015

17
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,210
Morning.

18
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,829
How are you all?

19
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:42,166
<i>My name is Duncan Muggoch</i>
<i>and I'm the UK line producer</i>

20
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,502
<i>for Croatia and Spain,</i>
<i>or what we also call</i>

21
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:48,422
<i>the southern locations for
"Game of Thrones" season five.</i>

22
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:51,342
<i>This is my second season.</i>
<i>I did Croatia last year.</i>

23
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,011
And this year we've obviously got
Spain thrown into it as well.

24
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,147
So I'm line producing
both of them this year.

25
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,266
And even though last year was
big, this one's even bigger.

26
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,692
<i>My name is Chris Newman.</i>
<i>I'm one of the producers on "Game of Thrones."</i>

27
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,362
I fulfill a function here of
planning how the two units work

28
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:14,999
<i>and drift in between the sets, the
locations, and the different countries.</i>

29
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,701
So how was yesterday?
All right?

30
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,537
- Yes. Yeah, it was good.
It was really good, yeah. - Yes? Good.

31
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,455
<i>We start shooting
at the end of July.</i>

32
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:24,208
99% of the crew
have been here before.

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,544
<i>So when you start day one,</i>

34
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,096
<i>it feels like day 301</i>

35
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,715
<i>in a good way.</i>

36
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,184
As this is going on here,
over in Spain

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,720
we have Peter
who runs Fresco Films.

38
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:39,523
He's new to this year, so he doesn't
know quite how manic it can get.

39
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,230
<i>My name is Peter Welter Soler.</i>

40
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,912
I'm the Spanish line producer
on this show.

41
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,067
The production booklets,
are we getting them tonight?

42
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,037
<i>We have two weeks
left before everybody arrives.</i>

43
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,239
<i>And then two days later,</i>
<i>we start shooting.</i>

44
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,743
<i>I'd be lying if I said the
stress level is not increasing,</i>

45
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:01,378
<i>because obviously this is
very important for all of us.</i>

46
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,655
<i>Doing it for the first time,</i>
<i>we want to please everybody.</i>

47
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,082
<i>We want to do a great job.</i>

48
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:08,252
This is actually maybe not
the calm before the storm.

49
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,888
It is the rehearsal before the show.

50
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:23,684
We're heading from our unit base
into Dubrovnik, into the old town.

51
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,854
<i>Filming here is quite different
from filming in Belfast</i>

52
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,273
<i>'cause the logistics over here</i>
<i>are very different.</i>

53
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,442
<i>One of the logistical</i>
<i>problems of Dubrovnik</i>

54
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,861
<i>is it's such a tight,</i>
<i>small, old city</i>

55
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,781
<i>that we can't get our big
vehicles actually into the town</i>

56
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,282
<i>just 'cause the streets</i>
<i>are so narrow.</i>

57
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,004
<i>It's just one of the
challenges that we face</i>

58
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,952
filming in a city like this.

59
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,546
<i>You can't take vehicles</i>
<i>within the old walls,</i>

60
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:55,466
<i>so everything has</i>
<i>to get taken by Sherpas</i>

61
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,135
<i>up to a location today</i>
<i>which is probably</i>

62
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,338
<i>one of the furthest and trickiest
you could get to in the whole city.</i>

63
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,224
A little rule that I have
for myself on location,

64
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,976
and this is never go up empty-handed
or come down empty-handed.

65
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,263
<i>Now it's just a load of stairs</i>
<i>all the way up to the top.</i>

66
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,148
Hello, gorgeous.

67
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,650
Good. Good, good.

68
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,685
<i>The principal actors
are just arriving on set</i>

69
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:17,354
<i>to rehearse.</i>

70
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,607
<i>They will do a rehearsal</i>
<i>with the director first,</i>

71
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,775
<i>and then they'll do</i>
<i>a full crew rehearsal,</i>

72
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,862
<i>which is when they'll place where the cameras
are gonna go and everything like that.</i>

73
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:28,115
<i>Okay, guys, give
us the set, please.</i>

74
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,259
Hey, Joseph. How are you?
Nice to see you.

75
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,511
<i>Episode one and
two have been in Croatia.</i>

76
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,097
They've done most of their filming
and they're back here finishing up

77
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,799
now that Emilia
has finished in Croatia.

78
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,137
Do that. Just growl at one point.

79
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,858
So this morning, episode one and
two with Mike Slovis directing

80
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,895
are setting up to do their first scene
this season in Dany's penthouse.

81
00:04:57,947 --> 00:05:00,314
Morning, everybody.
Hello.

82
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,817
<i>So it's right at the
beginning of the-- season five</i>

83
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,453
and it's the first time
Dany gets an inkling

84
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,406
of what's going on in Meereen
under her new rule.

85
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,825
And then do you want it
to be a boom,

86
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,662
I've decided
I will not have them?

87
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,247
Or do you want it
to be kind of like--

88
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,882
- No, I think it's more gentle.
- It's gentle?

89
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,583
It is gentle?
Okay, lovely. Yeah.

90
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:21,752
I have shot mostly in Belfast.

91
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,922
I have shot several days
in Croatia

92
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,591
and I am going to shoot
in Seville.

93
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,426
Teach them a better way.

94
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,095
It sounds like something
Jorah would have said.

95
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,264
<i>Moving to a foreign
country on this show</i>

96
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,016
is not as disruptive
as you might think

97
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,102
because one of the two crews

98
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,322
that you've already
worked with here goes there.

99
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:43,357
<i>So the first thing that happens</i>
<i>when you walk on the set</i>

100
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,942
<i>is that you see familiar faces.</i>

101
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:48,362
<i>My priority today
is looking after Emilia</i>

102
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,281
because she's come from Croatia,

103
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,950
so we're matching continuity
to that country.

104
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,919
<i>They send their photos to us</i>

105
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,454
<i>so that we can do the same</i>
<i>as they've been doing.</i>

106
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,757
<i>There's two
departments filming at the same time,</i>

107
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,592
so it's imperative
that things like wigs,

108
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,129
continuity photos
all travel together

109
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,132
and that every member of the team
is aware of what the look is,

110
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,301
<i>because if we do have to
take over someone's artist,</i>

111
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:13,304
we know exactly what we're
doing and there's no mess-ups

112
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,389
when we're watching
the show, hopefully.

113
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,107
<i>Let's do one
for camera, please.</i>

114
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,776
Okay.

115
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,145
<i>Let's have it quiet
for rehearsal, please.</i>

116
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,731
<i>And that means everybody</i>
<i>in here, thank you.</i>

117
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,115
<i>Action.</i>

118
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,650
So the only thing
that gave him pride

119
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,153
was knowing there was
someone lower than he was.

120
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,299
- Morning.
- Morning.

121
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,684
- How are you?
- Good.

122
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,636
- Morning, Duncan. Morning, Mr. Muggoch.
- Morning.

123
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:49,540
Oh, I want to talk to Peter
today or maybe you can.

124
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,809
Peter Welter?
Yeah, no, I'm talking with him.

125
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,894
About Crdoba bridge
and the drone.

126
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,146
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
Bernie is "Game of Thrones."</i>

127
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:59,283
I've never met a producer that cares
for a crew as much as she does.

128
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,069
She's an incredible woman
to work for, actually,

129
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,654
and everybody loves her.

130
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,027
<i>And she keeps</i>
<i>everything together.</i>

131
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,824
And do they want to
clear a place in that?

132
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,409
So the bridge has to be closed.

133
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,910
That's--
I'm checking on.

134
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,246
Along with David and Dan,
she's the executive producer.

135
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,631
David and Dan are obviously-- you
know, they're the creators of it.

136
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,833
<i>It's their baby.</i>

137
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,501
<i>Bernie is the one that keeps</i>
<i>this show running.</i>

138
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:20,170
Sometimes David and Dan
will be with us.

139
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,340
<i>Sometimes they are separate so
that they can both be on the set,</i>

140
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:25,642
<i>depending</i>
<i>what the scene might be,</i>

141
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,429
will watch rehearsal,
give their notes on the scene,

142
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,065
and then a lot of times we're
discussing what is in advance.

143
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,983
As you can imagine,
with 10 episodes,

144
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,535
that we're constantly prepping.

145
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:39,256
Much like our characters, we
will go from the amazing Daznak

146
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,091
right into the amazing Hardhome.

147
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,043
<i>I usually have a
nice list for them every day.</i>

148
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,597
They almost cringe when they see
me starting to come towards them

149
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,216
and open my book to start
asking my questions.

150
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:53,270
<i>But they're fantastically</i>
<i>collaborative with all of us.</i>

151
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,607
Today, they're having a big
Hardhome meeting up in Belfast.

152
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,643
- They got the notes?
- Yes. Yeah.

153
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:02,146
<i>When we're shooting
in different countries,</i>

154
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,947
<i>it's about a constant</i>
<i>communication</i>

155
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,483
<i>between the producers</i>
<i>in each country.</i>

156
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,653
I'm gonna follow Nutter
over to Spain early.

157
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:13,624
You're staying here
through Illyrio's, right?

158
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,042
Are we doing a charter
to Sevilla?

159
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,494
<i>We are, yes, but I'm going
to leave ahead of time.</i>

160
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,879
Yeah, which goes on the 8th.

161
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,497
I'll go on the charter
this time.

162
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,866
- Hope there's a seat for me.
- There'll be a seat for you.

163
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,002
You can have Bernie's seat.

164
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,705
In a week, we will all
take off in a charter

165
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:32,643
to go to Spain and that is now
starting to come very close.

166
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,778
<i>After they have</i>
<i>their big scout today,</i>

167
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,232
then we'll have more information
to go off of for that.

168
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,322
<i>We're in the
royal palaces of Seville</i>

169
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,991
<i>called the Real Alczar,</i>
<i>which are palaces built</i>

170
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,911
<i>by Peter the Horrible</i>
<i>in the 13th century.</i>

171
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,997
It's one of the most visited
monuments in Spain.

172
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:57,568
<i>The Alczar will be, like,</i>
<i>the water gardens of Dorne.</i>

173
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,737
<i>Since Dorne is a new world
that's just come into the show--</i>

174
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,206
<i>it was introduced</i>
<i>in the fourth season,</i>

175
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,724
<i>but we didn't</i>
<i>really see it--</i>

176
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,427
<i>now in the fifth season,</i>
<i>they will finally get to see</i>

177
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,178
<i>the Kingdom of Dorne.</i>

178
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,181
Good morning once again.

179
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,400
<i>It is difficult
to shoot in a place like that</i>

180
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,854
because it was obviously
not built as a set,

181
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,189
but built for a purpose,
a different purpose than ours.

182
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,580
Some of the places, as you see
in the balcony, for instance,

183
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:29,533
I mean, you can't possibly
get some of the gear up there

184
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,034
<i>because the staircase</i>
<i>is too narrow.</i>

185
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:32,619
<i>So we have to get</i>
<i>a crane in--</i>

186
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,204
<i>Genie Booms, cranes,</i>
<i>platforms--</i>

187
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,540
<i>in order to haul</i>
<i>that material up there.</i>

188
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,058
- It's tricky, you know?
- Okay.

189
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,644
<i>It's not like</i>
<i>a back lot studio shoot.</i>

190
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,730
First and second
shooting day is up here.

191
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,231
And then we move down
to the garden.

192
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,150
We'll get control of the
garden, I'm assuming?

193
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,904
As far as you told me, we have the
entire garden area for us, correct?

194
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,456
- Yes, I have this note here.
- It's pretty amazing.

195
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:12,993
<i> They have, like, an average
of 8,000 tourists in here every day.</i>

196
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:17,130
<i>To see it, like, empty and have it
just for us is just a privilege.</i>

197
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,917
Wherever you go, there's always
gonna be a challenge

198
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,920
because you're in a new place
both culturally and logistically.

199
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:24,505
We'll have to find a compromise

200
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,056
where we can work
together with the palace.

201
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,058
We're the foreigners
coming into their country,

202
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,426
trying to put
this project together.

203
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:31,812
<i>I have to say they're being</i>
<i>extremely nice,</i>

204
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,598
<i>which is-- so we need</i>
<i>to make sure that our--</i>

205
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,768
<i>which they always are--</i>
<i>but our crew are very careful</i>

206
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,521
in this delicate location.

207
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,606
*** And what they're
doing for us is unique as well.

208
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,858
It's never been locked off
like this for anybody.

209
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,443
All right, so will you go
and check the others?

210
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:49,413
- Sure. - Because I think
we're running a bit late now.

211
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,126
We're now driving up to a little
village called Magheramorne

212
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:07,464
in which there is a quarry that's
been there for a number of years now.

213
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,633
<i>And in season one</i>

214
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,135
<i>we built the set</i>
<i>of Castle Black there.</i>

215
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,804
<i>Because there's a lake</i>
<i>in the quarry,</i>

216
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,356
<i>in season two we built the
battlements of King's Landing</i>

217
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,975
<i>for the Battle of Blackwater</i>

218
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,977
<i>with Stannis's boats attacking.</i>

219
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,647
<i>It's still standing, although it's
looking a bit worn these days.</i>

220
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,484
Now we're driving up to have a
look at a set mid-construction

221
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,486
<i>of a fishing village</i>
<i>set north of the Wall.</i>

222
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:32,573
<i>We'll begin to see how that's
taking shape this morning.</i>

223
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,659
<i>The set that we see down here,</i>

224
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,629
<i>it's a fishing village that is
a protected fishing village.</i>

225
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,414
<i>It's not a military</i>
<i>establishment.</i>

226
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,133
It was designed to be
somewhere where people

227
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,885
had a living off the sea.

228
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,137
<i>So we needed the water,</i>
<i>which is why we put it</i>

229
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:49,806
<i>on the edge</i>
<i>of the reservoir here.</i>

230
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,808
The fantastic thing
about the Hardhome set

231
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,346
is we're building something
that is so far north this time

232
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,732
<i>that what we get to do</i>
<i>is create a fishing village</i>

233
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,851
<i>that is exactly</i>
<i>as the name describes.</i>

234
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,936
<i>It's Hardhome.</i>
<i>What we've been doing</i>

235
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,022
<i>both in concepts and in models</i>

236
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,692
<i>is looking at the location</i>
<i>out in Magheramorne</i>

237
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:10,661
and created what we need
for the action,

238
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,498
which is a longhouse in which
a lot of action takes place.

239
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,366
<i>And then we have</i>
<i>the landing area,</i>

240
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,369
<i>which we're able to use the lake
that exists in Magheramorne.</i>

241
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:23,507
And so through having those
sort of necessary requirements,

242
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,510
we can then build
this sort of tent city

243
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,462
<i>that will be created out there.</i>

244
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,714
So I had this good idea,

245
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,883
which I need to pitch, I guess,

246
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,053
which is to hold onto that shot.

247
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,389
<i>The director can
now see the bones of the whole set,</i>

248
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:42,809
<i>so he's gonna walk through</i>
<i>the set and start mapping out</i>

249
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,879
<i>where all the things that</i>
<i>he's imagined will take place.</i>

250
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,665
If the plan to do that shot--
it's the boater's point of view,

251
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,750
so it's looking
through the fence.

252
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,168
<i>So anything at this point</i>

253
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,220
<i>that the director</i>
<i>would like to change,</i>

254
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,472
<i>this is the time that he has</i>
<i>to turn around and say,</i>

255
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,724
<i>"Well, could I put the door</i>
<i>in the hut over here?"</i>

256
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,011
<i>and, "Could I have this</i>
<i>a bit higher?" or so on.</i>

257
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,547
Good, so, yeah,
we good with this?

258
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,316
- Yeah.
- Rock and roll, so...

259
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,232
- shall we have a look... - Look at this edge
here and see if that works.

260
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,038
<i>"Game of
Thrones" is a big event,</i>

261
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,622
and what you mustn't do

262
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:16,293
is get put off
by the bigness of it.

263
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,845
The thing to do
is to come in and say,

264
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,964
"All I've got to worry about
is the 16x9.

265
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:24,217
What's in that frame."
It must be like parachuting.

266
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,269
Don't worry about
the height you're jumping,

267
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,305
just make sure
the parachute works.

268
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,864
It doesn't have to be a sparrow.

269
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,735
<i>Today we've got
about 128 extras out</i>

270
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,370
and then everything
that goes with that,

271
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,572
which is the extra hair people,
makeup people,

272
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,657
<i>costume people that have</i>
<i>to deal with all of that.</i>

273
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,410
<i>Crowds start dressing
about 5:00 this morning.</i>

274
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,163
<i>And then just in conjunction</i>
<i>with hair and makeup,</i>

275
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:54,831
we're just sort of working
around each other.

276
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,134
And then everybody
travelled to set about 7:30

277
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,335
to be all set for 8:00.

278
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,170
Just need to take
your blankets off, guys,

279
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,172
<i>so we can look</i>
<i>at your costumes, please.</i>

280
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,724
<i>Mark Mylod is the director,</i>

281
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,309
<i>and he's now going</i>
<i>to select the extras</i>

282
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,345
<i>that he wants to feature</i>
<i>in the scene.</i>

283
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:11,014
Yep, this gentleman.
And one other lady.

284
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,266
It changed a bit this morning
because people had to look

285
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,819
a bit poorer than
we'd originally intended.

286
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,905
I'd just like to maybe darken a
couple of teeth or something.

287
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,491
A bit of the teeth black, you
know, just one or two of those.

288
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,944
And maybe-- okay,
the skin's pretty good.

289
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,946
Just a little less healthy.

290
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,448
And so it was a bit of a
scramble trying to get everybody

291
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,368
broken down enough to look a
bit poorer than they had done.

292
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,702
<i>And it's still happening.</i>

293
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,635
People are still getting
dirtied up as we speak.

294
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,506
- Thank you, guys. Well done.
- Brilliant.

295
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,942
- Thank you. See you soon.
- Thank you.

296
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:43,880
We had more than
86,000 applications

297
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:47,184
to be a background extra
in the show.

298
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,554
People from
not only all over Spain,

299
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,105
but all over Europe,
even from California,

300
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,890
<i>from Argentina,</i>
<i>from South Africa,</i>

301
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,026
<i>wanting to come to the casting,</i>

302
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,061
<i>wanting to be part</i>
<i>of "Game of Thrones."</i>

303
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:00,947
- Hello.
- How are you?

304
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,866
- Good.
- Peter.<i> Buenos das.</i>

305
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,868
-<i> Buenos das.</i>
-<i> Buenas tardes.</i>

306
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,404
- Oh,<i> buenas tardes.</i>
-<i> Buenas tardes</i> is the afternoon.

307
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:09,456
Maybe you just got up.

308
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,074
I just had a<i> siesta.</i>

309
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,743
- Okay, then it's good morning again.
- Thank you.

310
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:16,580
There's gonna be about 1,000
costumes to do 600 extras.

311
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,665
<i>Because it's
such a major operation,</i>

312
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:22,085
<i>we're doing something like 50, 60
fittings a day, which normally we do 30.</i>

313
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,088
We fit everybody here,
males, females, in and out.

314
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,591
We do guards, slaves.
There's a rogue slave.

315
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,810
<i>There's a slave over there.
Hello, slave.</i>

316
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,511
<i>They process down here</i>

317
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,263
<i>and these guys put on the hair.</i>

318
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:36,433
<i>Jenny puts on makeup</i>
<i>and they do their magic.</i>

319
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,568
<i>We're moving around</i>
<i>very quickly.</i>

320
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,004
We're shooting in three
or four different places

321
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,672
all straight after each other.

322
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:46,426
But we, like, have to go in
advance and prep 600, 700 people

323
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:50,347
all ready for a camera
that moves behind us.

324
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,382
We're basically set here.

325
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,334
I like when things
are just smooth.

326
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,899
<i>We've got Lena Headey
and Jonathan Pryce today.</i>

327
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:12,285
We're shooting a scene here
from episode three

328
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,990
<i> which is a kind of</i>
<i> rundown area</i>,

329
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,575
<i>behind the Sept of Baelor.</i>

330
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,044
<i>And it's a scene</i>
<i>where Cersei is looking</i>

331
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,712
<i>to have a conversation</i>
<i>with the High Sparrow</i>

332
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,881
<i>who is a whole new character.</i>

333
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,249
We've got a beautiful courtyard

334
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,918
which is actually
a former convent.

335
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,421
And we are disguising it
with a lot of awnings

336
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,091
<i>and a lot of ground cover</i>
<i>on the floor.</i>

337
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:37,677
<i>And it's supposed to be</i>
<i>a really shocking place</i>

338
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,729
where Cersei encounters
the poverty

339
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,098
that she has managed to ignore
for most of her time

340
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,433
living in King's Landing.

341
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,602
I'm standing there
looking butch and macho.

342
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:48,572
- I do a lot of that.
<i>-  Can you show us?</i>

343
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,243
- That's it. That's it.
-<i> There's no...</i>

344
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,245
-<i> No jiggling?</i>
- No, that's it.

345
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,080
If I jiggle, I sound
like "Jingle Bells."

346
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,949
So I can't actually move.
I'm not allowed to move.

347
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,533
I have to stand still.

348
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,125
<i>From walking about,
we're in every street there is.</i>

349
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,961
It's only started
a few days ago,

350
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,129
so we haven't been here
long enough yet

351
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,882
to really cause chaos,
but it'll come.

352
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,135
Dubrovnik is understandably
a big tourist attraction,

353
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:22,305
<i>so you're normally fighting</i>
<i>through the crowds.</i>

354
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,691
<i>That's been a difficulty</i>
<i>on the sets.</i>

355
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,193
Rolling!
Nice and quiet.

356
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,315
-<i> Roll camera.</i>
-<i> Rolling!</i>

357
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,951
-<i> Rolling!</i>
-<i> Sound speed.</i>

358
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,654
17, take one, C marker only.

359
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,457
<i>And, action!</i>

360
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:45,712
I don't think this is
a good idea, Your Grace.

361
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:48,415
Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These
are deeply religious people.

362
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,500
Where can I find
the High Sparrow?

363
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,180
<i>- Cut. Cut.</i>
<i>- Cut!</i>

364
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,234
- Why did you do that?
- I don't believe you did that!

365
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,070
Are you all right?

366
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:12,155
- Wanker.
- That's it, we're on strike.

367
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,907
No, we're on strike.
Fuck you. Go on.

368
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:17,110
You get into the fucking pelican.
See how you like it.

369
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:22,248
No?

370
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,034
-<i> Cut.</i>
- You know what?

371
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,036
I can't even lift--
I can't lift my arm

372
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,537
- 'cause it's like a T-rex.
- Hit me, come on.

373
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,005
You think you're fucking tough?
Come on.

374
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,874
Come on, harder.
Come on, harder.

375
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:41,768
<i>Belfast remains the
heart of the whole thing.</i>

376
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:44,471
<i>It's a major city,</i>
<i>so we have all the things</i>

377
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,940
that a big film crew need.

378
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,559
<i>But, you know, you drive</i>
<i>20 minutes out of the city</i>

379
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,561
<i>and you're in the heart</i>
<i>of the countryside.</i>

380
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,947
<i>It helps with the ancient</i>
<i>feel of the show</i>

381
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,566
<i>that the landscape has</i>
<i>a feeling of being old.</i>

382
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,035
<i>It's been worn down and eroded.</i>

383
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,489
<i>And everything has that ancient
feel to it no matter where you go.</i>

384
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,909
You know, the woods feel old,
the cliff tops feel old,

385
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,496
and the moorlands certainly
look old, you know.

386
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,548
<i>I always like to go</i>
<i>to the set every day</i>

387
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,833
<i>because that's been my heart.</i>

388
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,586
<i>This is my 40th year</i>
<i>in the film business</i>

389
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,722
<i>and my heart has always</i>
<i>been in making a film.</i>

390
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,340
<i>I've always loved the set.</i>

391
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,509
You can always kind of tell
how the day is going

392
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,896
by the way Chris is standing and
looking at everyone around set.

393
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,434
<i>I have no idea. Some
of them look at my face</i>

394
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,756
<i>and think if it's looking very
long, we must be in trouble,</i>

395
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,155
but that's not the case.

396
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,490
I might be thinking about
something entirely different.

397
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,275
I always find him
very calm and very relaxed

398
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:42,328
given that he's producing
this massive, epic show.

399
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:45,582
<i>We shoot
this year 120 days.</i>

400
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:49,252
<i>But in those 120 days,</i>
<i>we do shoot two units,</i>

401
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,837
<i>so you double it.</i>

402
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:54,958
<i>You're effectively shooting</i>
<i>240 days of screen time.</i>

403
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:03,800
Today on set I'm mostly
concerned with the Valyrian.

404
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:06,019
We have a scene
with the Valyrian language in,

405
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:07,604
<i>so I'm looking after the actors</i>

406
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,856
<i>and making sure that they feel
comfortable with their lines.</i>

407
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,642
<i>'Cause some of the sounds are
quite tricky to get through.</i>

408
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,195
<i>All right, guys.
Here we go. Shooting.</i>

409
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,063
<i>Let's have it quiet.</i>

410
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:19,616
<i>Let's roll cameras, please.</i>

411
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,452
<i>Rolling.</i>

412
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,820
<i>Action.</i>

413
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,822
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

414
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,031
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

415
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,385
- Your Grace.
- And cut it.

416
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:42,772
Let's go one more time.
Hey, Sean, I think...

417
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:09,465
<i>Right now, we
are in a town called Osuna.</i>

418
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,901
<i>And it has this</i>
<i>beautiful old bull ring</i>

419
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:14,070
<i>and it's a national</i>
<i>monument as well.</i>

420
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,322
<i>When we walked</i>
<i>into this bull ring,</i>

421
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,124
it was just the place
they were looking for.

422
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,295
<i>The stone is quite similar to the
stone they have shot in Croatia.</i>

423
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,747
- Made some great progress.
- Yes.

424
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,550
<i>This does not
have to be a bull ring.</i>

425
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,219
<i>It needs to be something</i>
<i>completely different,</i>

426
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,555
<i>and that's why we need to
transform it into that place.</i>

427
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,476
<i>Building the balcony where the actors
are going to go to the ground.</i>

428
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,695
<i>We had to cover up</i>
<i>all the pillars.</i>

429
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,797
There will be a lot
of things added to that.

430
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,550
<i>We're shooting just one</i>
<i>single scene in here</i>

431
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,135
<i>and it's 12 days.</i>
<i>It's quite complex.</i>

432
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,689
<i>There's a lot of action happening
and we need that time.</i>

433
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:52,108
The pressure is so high
to meet the expectancies

434
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,360
of what is involved in there.

435
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,312
<i>It was just incredible.</i>

436
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,122
All right, ladies and gents,
thank you very much.

437
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,874
That's a wrap for today.

438
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,959
<i>Quiet down, people.</i>
<i>Listen, clear the cameras,</i>

439
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:11,878
<i>clear the lights, the equipment.</i>

440
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,549
<i>Here was a very stable,</i>

441
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,018
<i>interesting day</i>
<i>for the character Daenerys.</i>

442
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:22,388
And then, of course, we had the big
trip out to see the set of Hardhome

443
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,307
<i>and it did open up</i>
<i>a lot of questions</i>

444
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,227
<i>which will continue to be</i>
<i>looked at in weeks to come.</i>

445
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,779
You do the best you can, get
everything as ready as you can,

446
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,681
and then you cross your fingers.

447
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,952
<i>Today went very well.</i>

448
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,121
<i>We finished our work.</i>
<i>David and Dan were happy,</i>

449
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,323
<i>which is always</i>
<i>my goal of the day</i>

450
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,991
<i>when they come out with a smile.</i>

451
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,911
<i>Chris and I will talk</i>
<i>and compare notes.</i>

452
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:49,332
Another two days down. That's the
beauty of shooting two units every day.

453
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:51,417
It's the only job that can
live two days in one.

454
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:56,172
<i>At the moment, the
main thing I'm thinking about</i>

455
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:57,507
<i>is getting out of Croatia.</i>

456
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,309
<i>We've got a lot of stuff</i>
<i>to move to Spain,</i>

457
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,011
so that's where all my thought
is going at the moment.

458
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,148
And obviously trying to set up
Spain at the same time.

459
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,649
Yeah.

460
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,851
And getting through
every day of filming.

461
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:12,855
And knowing that
there's big scenes coming up.

462
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:14,941
- Yeah.
<i>-  So it doesn't stop?</i>

463
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,626
No, it doesn't stop, no.

464
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:21,831
<i>Every day there are
things that you don't expect.</i>

465
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,500
Not having shot with
any of the crew before

466
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,202
obviously increases
the stress level.

467
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,371
- Hello, Croatia.
<i>-  Hello, Spain.</i>

468
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,089
<i>So, how is it all going?</i>

469
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,509
<i>As much as the
shooting date is moving closer</i>

470
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,878
<i>and everybody is aware</i>
<i>more and more of the fact</i>

471
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,964
that we have less time,

472
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,849
yeah, stress level
is increasing.

473
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,634
Definitely.
Definitely.

474
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,696
<i>Production
arriving in the past 10 days</i>

475
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,114
<i>was actually very good.</i>

476
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,700
<i>There was a lot</i>
<i>of people rolling up.</i>

477
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,620
<i>There's probably 450 people</i>
<i>working behind the camera.</i>

478
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:02,405
<i>All right, let's
roll cameras, please.</i>

479
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:04,240
<i>- Rolling!</i>
<i>- Let's roll camera!</i>

480
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,777
<i> And background action.</i>

481
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,079
<i>The first day of
shooting is always crucial to us</i>

482
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,215
<i>because it shows us</i>
<i>if everything we did</i>

483
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,335
in order to prepare it
was the right thing.

484
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,476
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

485
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,412
<i>And, action!</i>

486
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:48,584
This year, Belfast has got
some big sets like Hardhome

487
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:51,671
<i>and the art department and construction
have done a really great job</i>

488
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:55,007
<i>of turning what was a notion</i>
<i>into reality.</i>

9999
