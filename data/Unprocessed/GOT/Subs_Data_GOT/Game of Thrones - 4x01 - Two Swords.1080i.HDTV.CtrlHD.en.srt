1
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,580
- Magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.

2
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,782
Looks fresh-forged.

3
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,217
It is.

4
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,337
No one's made a Valyrian
steel sword

5
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,955
since the Doom of Valyria.

6
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,673
There are three living smiths

7
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,892
who know how to rework
Valyrian steel.

8
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,478
The finest of them
was in Volantis.

9
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:06,515
Came here to King's Landing
at my invitation.

10
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,767
Where did you get
this much Valyrian steel?

11
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,520
From someone who no longer
had need of it.

12
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,825
You've wanted one of these
in the family for a long time.

13
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,777
- And now we have two.
- Two?

14
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,329
The original weapon
was absurdly large.

15
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,732
Plenty of steel for two swords.

16
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:26,802
Well, thank you.
It's glorious.

17
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,676
You'll have to train
your left hand.

18
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,212
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

19
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,297
You'll never be as good.

20
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,016
No.

21
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,810
But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,

22
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,502
I suppose it doesn't matter.

23
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,739
You can't serve in the
Kingsguard with one hand.

24
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,108
Where's that written?
I can and I will.

25
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,309
The Kingsguard oath
is for life.

26
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,478
The war is over.
The king is safe.

27
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,230
The king is never safe.

28
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,783
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

29
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,235
Other knights protected the
king while you were a prisoner.

30
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:03,188
They will continue
to do so when you go home.

31
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,691
- Home?
- You'll return to Casterly Rock

32
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,994
<i>and rule in my stead.</i>

33
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,163
You are the Lord
of Casterly Rock.

34
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,867
I am the King's Hand.
My place is here.

35
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:19,421
I don't expect to see
the Rock again before I die.

36
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,007
You know what they call me?

37
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,309
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.

38
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,977
Man without honor.

39
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,647
Now you want me to break
another sacred vow.

40
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,233
You won't be breaking anything.

41
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,319
There is a precedent to relieve
a Kingsguard of his duties.

42
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,422
The king will exercise
that prerogative.

43
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,025
- No.
- No?

44
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,860
No.

45
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,530
I don't believe
I asked you a question.

46
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:48,083
- There's my answer.
- If you think your bloody honor comes before...

47
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,202
My bloody honor
is beyond repair,

48
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,871
but my answer is still no.
I don't want Casterly Rock.

49
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,172
I don't want a wife.
I don't want children.

50
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,758
What do you want?

51
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,394
Supper would be nice.

52
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,798
For 40 years
I've tried to teach you.

53
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,067
If you haven't learned by now,
you never will.

54
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,253
Go.

55
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,255
<i>If serving as a glorified</i>
<i>bodyguard</i>

56
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,941
is the sum of your ambition,
go serve.

57
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,660
I suppose you want
the sword back.

58
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,863
Keep it.

59
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:22,033
A one-handed man with no family
needs all the help he can get.

60
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:51,629
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

61
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,682
Please don't.

62
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,818
<i>Seems to me the smart place</i>

63
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,803
<i>to meet travelers</i>
<i>is in a tavern.</i>

64
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,655
That way, one party is late,

65
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,108
the other party can drink
some ale inside.

66
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,826
This is the Prince of Dorne
we're waiting for,

67
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,279
not one of your
sellsword friends.

68
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,498
If he's so damned important, how
come they sent you to meet him?

69
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,587
There's bad blood between
the Martells of Dorne

70
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,256
and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.

71
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,508
And just in case
the Martells of Dorne

72
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,493
are looking to spill
some Lannister blood,

73
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,930
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

74
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,665
- I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
- Oh.

75
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:30,552
Ah, here we are.

76
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,473
<i>Can you read the sigils?</i>

77
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,843
Yellow balls?

78
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,562
Wild lemons on a purple field,

79
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,897
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

80
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,319
A vulture grasping a baby in
its talons, House Blackmont.

81
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,238
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

82
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,023
Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

83
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,575
I need a sigil.

84
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,195
And House Martell, a red
sun pierced by a spear?

85
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,663
I don't see it, my lord.

86
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:06,254
Well met, my lords. His Grace King
Joffrey welcomes you in his name.

87
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,224
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

88
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,509
I am Tyrion Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

89
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,262
Master of Coin.

90
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,769
Forgive me. I don't see
Prince Doran in your company.

91
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,906
The prince's health forces
him to remain at Sunspear.

92
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,076
He sends his brother
Prince Oberyn

93
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,945
<i>to attend the royal</i>
<i>wedding in his stead.</i>

94
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,867
Yes, the king will be delighted
to enjoy the company

95
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:40,038
of a warrior as renowned as Prince
Oberyn at his wedding feast.

96
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,172
Will he?

97
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,175
And where is Prince Oberyn?

98
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,593
Arrived before dawn.

99
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,246
Not a man for welcome parties,

100
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,215
<i>our prince.</i>

101
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,918
Very well. My lords, these
fine men from the City Watch

102
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,471
will escort you to your
quarters in the Red Keep.

103
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,607
You must be weary
after such a long journey.

104
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,648
Some accomplished
diplomacy that was.

105
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,366
Now where?

106
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,320
We must find Prince Oberyn before he
kills somebody or several somebodies.

107
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,457
How do you plan on finding a single
Dornishman in a city this big?

108
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,625
You're famous for fucking
half of Westeros.

109
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,712
You just arrived at the capital
after two weeks of bad roads,

110
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,163
where would you go?

111
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,333
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

112
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,443
Look at this one.

113
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,996
How lovely is she?

114
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,915
Beautiful.

115
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,666
But pale.

116
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,668
They like them pale
in the capital.

117
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,288
Shows they don't
work the fields.

118
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,959
Do I frighten you?

119
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,162
You like?

120
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,382
Timid.
Timid bores me.

121
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,941
You're a bit of mischief,
aren't you?

122
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,112
I think she likes you.

123
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,813
She has good taste.

124
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,651
You're not timid, are you?

125
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,824
Not timid.

126
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,692
Do you like women?

127
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,661
When they look
like her, my lord.

128
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,880
This one will do nicely.

129
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,966
<i>Very good, my lady.</i>

130
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,218
Oh, I'm not a lady.

131
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,537
A term of courtesy
in this establishment.

132
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,422
A lie anywhere.

133
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,874
Why not use the right words?

134
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,510
I'm a bastard.

135
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,213
She is a whore.
And you're what?

136
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,382
A procurer.

137
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,017
Any of the others?

138
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,771
The two girls can leave.

139
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,739
You stay.

140
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,372
I'm afraid I'm not
an offer, my lord.

141
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,413
Everyone who works for
Littlefinger is an offer.

142
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:21,232
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

143
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,369
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

144
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,351
Have you ever been
with a prince?

145
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,375
Can't say I have.

146
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:36,381
I'm wildly expensive.

147
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,018
Take off your clothes.

148
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,143
Which way do you like it?

149
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,198
My way.

Forgive me for staring.

159
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,358
I don't see many
Lannisters where I'm from.

160
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,144
I don't see many
Dornishmen in the capital.

161
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:43,481
We don't like the smell.

162
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,284
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

163
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,620
Sirs, if you follow me, I'll
arrange for a private room.

164
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,922
Why are you wasting a woman
like this on a Dornishman?

165
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,041
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

166
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,549
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

167
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:10,858
You think your gold
and your lions

168
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:14,395
and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

169
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,917
May I tell you a secret?

170
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,369
You're not a golden lion.

171
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,955
You're just a pink little man

172
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,324
who is far too slow
on the draw.

173
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,636
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

174
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,922
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

175
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,591
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

176
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,895
He'll live if you
get him help straightaway.

177
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:52,567
So, decisions.

178
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,020
Prince Oberyn,
forgive the intrusion.

179
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:58,022
We heard there might be...

180
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,158
trouble.

181
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,444
Apologies, my love.

182
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,669
I'm here to welcome you
to the capital.

183
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,043
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

184
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,013
The king's own Uncle Imp.

185
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,932
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

186
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,601
If there's anything
I can do to make your stay...

187
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,419
What are you?
His hired killer?

188
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:31,889
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.

189
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,174
How did that come to pass?

190
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,560
Killed the right people,
I suppose.

191
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:43,401
We'll need a few more girls.
Girls, yes?

192
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,786
You don't partake?

193
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,538
Oh, I partook.
Now I'm married.

194
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,908
Prince Oberyn, if I may,
a word in private?

195
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,632
Seems I visited the Lannister
brothel by mistake.

196
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,134
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

197
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:03,788
The king is very grateful that you
traveled all this way for his wedding.

198
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,791
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

199
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,811
I am only the second son
after all.

200
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,896
Well, speaking
as a fellow second son,

201
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,299
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

202
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,820
Why did you come to King's
Landing, Prince Oberyn?

203
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:20,321
I was invited
to the royal wedding.

204
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,957
I thought we were
speaking truth.

205
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,245
The last time I was in the
capital was many years ago.

206
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,313
Another wedding.

207
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,482
My sister Elia

208
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,952
and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

209
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:40,792
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.

210
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,462
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

211
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,465
Elia wouldn't let
the wet nurse touch them.

212
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:51,052
And beautiful, noble
Rhaegar Targaryen

213
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,888
left her for another woman.

214
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,107
That started a war

215
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,893
and the war ended right here

216
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,195
when your father's army
took the city...

217
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,613
I wasn't actually present.

218
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,982
And butchered those children.

219
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,369
My nephew and niece.

220
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:12,540
Carved them up and wrapped
them in Lannister cloaks.

221
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,912
And my sister, you know
what they did to her?

222
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm asking you a question.

223
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,669
I've heard rumors.

224
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,338
So have I.

225
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,309
The one I keep hearing is that
Gregor Clegane the Mountain

226
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,262
raped Elia
and split her in half

227
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,630
with his great sword.

228
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:37,565
I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.

229
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,317
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

230
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,569
your father gave the order.

231
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,856
Tell your father I'm here.

232
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:50,161
And tell him the Lannisters aren't
the only ones who pay their debts.

233
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,058
Shh.

234
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,175
Shh. Shh.

235
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,495
They're dragons, Khaleesi.

236
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,331
They can never be tamed.

237
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:20,084
Not even by their mother.

238
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,441
- Ser Barristan.
- Your Grace.

239
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,777
Where's Daario Naharis?

240
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,529
Where's Grey Worm?

241
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,450
Gambling, Your Grace.

242
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,486
Gambling?

243
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:21,012
- Mhysa. Mhysa.
- Mhysa...

244
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,572
How long have they been at it?

245
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,891
Since midnight, Your Grace.

246
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,560
Ser Worm is stronger
than he looks.

247
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,446
But I can see his arms
beginning to shake.

248
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,865
What's the prize to winning
this stupid contest?

249
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,034
The honor of riding by your
side on the road to Meereen.

250
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,620
That honor goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan

251
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,006
as neither of them kept
me waiting this morning.

252
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,543
You two will ride in the rear
guard and protect the livestock.

253
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,347
The last man holding his sword

254
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,916
can find a new queen
to fight for.

255
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,914
You need to eat something.

256
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,086
Pigeon pie.

257
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,338
No, thank you.

258
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,310
Lemon cakes?

259
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,062
No, thank you.

260
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,981
You love lemon cakes.

261
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,800
Tell her she needs to eat.

262
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,569
My lady, you do need to eat.

263
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,521
I don't need to eat.

264
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,609
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

265
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,037
She needs to eat.

266
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,263
I can't let you starve.

267
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,215
<i>I swore to protect you.</i>

268
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,107
My lady,

269
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,443
I am your husband.
Let me help you.

270
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:36,363
How can you help me?

271
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,033
I don't know, but I can try.

272
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:45,039
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy

273
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,908
thinking about how they died.

274
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,278
I could get you essence of
nightshade to help you sleep.

275
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,497
Do you know what
they did to my brother?

276
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,836
How they sewed his direwolf's
head onto his body?

277
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,339
And my mother.

278
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,925
They say they cut
her throat to the bone

279
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,062
and threw her body
in the river.

280
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:12,099
<i>What happened to your family</i>
<i>was a terrible crime.</i>

281
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,402
I didn't know your brother. He seemed
like a good man, but I didn't know him.

282
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:18,439
<i>Your mother, on the other hand,</i>

283
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,491
<i>I admired her.</i>

284
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,693
She wanted to have me executed,

285
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,745
but I admired her.

286
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,532
She was a strong woman.

287
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,668
And she was fierce

288
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,343
when it came to
protecting her children.

289
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,374
Sansa.

290
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,929
Your mother would want
you to carry on.

291
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,297
You know it's true.

292
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,054
Will you pardon me, my lord?

293
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,639
I'd like to visit the godswood.

294
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,775
Of course. Of course. Prayer
can be helpful, I hear.

295
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,528
I don't pray anymore.

296
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:01,115
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

297
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:21,585
My lion.

298
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:24,088
What are you doing?

299
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,511
What does it look like
I'm doing? Come here.

300
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,230
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

301
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,899
I know.
I know.

302
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,184
We have come
to a dangerous place.

303
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,687
Have you forgotten me? Do you
know how long it's been?

304
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,021
Of course I haven't forgotten.

305
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,357
I want you.

306
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,858
Don't you want me?

307
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,946
Things are a bit tense
right now.

308
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,115
What things?

309
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,200
My nephew the king
wants to murder me.

310
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,869
My wife hates me because my
father murdered her family.

311
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,340
Oberyn Martell wants to murder
everyone whose last name is Lannister.

312
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:03,877
You need to relax.

313
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,638
Don't you want to relax?

314
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,062
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

315
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,565
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

316
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,651
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

317
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,287
- Do you love her?
- Love her?

318
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,489
I barely know her.
She's a child.

319
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,159
- She despises me.
- That's not an answer.

320
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,378
Of course I don't love her.

321
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,463
You tried to ship me away.

322
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,582
Ship you away?

323
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:45,419
Give me diamonds
and make me disappear.

324
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,304
What in the world
are you talking about?

325
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,223
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

326
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,043
- Say it!
- Shh.

327
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,145
I don't know what
you're talking about.

328
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,815
You want me to stay?

329
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,429
A work of art, really.

330
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,314
The craftsmanship is excellent.

331
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,767
You like it so much, you're welcome to
chop off your own hand and take it.

332
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,719
Such an ingrate. I spent
days with the goldsmith

333
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:38,355
- getting the details just right.
- Days?

334
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,774
Better part of an afternoon.

335
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,444
There, how does that feel?

336
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,312
Uh...

337
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,597
a hook would be more practical.

338
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:49,483
Elegant, I think.

339
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,207
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

340
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,443
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

341
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:00,961
I am in your debt,
Maester Qyburn.

342
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:03,330
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help

343
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,249
whenever I can.

344
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,843
Odd little man.

345
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,845
I've grown rather fond of him.

346
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,796
He's quite talented, you know?

347
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,465
What symptoms?

348
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,817
Symptoms that are
not your concern.

349
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:26,103
You let him touch you?

350
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,305
You jealous?

351
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:30,023
I'm surprised.

352
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,475
You never let Pycelle near you.

353
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:33,643
You think I'd let
that old lecher

354
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,913
put his hands on me?

355
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,499
He smells like a dead cat.

356
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,918
<i>I'm not sure I've ever</i>
<i>smelled a dead cat.</i>

357
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,153
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

358
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:45,873
You drink more
than you used to.

359
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,958
- Yes.
- Why?

360
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:52,212
Let's see, you started a brawl
in the streets with Ned Stark

361
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,348
and disappeared
from the capital.

362
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:56,917
My husband died in a tragic
hunting accident.

363
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:58,668
It must have been
traumatic for you.

364
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:00,104
My only daughter
was shipped off to Dorne.

365
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,772
<i>We suffered through a siege.</i>

366
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,440
A rather short siege.

367
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,842
A rather short siege that I
didn't expect to survive.

368
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,811
And now I'm marrying
my eldest son

369
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,980
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden

370
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,116
while I'm supposed
to marry her brother,

371
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,735
a renowned pillow biter.
So...

372
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,354
Father disowned me today.

373
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,740
He can't disown you.
You're all he's got.

374
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,242
You're forgetting Tyrion.

375
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:25,996
You don't really plan on staying
in the Kingsguard, do you?

376
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:33,537
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here

377
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:35,889
in the Red Keep with you.

378
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:39,193
- Not now.
- I want...

379
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:42,429
Not now? When?
I've been back for weeks.

380
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:49,186
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

381
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,189
You come back after all
this time with no apologies

382
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,724
and one hand and expect
everything to be the same?

383
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:56,059
What do you want me
to apologize for?

384
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:57,528
For leaving me.

385
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,062
You think I wanted
to be taken prisoner?

386
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,998
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

387
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,567
You left me alone.

388
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:07,204
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

389
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,541
Every day. I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

390
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,126
- You took too long.
- I...

391
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,214
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you took too long.

392
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,551
- Come in.
<i>- Go away.</i>

393
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,769
Forgive me, Your Grace.

394
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:26,390
You told me to come at once if
there was anything important.

395
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,745
You plan on killing
all the crows yourself?

396
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:53,500
Do you plan on sitting here
scratching your balls till winter?

397
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,536
We wait for Mance's orders.

398
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,588
You sent a man over the Wall
at the full moon.

399
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,556
<i>If he's not back yet,</i>
<i>he's not coming back.</i>

400
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,091
<i>And what is it you want?</i>

401
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,594
March on Castle Black
with just this lot?

402
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,630
Your pretty crow said 1,000
men are nesting there.

403
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:08,398
Yeah, well, he's a liar.

404
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,133
He is?

405
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:12,486
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

406
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,305
You said you put
three arrows in him.

407
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:16,973
I did.

408
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,577
I've seen you slip a shaft through
a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

409
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,965
If that boy's still walking,
it's 'cause you let him go.

410
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,942
Thenns.

411
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,461
I fucking hate Thenns.

412
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,540
Mance sent you?

413
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,992
How did you find us?

414
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,466
You came from the south,
not the north.

415
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,835
Took a detour.

416
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:22,306
Got some supper from
a village down that way.

417
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,377
<i>Why does the meat down here</i>
<i>taste so much better</i>

418
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,563
than it does
on our side of the Wall?

419
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,264
Help yourself.

420
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:36,937
Maybe everything's
just better fed down here.

421
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,324
Fat and lazy.

422
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,610
Easier for us, hmm?

423
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,081
You didn't see us coming?

424
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,866
Lost your warg?

425
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,838
And that baby crow
you had with you,

426
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,207
lost him too?

427
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,378
I'll answer to Mance.

428
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,413
I won't answer to you.

429
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:06,049
She yours?

430
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:10,220
I'm not anybody's.

431
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,365
Too scrawny.

432
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,035
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.

433
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,789
<i>Think of them</i>
<i>stuck in their larders</i>

434
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:31,958
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

435
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:35,545
and stew, getting nice and fat

436
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,247
and marbled.

437
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,168
I know we've had
our differences, Tormund,

438
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,555
but just one time
before you die,

439
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,760
you really ought to try crow.

440
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,331
<i>Draw.</i>

441
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,266
Loose.

442
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,324
<i>Last time I saw him,</i>

443
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,610
<i>he was in the courtyard</i>
<i>at Winterfell.</i>

444
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,081
<i>He said, "Next time I see you,</i>

445
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,967
<i>you'll be all in black."</i>

446
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,755
I was jealous of Robb
my whole life.

447
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,242
<i>The way my father</i>
<i>looked at him,</i>

448
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:24,244
<i>I wanted that.</i>

449
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:27,431
He was better than me
at everything...

450
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,968
fighting and hunting

451
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,638
and riding

452
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,473
and girls.

453
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,526
<i>Gods, the girls loved him.</i>

454
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,814
I wanted to hate him,
but I never could.

455
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,985
Sometimes I want to hate you.

456
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,825
Well, you're better
than me at everything.

457
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,411
Except reading.

458
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:04,718
They're...
they're ready for you.

459
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,591
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

460
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,926
No one's going to hang you.

461
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,427
You've done nothing wrong.

462
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,347
I've done plenty wrong.

463
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,902
So you admit you
murdered Qhorin Half hand?

464
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,687
<i>I didn't murder him.</i>

465
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,189
No?
You put your sword

466
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:28,158
through a brother
of the Night's Watch.

467
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,226
What do you call that?

468
00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:32,362
He wanted me to kill him.

469
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,197
A bastard son of a traitor.

470
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:35,615
What would you expect?

471
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,567
The Half hand believed
our only chance

472
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:39,870
to stop Mance was to get
a man inside his army.

473
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,173
Don't talk about the Half hand as
if you knew him. He was my brother.

474
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,009
Then you'd know he'd do
anything to defend the Wall.

475
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,845
The free folk would have boiled him
alive, but letting me kill him...

476
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,014
<i>- The free folk?</i>
<i>- Listen to him.</i>

477
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,550
He even talks like
a wildling now.

478
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,353
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

479
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,972
I climbed the Wall
with the wildlings. I...

480
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:02,442
I laid with a wildling girl.

481
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:07,147
You admit to breaking
your vows, then?

482
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:09,449
I do.

483
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:13,436
The law is the law.
The boy must die.

484
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:17,607
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

485
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:21,378
the Wall would be manned
by headless men.

486
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,547
There's a difference
between sneaking off

487
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:27,384
to the Mole's Town brothel
and sleeping with the enemy.

488
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:29,836
While we sit here

489
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,305
debating which rules I broke,

490
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,876
Mance Rayder marches on the
Wall with an army of 100,000.

491
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,310
Impossible.

492
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,512
You can't get
50 wildlings together

493
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,064
before they start
killing each other.

494
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,467
100,000.
He's united the Thenns,

495
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,102
<i>the Hornfoots,</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

496
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,604
He has giants fighting for him.

497
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,689
Giants?

498
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,142
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?

499
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,311
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

500
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,114
And now you're here. You must not
have been very good at your job.

501
00:36:58,165 --> 00:36:59,366
How dare you?!

502
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,502
There's a band of wildlings
south of the Wall already

503
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,588
led by Tormund Giantsbane.

504
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,322
I killed their warg
and three others.

505
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,625
They shot me full of arrows.

506
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,295
Their orders are to attack
Castle Black from the south

507
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,631
when Mance hits
it from the north.

508
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,166
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

509
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,519
Mance said it would be
the greatest fire

510
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:20,971
the North has ever seen.

511
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,640
<i>That's the truth.</i>

512
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,392
All the truth.

513
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:33,233
Do you intend to execute me
or am I free to go?

514
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,568
None of us are free.

515
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,454
We are men
of the Night's Watch.

516
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:41,791
But we won't be taking
your head today, Jon Snow.

517
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,326
Go on.

518
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:56,556
I am acting commander here,
Maester Aemon.

519
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,475
Yes, you are.

520
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,376
And I don't trust the bastard.

521
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:03,430
He told the truth.

522
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,649
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

523
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,018
How did you acquire
this magical power?

524
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,572
I grew up in King's Landing.

525
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,944
<i>No. No.</i>

526
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,697
You're a queen, not an ox.

527
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,017
Your grandfather
gave me a necklace

528
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,420
just like this one
for my 51st nameday.

529
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,074
The wedding is in
a fortnight, Grandmother.

530
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:33,126
You can't say no to everything.

531
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,795
Nonsense.
My little dears.

532
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,798
Go and speak to the
jewelers of King's Landing.

533
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,417
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.

534
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,603
The one who brings
me the best necklace

535
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:46,272
will get to keep the next best.

536
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:53,313
The Margaery Tyrell
who walks into the sept

537
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,866
a fortnight from now
will inspire 1,000 songs.

538
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:00,320
Now, how sad it will be if she's
wearing rubbish like that.

539
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,790
Perhaps I should just let
Joffrey choose it for me.

540
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,109
End up with a string of dead
sparrow heads around my neck.

541
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:09,713
You watch that.
Even here, even with me.

542
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,783
My word.

543
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:16,469
My lady.
My lady.

544
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:19,472
Please pardon me
for interrupting.

545
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:21,307
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

546
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,976
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

547
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,562
But hearing is one thing.

548
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,264
Aren't you just marvelous?

549
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:31,601
Absolutely singular.

550
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,187
I hear you knocked
my grandson into the dirt

551
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,440
like the silly little
boy he is.

552
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:39,909
My lady, I know this is
a very busy time for you,

553
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,612
but if I could
just have a moment.

554
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,665
You dare not refuse.

555
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:49,786
A shadow?

556
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,422
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

557
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:57,761
I swear to you by all
the gods it was Stannis.

558
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,513
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart

559
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:03,049
and disappeared.

560
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,969
One day, my lady,
I will avenge our king.

561
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,337
Joffrey is our king now.

562
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:10,523
I meant no offense.

563
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:12,442
And you've given none.

564
00:40:21,735 --> 00:40:23,953
All the Kingsguard
will be on duty, of course.

565
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,789
Ser Boros
will be stationed here.

566
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,791
Ser Preston
will be stationed here

567
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,377
beside the primary
entertainment.

568
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,798
Your Grace?

569
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,383
Yes, yes, one guard at the...

570
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,219
the thing.
Go on.

571
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:42,472
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

572
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,141
I've always guarded
the king himself, my lord.

573
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,376
Ever since your absence.

574
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:49,479
And I thank you
for it, Ser Meryn.

575
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,215
All very good.
I don't expect any trouble.

576
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,017
The people love their king.

577
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,551
They know who keeps them fed.

578
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,587
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

579
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,573
By my leave.

580
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:03,776
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.

581
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,828
The war's not won.
Not while Stannis lives.

582
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,198
I broke Stannis
on the Blackwater.

583
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,617
Pity you weren't
there to help, Uncle.

584
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,386
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

585
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,622
Busy getting captured.

586
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,676
So this is the famous
"Book of Brothers"?

587
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,679
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

588
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,768
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.

589
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,806
Led the attack on the
Kingswood Brotherhood.

590
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,192
Defeated the Smiling Knight
in single combat.

591
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,945
Ser Duncan the Tall.

592
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,399
Four pages for Ser Duncan.

593
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:44,984
He must have been quite a man.

594
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,870
So they say.

595
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,374
Ser Jaime Lannister.

596
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,447
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

597
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:01,417
- There's still time.
- Is there?

598
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:04,587
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

599
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:07,807
How can you protect me
with that?

600
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,425
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

601
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,811
Makes for more of a contest.

602
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:31,497
Have you ever been to Meereen?

603
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:33,983
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

604
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:35,418
And?

605
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,620
They say 1,000 slaves died

606
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:39,455
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

607
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:41,708
And now an army
of former slaves

608
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,127
is marching to her gates.

609
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,346
You think the Great
Masters are worried?

610
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,349
If they're smart, Your Grace.

611
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:55,355
You were told to ride
at the back of the train.

612
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:57,140
Yes, my queen.

613
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,943
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

614
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,895
A matter of strategy.

615
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,451
Your Grace.

616
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,657
All right, what is this
matter of strategy?

617
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,629
A dusk rose.

618
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,048
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

619
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:25,084
And this one's called
lady's lace.

620
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,203
Would you like
to walk without shoes?

621
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:29,472
You have to know
a land to rule it.

622
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,591
Its plants, its rivers,

623
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,344
its roads, its people.

624
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,729
Dusk rose tea eases fever.

625
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:38,514
Everyone in Meereen knows that.

626
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:40,850
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

627
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,385
If you want them to follow you,

628
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:44,020
you have to become
a part of their world.

629
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:45,438
Strategy.

630
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,276
Harpy's Gold.

631
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:51,911
No tea from this one.

632
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,197
Beautiful but poisonous.

633
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:02,755
You are a gambler, aren't you?

634
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:12,432
Your Grace.

635
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,300
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

636
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:50,636
How many miles are there
between here and Meereen?

637
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:54,090
163, Your Grace.

638
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,259
<i>I'll tell our men to ride</i>
<i>ahead and bury them.</i>

639
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,793
You don't need to see this.

640
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:00,930
You will do no such thing.

641
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,650
I will see each
and every one of their faces.

642
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:08,938
Remove her collar
before you bury her.

643
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,646
<i>There she is.</i>

644
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:19,999
Yes, there she is.

645
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,287
- And?
- You made a promise.

646
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:27,507
To return the Stark girls to
their mother who is now dead.

647
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,125
To keep them safe.

648
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,127
Well, Arya Stark
hasn't been seen

649
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,795
since her father was killed.

650
00:45:32,846 --> 00:45:35,498
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

651
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,636
There's a certain safety
in death, wouldn't you say?

652
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:40,937
And Sansa Stark is now
Sansa Lannister.

653
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,772
Bit of a complication.

654
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,341
A complication does not
release you from a vow.

655
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,600
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?

656
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:50,313
And take her where? Where
would she be safer than here?

657
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,148
Look me in the eye and tell me

658
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,484
that you think she'll be
safe in King's Landing.

659
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,576
Are you sure we're not related?

660
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,878
Ever since I've returned,
every Lannister I've seen

661
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:07,530
has been a miserable
pain in my ass.

662
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:09,048
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

663
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:11,918
You've got the hair for
it if not the looks.

664
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:05,471
It's all right.

665
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,607
It's all right.
It's all right.

666
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,861
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

667
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,363
I have good reason to be.

668
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:18,201
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

669
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,121
Don't you know me?

670
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:27,627
Ser Dontos. The king's
nameday celebration.

671
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,912
I'm sorry. I should
have remembered.

672
00:47:29,963 --> 00:47:31,998
I can't accept your apology.

673
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,501
I may be a fool, but I'm a
living fool, thanks to you.

674
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,920
Anyone would have
done the same.

675
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,889
But only you did.

676
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,425
I can never repay you.

677
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,794
You gave me my life.
But this,

678
00:47:45,812 --> 00:47:49,065
this is worth
more than my life.

679
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,437
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.

680
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,322
House Hollard was strong once.

681
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:58,357
House on the rise.

682
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,943
That's all that's left
of those days,

683
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:04,797
thanks to a few sad,
fat drunks like me.

684
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:06,782
I can't take it.

685
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:09,869
It's very, very kind
of you, but I can't.

686
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,088
I don't have
anything else left.

687
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,624
That's all.

688
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,342
Take it.
Wear it.

689
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:18,961
Let my name have one
more moment in the sun

690
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:21,213
before it disappears
from the world.

691
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,104
I'll wear it with pride,
Ser Dontos.

692
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,389
Yeah.

693
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,367
<i>When am I going to get</i>
<i>a horse of my own?</i>

694
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,703
The little lady wants a pony.

695
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:03,539
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

696
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:06,475
Horses aren't easy to come by.

697
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,229
Even if they were, you think I'm
gonna put you on your own horse?

698
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:13,733
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

699
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:16,602
Why don't you have any money?

700
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,188
Didn't you steal anything
from Joffrey before you left?

701
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,190
No.

702
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,242
You're not very smart, are you?

703
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:25,227
I'm not a thief.

704
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:27,246
You're fine with
murdering little boys,

705
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,165
but thieving is beneath you?

706
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,867
A man's got to have a code.

707
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:34,320
You think I'm gonna escape?

708
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:36,372
Where would I go?

709
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,341
I'd be dead by nightfall
without you.

710
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,843
My family's gone.
I've got no one.

711
00:49:41,928 --> 00:49:44,130
You've got an aunt in the Vale.

712
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,383
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her,

713
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,418
maybe she'll have
enough left over

714
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:51,554
to buy you that pony
you want so much.

715
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,977
<i>- I'm hungry.</i>
<i>- You're hungry.</i>

716
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,563
Five horses, five men.

717
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:04,116
More than I feel like
killing on an empty stomach.

718
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,742
I know him.

719
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,494
<i>The small one.</i>
<i>His name is Polliver.</i>

720
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:18,631
He captured us
and took us to Harrenhal.

721
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,835
He killed Lommy.

722
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,637
What the fuck's a Lommy?

723
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:27,223
He was my friend.

724
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,226
Polliver stole my sword and put
it right through his neck.

725
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:33,729
He's still got it.

726
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,481
<i>Got what?</i>

727
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:37,400
My sword Needle.

728
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:41,270
Needle? Of course you
named your sword.

729
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,605
Lots of people
name their swords.

730
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,774
Lots of cunts.

731
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:52,782
What are you...
get back here.

732
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,417
My brother gave me that sword.

733
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,152
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

734
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,921
I don't care
if he ate your friend.

735
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,873
We're not going in there.

736
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,179
<i>Come on, give it up.</i>

737
00:51:11,384 --> 00:51:13,502
Come here.

738
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,605
- Let's have a feel there.
- Leave it.

739
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,720
Come here.

740
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:51,557
Please, she's a good girl.

741
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,208
Shut your mouth
and pour us more ale

742
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:56,226
and we may not take her with
us when we're done with her.

743
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,568
I know you.

744
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:06,989
You're the Hound.

745
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:11,026
<i>Pour our new friend some ale.</i>

746
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:17,750
What brings you so far north?

747
00:52:17,784 --> 00:52:19,368
I could ask the same of you.

748
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,419
What are you doing up here?

749
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:22,070
Just keeping the king's peace.

750
00:52:22,088 --> 00:52:23,839
No need.
The war's over.

751
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,209
So I've heard. Stannis
defeated at the Blackwater.

752
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,261
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.

753
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,546
And where am I for all of it?

754
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,631
Stuck with your brother.

755
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,250
- Meaning no offense.
- None taken.

756
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,936
He's good, the Mountain is.

757
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,437
Best at what he does.

758
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:41,757
But torture, torture,
torture, torture.

759
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:44,527
<i>You spend enough time putting
the hammer to people,</i>

760
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,596
<i>you start to feel like</i>
<i>a carpenter making chairs.</i>

761
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:49,698
Drains the fun right out of it.

762
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,373
And what's life
without a little fun?

763
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,655
But I don't need
to tell you that, eh?

764
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:01,276
She's all right.
I've had better.

765
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,882
You know what?

766
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,751
You should come with us.

767
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:12,638
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

768
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:15,624
Gold, silver, more daughters.

769
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:18,110
<i>Always something if you</i>
<i>know how to make them talk.</i>

770
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:20,646
And there's plenty of him between
here and King's Landing.

771
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,398
You could do well for yourself.

772
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,233
We certainly have been.

773
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,805
I'm not going
to King's Landing.

774
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:32,491
Think about it. We could
do whatever we like

775
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:35,327
wherever we go.

776
00:53:35,362 --> 00:53:37,312
These are the king's colors.

777
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:39,331
No one's standing
in his way now.

778
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,534
Which means no one's
standing in ours.

779
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,821
Fuck the king.

780
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:58,133
When I heard that Joffrey's
dog had tucked tail

781
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,269
and run from the Battle
of the Blackwater,

782
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,354
I didn't believe it.

783
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,107
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

784
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,726
Bring me one of those chickens.

785
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,895
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

786
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,347
No.

787
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,149
But we're the king's men.

788
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,703
So, you got money?

789
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,538
Not a penny.

790
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:22,458
I'll still take that chicken.

791
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,192
Tell you what.

792
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:26,245
We'll trade you.

793
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,464
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

794
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,467
<i>Give us a go at your friend.</i>

795
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,870
Lowell there likes them
a bit broken in.

796
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:44,596
You're a talker.

797
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,234
Listening to talkers
makes me thirsty.

798
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,869
Ah.

799
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,871
And hungry.

800
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,623
Think I'll take two chickens.

801
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,801
You don't seem to
understand the situation.

802
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,471
I understand that
if any more words

803
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:28,157
come pouring out
of your cunt mouth,

804
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:31,894
I'm gonna have to eat every
fucking chicken in this room.

805
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,663
You lived your life
for the king.

806
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:38,317
You're gonna die
for some chickens?

807
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,570
Someone is.

808
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,857
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

809
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,859
What?
What do you mean?

810
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,862
Can you walk?
I've got to carry you?

811
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,697
Carry me?

812
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,784
Fine little blade.

813
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,592
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.
