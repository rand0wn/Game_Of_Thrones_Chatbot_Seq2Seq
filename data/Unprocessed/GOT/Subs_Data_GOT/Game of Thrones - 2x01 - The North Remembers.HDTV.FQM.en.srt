- but much better looking.

Can't imagine why.

66

- I'm glad you're not dead.

00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:29,049
Me, too, dear.

68
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,351
Death is so boring,
especially now

69
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:34,388

in the world.

70
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:36,658
My Lady, I'm sorry
for your loss.

71
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:39,728
Her loss?

72
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:41,663
Her father was
a confessed traitor.

73
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,298
But still her father.

74
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,334
Surely having so recently
lost your own beloved father

75
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:47,269
you can sympathize.

76
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,208
My father was a traitor.

77
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,109
My mother and brother
are traitors, too.

78
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:58,346
I am loyal

79
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,949
Of course you are.

Wish I could stay

00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,396
Why are you here?

87
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:28,574

88
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,743

the Seven Kingdoms,

89
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:34,213

00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:39,886
The longest summer
in living memory.

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,888
The peasants say,
a long summer means

93
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:44,825
- <i>an even longer winter.</i>
- Pycelle: <i>A common superstition.</i>

Littlefinger: <i>We have enough wheat</i>
<i>for a five-year winter.</i>

95
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,197
If it lasts any longer,

96
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:52,865
we'll have
fewer peasants.

97
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,868
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

98
00:06:55,902 --> 00:06:57,369
We have nowhere
to house them.

99
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,538
And with winter coming,
it'll only get worse.

100
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,507
You command the City Watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

101
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,877
<i>I do, Your Grace.</i>

102
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,913
And are you not
a Lord at my command?

103
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:11,450
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

104
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,120
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

105
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:17,089
They belong in the field,
not our capital.

106
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:20,526
- Yes, Your Grace.
- <i>( Man whistling tune )</i>

107
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,865
Don't get up.

108
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:31,803
More ravishing than ever,
big sister.

109
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:35,607
War agrees with you.

110
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:38,543
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.

111
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,179
What are you doing here?

112
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:44,915
Ah, it's been
a remarkable journey.

113
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,619
I pissed off the edge
of the Wall,

114
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:51,555
<i>I slept in a sky cell,</i>

115
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,824
I fought with
the hill tribes--

116
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:56,594
so many adventures,

117
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:59,331
so much to be
thankful for.

118
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:02,635
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

119
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,997
Yes. well I, do believe,
the Hand of the King,

120
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,941
is welcome at all
small council meetings.

121
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,977
Our father
is Hand of the King.

122
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:13,047
Yes, but in his absence...

123
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:22,456
Varys: <i>Your father has named</i>
<i>Lord Tyrion</i>

124
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:25,226
to serve as Hand
in his stead while he fights.

125
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,928
Out! All of you out!

126
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,303
Cersei: I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

127
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,305
Tyrion: If I were capable
of tricking father,

128
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:38,940
I'd be emperor
of the world by now.

129
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:41,576
You brought this
on yourself.

130
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,077
I've done nothing.

131
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,979
Quite right--
you did nothing

132
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,381
when your son called
for Ned Stark's head.

133
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,383
Now the entire North
has risen up against us.

134
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:51,886
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

135
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,056
That bit of theater will haunt
our family for a generation.

136
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,093
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

137
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,329
Do you understand
we're losing the war?

138
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:04,599
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

139
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,401
But I know people.

140
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,503
And I know that our enemies hate
each other

141
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:11,439
almost as much
as they hate us.

142
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:18,380
- Joffrey is King.
- Joffrey is King.

143
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:20,949
You are here
to advise him.

144
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:22,651
I'm only here
to advise him.

145
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,220
And if the King listens
to what I say,

146
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:28,890
the King might just get
his Uncle Jaime back.

147
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:32,093
How?

148
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:33,695
You love your children.

149
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,229
It's your one
redeeming quality.

150
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:38,198
That and your cheekbones.

151
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,067
The Starks love
their children as well.

152
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,703
- And we have two of them.
- One.

153
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:48,274
- One?
- Arya, little animal-- she disappeared.

154
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,344
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?

155
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,416
We had three Starks
to trade.

156
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,186
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

157
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:02,188
Father will be furious.

158
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:04,858
It must be odd for you...

159
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:09,663
to be the disappointing child.

160
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,138
<i>( Crow cawing )</i>

161
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:21,009
Leadranach: <i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

162
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,712
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

163
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:27,716
<i>The walls of my Holdfast</i>
<i>will not stand the winter.</i>

164
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,620
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

165
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:34,022
and I'm afraid
the masons today

166
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:37,792
are not fit to carry
their fathers' hammers.

167
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:40,227
When I was a boy,
I remember seeing them

168
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:44,831
<i>put up a new tower</i>
<i>at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</i>

169
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,967
<i>Men worked back then.</i>

170
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,903
Today, my Holdfast
looks like it was built

171
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:52,172
by drunk children.

172
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:56,344
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

173
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,346
<i>And the Gods</i>
<i>forbid it rains.</i>

174
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,616
Why, I might as well sleep
beneath a waterfall.

175
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,285
Luwin:
<i>Maintenance of a Holdfast</i>

176
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,722
generally falls
to the lord of that Holdfast.

177
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:08,224
Generally, yes,

178
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,925
but I've sent
all the young men off

179
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,861
to fight
Robb Stark's war.

180
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,997
King Robb.
And it's not his war.

181
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:16,932
He didn't choose it.

182
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,400
Maybe not, My Lord,

183
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,535
but he called in his Banners
and took the men.

184
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,303
Bran:
<i>Joffrey killed my father,</i>

185
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:24,772
your liege lord.

186
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:27,274
Do you remember
your vows, Ser?

187
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:29,176
Of course I remember!

188
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,279
We can spare four masons
for a week, My Lord.

189
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:35,349
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

190
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:37,685
I-- I believe it will.

191
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:45,995
We didn't want him here
all day, did we?

192
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:50,299
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

193
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,134
Nor did I.

194
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:57,272
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

195
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:01,377
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

196
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:03,245
( Sighs )

197
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,548
Luwin:
<i>Lord Portan.</i>

198
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:09,617
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,555
<i>( Heavy breathing )</i>

201
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:24,231
- <i>( Wings flapping )</i>
- <i>( Bird squawking )</i>

202
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:04,775
Boil this for an hour
and drink the tea.

203
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,312
Makes all your pain
go away.

204
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:09,981
Bran:
Don't have any pain.

205
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,615
Lucky for you.

206
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,518
That way.

207
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,490
You've been having
those dreams again.

208
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,358
Bran:
<i>I don't dream.</i>

209
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,926
Everyone dreams.

210
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,895
I don't.

211
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,997
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

212
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:30,166
<i>They say it's an omen.</i>

213
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,870
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the South.

214
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:35,505
Did they?

215
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,844
Osha: I heard some other fools
say it's Lannister Red.

216
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,248
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

217
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,685
Heard a stableboy say
it's the color of blood

218
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,088
to mark the death
of your father.

219
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:57,161
The stars
don't fall for men.

220
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:59,763
The red comet means
one thing, boy--

221
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:02,499
dragons.

222
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:07,069
The dragons are all dead.

223
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:09,572
They've been dead
for centuries.

224
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,841
( Shrieks )

225
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,878
Mmm.

226
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:50,847
Mmm. Mmm.

227
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,585
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

228
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,287
He said they ate meat.

229
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:01,024
He didn't tell you
what kind of meat?

230
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,960
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

231
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:07,129
He didn't know anything
about anything.

232
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,604
Eh.

233
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,476

<i>( Women murmuring )</i>

235
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,001
She was Drogo's
first gift to me.

236
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:46,037
I remember.

237
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,542
I promised
to protect them.

238
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,910
Promised them their enemies
would die screaming.

239
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:55,446
How do I make
starvation scream?

240
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:58,483
A trick I never learned,
I'm afraid.

241
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,386
Does it ever end?

242
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,388
This is farther east
than I've ever been.

243
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,956
But, yes, Khaleesi,

244
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,458
everything ends,
even the red waste.

245
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:10,060
And you're sure
there's no other way?

246
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,830
If we go south to the land
of the Lazarheen,

247
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,332
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

248
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,267
If we go west
to the Dothraki Sea,

249
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:19,336
the first
Khalasar we meet

250
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,904
will kill us
and take your dragons.

251
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,607
No one will take
my dragons.

252
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,478
They are too weak to fight,

253
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,513
as are your people.

254
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,883
You must be
their strength.

- You offered me a ride.

I just wanted you to shut up about
your damn blisters.

270
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:05,170
I was born in a place
like this.

271
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:08,340
Later, I fell
on hard times.

Samwell:
<i>Are those girls?</i>

Dolorous Edd:
<i>Craster's daughters.</i>

I haven't seen a girl

He don't like people
messing with his wives.

278
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,194
He marries
his daughters,

<i>and they give him</i>
<i>more daughters.</i>

Always treated me

Haven't had any good wine
for a long time.

You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

We're not Southerners.

You're prettier
than half my daughters.

299

You got a nice wet twat
between your legs?

300

What's your name?

301

- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

302
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:35,327
Listen to me, bastard.

303

All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

304

But now you're in the North,

I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters--

No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:57,150
Now, sit down
and shut your mouth.

00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:02,156
You bring any of that
good wine with you?

310
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,025
We did.

311
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,561
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,210
Craster: <i>You want to know</i>
<i>where they've all gone?</i>

318
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:27,547
<i>North... to join up</i>
<i>with Mance Rayder...</i>

319
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:30,449
Your old friend.

320
00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:33,119
He's no friend of mine.

321
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:36,286
He broke his vows,
betrayed his brothers.

322
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,511
Oh, aye.

323
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,695
But once he was
just a poor black crow.

324
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:43,665
And now he's
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

325
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,168
He's been calling
himself that for years.

326
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:49,939
What's he king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?

327
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,376
That's a good-looking axe.

328
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,545
<i>Fresh forged?</i>

329
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,083
Give it here.

330
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,285
You'll have another one
made at Castle Black.

331
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,221
Here.

332
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:08,058
Oh, that's some
lovely steel.

333
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:14,898
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

334
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,733
Gathering an army.

335
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,002
<i>What I hear,</i>
<i>he's already got more men</i>

336
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,338
<i>than any of your</i>
<i>southern kings.</i>

337
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,874
And where does he plan
marching this army?

338
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:25,375
When you're
all the way north,

339
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,144
there's only
one direction to go.

340
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:33,984
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

341
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,321
The cold winds
are rising.

342
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,858
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.

343
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,361
Wife...

344
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,432
tell the Lord Crow
how content we are.

345
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,834
This is our place.

346
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,769
Our husband keeps us safe.

347
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,973
Better to live free
than die a slave.

348
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:01,245
Craster: <i>Don't it make you</i>
<i>jealous, old man,</i>

349
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,347
to see me with
all these young wives

350
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,650
and you with no one
to warm your bed?

351
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,619
We chose different paths.

352
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:13,090
Oh, aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

353
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:18,094
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

354
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:20,196
and eat me out of pigs.

355
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,132
A roof would be welcome.

356
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,700
It's been hard riding.

357
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,936
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

358
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,275
Any man lays a hand
on one of my wives,

359
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:35,278
he loses the hand.

360
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:40,916
And I see this one
staring too long,

361
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:44,186
I might just gouge
his eyes out.

362
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,490
Your roof, your rules.

363
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,437
( Grunts )

364
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,773
Who am I?!

365
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,244
- Who am I?!
- Lord commander.

366
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,447
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

367
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,083
Who <i>are</i> you?

368
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,385
Your steward.

369
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,520
You want to lead
one day?

370
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,025
Then learn
how to follow.

371
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:36,573
<i>( Man panting )</i>

372
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:44,281
Melisandre: <i>Lord of Light, come to us</i>
<i>in our darkness.</i>

373
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:48,019
We offer you
these false Gods.

374
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,988
Take them and cast
your light upon us...

375
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,727
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

376
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:00,263
Men: For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

377
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:04,166
Melisandre:
<i>After the long summer,</i>

378
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,236
<i>darkness will fall heavy</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

379
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,972
The stars will bleed.

380
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:12,375
We need to stop her.

381
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:16,212
Melisandre: <i>The cold breath of winter</i>
<i>will freeze the seas...</i>

382
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,644
Not now.

383
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:18,869
<i>...And the dead shall rise</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

384
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,989
All you men were named
in the Light of the Seven!

385
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,159
<i>Is this how you treat</i>
<i>the Gods of your fathers?</i>

386
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,897
Are you so eager to spit
on your ancestors?

387
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,906
You smell of fear--

388
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:49,210
fear and piss
and old bones.

389
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:52,146
Do you want to stop me?

390
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:58,452
Stop me.

391
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,001
In the ancient books,
it's written

392
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:17,072
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

393
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,276
And that sword shall be
Lightbringer.

394
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,585
Stannis Baratheon,

395
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,187
warrior of light,

396
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:34,123
your sword awaits you.

397
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,647
<i>( Men cheering )</i>

398
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,858
Men: Lord, cast your
light upon us!

399
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:12,729
Melisandre: <i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

400
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:19,035
For the night is dark
and full of terror.

401
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:49,732
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

402
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,400
Stannis is our king.

403
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:52,768
We follow
where he leads,

404
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,504
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

405
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,639
Since that boar
killed his brother,

406
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:59,708
every lord wants
a coronation.

407
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,843
I don't serve the others.
I serve Stannis.

408
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:05,580
As do I,
but loyal service

409
00:28:05,614 --> 00:28:08,550
means telling
hard truths.

410
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:12,653
He's surrounded
by fools and fanatics,

411
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:15,456
but he trusts you, Davos.

412
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:18,593
If you tell him
the truth...

413
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:21,931
What's the truth?

414
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:36,379
Matthos: <i>"And I declare upon</i>
<i>the honor of my house</i>

416
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,483
he wasn't
my beloved brother.

417
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,718
I didn't love him.
He didn't love me.

418
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,587
A harmless courtesy,
Your Grace.

419
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,988
A lie.
Take it out.

420
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:50,826
"...that my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

422

- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

425

Call him what he is.

429
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:13,651

<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

430
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:15,887
Whatever else he is,

435
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:28,700
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

436
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:31,136
I'll not make
the same mistake.

437
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,205
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the Realm,

438
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:35,106
from the Arbor
to the Wall.

439
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:38,043
The time has come
to choose.

440
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,545
Let no man claim ignorance
as an excuse.

441
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,181
Your Grace,the Lannisters
are the true enemy.

442
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,250
If, for the time being, you could
make peace with your brother--

443
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,552
I'll not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

444
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,421
Well, many have already
declared for him--

445
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,590
Mace Tyrell,
Randyll Tarly.

446
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,860
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

447
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,462
<i>The Lord of Light</i>
<i>stands behind him.</i>

And how many ships has

449
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,568
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

but we do if we're
going to war.

If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

Who would steal

They'll bend the knee

I owe you
an apology, my King.

Shall we drink together?

00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,269
Don't.

463
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:42,108
A cup of wine to honor
the one true God.

I keep expecting you
to leave me

472
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:18,109
in one castle or another
for safekeeping,

473
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:22,180
but you drag me along
from camp to camp.

474
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:24,849
Have you grown
fond of me, Stark?

475
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:26,684
Is that it?

476
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:28,720
I've never seen you
with a girl.

477
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,257
If I left you with
one of my bannermen,

478
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,327
your father would know
within a fortnight

479
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:38,831
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message:

480
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:42,434
"Release my son and you'll be rich
beyond your dreams.

481
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:46,005
Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

482
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,340
You don't trust
the loyalty

483
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,676
of the men following
you into battle?

484
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:54,214
Oh, I trust them
with my life,

485
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,249
just not with yours.

486
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:58,117
Smart boy.

487
00:32:58,152 --> 00:32:59,786
What's wrong?

488
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,787
<i>Don't like</i>
<i>being called "boy"?</i>

489
00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:04,757
Insulted?

490
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,261
<i>( Direwolf snarling )</i>

491
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:14,599
Robb: <i>You insult yourself,</i>
<i>Kingslayer.</i>

492
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:19,670
- <i>You've been defeated by a boy.</i>
- <i>( Heavy breathing )</i>

493
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:22,172
<i>You're held captive</i>
<i>by a boy.</i>

494
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:26,877
<i>Perhaps you'll be</i>
<i>killed by a boy.</i>

495
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:35,386
Stannis Baratheon
sent ravens

496
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,790
to all the high lords
of Westeros.

497
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:42,495
King Joffrey Baratheon
is neither a true king

498
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:45,164
<i>nor a true Baratheon.</i>

499
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,333
He's your bastard son.

500
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:49,937
<i>If that's true,</i>
<i>Stannis is the rightful king.</i>

501
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:52,005
How convenient for him.

502
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:56,309
My father learned
the truth.

503
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:58,011
That's why
you had him executed.

504
00:33:58,046 --> 00:34:00,414
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

505
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:02,550
Your son killed him

506
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,018
so the world wouldn't
learn who fathered him.

507
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:08,089
And you-- you pushed
my brother from a window

508
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,091
because he saw you
with the queen.

509
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:13,662
( Snarling )

510
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:18,300
You have proof?

511
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,836
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

512
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:23,039
I'm sending one of your cousins
down to King's Landing

513
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:24,708
with my peace terms.

514
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:27,778
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

515
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:30,214
You don't know him
very well.

516
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:34,618
No, but he's starting
to know me.

517
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:38,287
<i>Three victories</i>
<i>don't make you a conqueror.</i>

518
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:42,391
It's better than
three defeats.

519
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:50,265
( Snarling )

520
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,424
Shae:
<i>This city stinks...</i>

521
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,793
( Sniffs )

522
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:17,395
Like dead bodies.

523
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,563
Tyrion:
<i>A bit corpsey, yes.</i>

524
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:22,065
And shit.

525
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,000
I thought you wanted
to come here.

526
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:29,705
I love it.

527
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:33,409
You love the smell
of dead bodies and shit?

528
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:36,479
And cum and garlic
and rum.

529
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:39,649
You can smell cum
from the balcony?

530
00:35:39,683 --> 00:35:43,020
I love the stink.
I love the noise.

531
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:45,156
Cities make me
want to fuck.

532
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,493
And so did the country.

533
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:51,563
( Sighs )

534
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:53,097
This is where I belong.

535
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes, well, you need
to be careful.

536
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,601
No one can know
you're here.

537
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:59,303
No one will know.

538
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,904
You can't trust anyone
in King's Landing.

539
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:04,107
<i>They're all liars--</i>
<i>good liars, bad liars,</i>

540
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,576
one or two great liars.

541
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,611
What about you?

542
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:11,280
Me? I'm not from here.
I'm a slave to the truth.

543
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:14,116
( Laughs )
Truth?

544
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,884
( Laughs )

545
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:19,088
You are the biggest
little liar I have ever met.

546
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:21,123
Why do you think
I am so little?

547
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:25,693
I'm being crushed beneath the
weight of all that truth.

548
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:29,830
Oh!

549
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:32,667
Ned Stark actually
slept on this.

550
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:36,538
As if the poor man
didn't suffer enough.

551
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:41,811
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

552
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:56,291
- Lord Baelish.
- Your Grace.

553
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:58,894
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

554
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,429
Of course,
Your Grace.

555
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,397
Ned Stark's youngest
daughter Arya--

556
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,633
we can't seem
to locate her.

557
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:07,168
If she's escaped
the capital,

558
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:09,270
Winterfell seems
the logical destination.

559
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:11,840
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

560
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:13,808
Curious.

561
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,977
If we choose to negotiate
with the Starks,

562
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,280
the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her--

563
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:20,849
well, you know what they say about
Lannisters and debts.

564
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,885
Well, you could ask
Varys where she is.

565
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,221
He'll have
an answer for you.

566
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,823
Whether you believe it...

567
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:30,728
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

568
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,397
- Who knows what they want?
- ( Chuckles )

569
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:36,533
A mockingbird.

570
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,327
You created your
own Sigil, didn't you?

571
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:39,552
Yes.

572
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:42,406
Appropriate...
for a self-made man

573
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,174
with so many
songs to sing.

574
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,842
I'm glad you like it.

575
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,745
Some people are
fortunate enough

576
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:49,412
to be born into
the right family.

577
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,115
Others have to find
their own way.

578
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,518
I heard a song once

579
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:58,187
about a boy
of modest means

580
00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:01,957
who found his way into the
home of a very prominent family.

581
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:03,759
He loved
the eldest daughter.

582
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:07,196
Sadly, she had eyes
for another.

583
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,598
When boys and girls
live in the same home,

584
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:12,267
awkward situations
can arise.

585
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:14,936
Sometimes, I've heard,
even brothers and sisters

586
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,471
develop
certain affections.

587
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,940
And when these affections
become common knowledge,

588
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:23,843
well, that is an awkward
situation indeed,

589
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:26,179
especially
in a prominent family.

590
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:29,649
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

591
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,918
I've found.

592
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:34,087
And which truth is that?

593
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:37,758
Knowledge is power.

594
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:42,330
Seize him.

595
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:46,168
Cut his throat.

596
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:49,772
Stop. Wait.

597
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:52,175
I've changed my mind.
Let him go.

598
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:56,812
Step back three paces.

599
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:00,616
Turn around.

600
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,317
Close your eyes.

601
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:08,958
Power is power.

602
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:12,180
Do see if you can
take some time away from

603
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:14,119
your coins and your whores

604
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:16,265
to locate
the Stark girl for me.

605
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:19,835
I would very much
appreciate it.

606
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:31,847
Robb:
<i>You're Ser Alton Lannister?</i>

607
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,450
I am, Your Grace.

608
00:39:34,484 --> 00:39:38,021
<i>I offer your cousins peace</i>
<i>if they meet my terms.</i>

609
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:42,358
First, your family
must release my sisters.

610
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:46,061
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

611
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:48,029
so he may rest beside
his brother and sister

612
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:50,799
in the crypts
beneath Winterfell.

613
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,002
And the remains of all those
who died in his service

614
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:55,237
must also be returned.

615
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:57,774
Their families can honor
them with proper funerals.

616
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,877
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- <i>Third...</i>

617
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:05,016
Joffrey and the Queen Regent
must renounce all claim

618
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,652
to dominion of the North.

619
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,888
From this time
till the end of time,

620
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:12,457
we are a free
and independent kingdom.

621
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,459
The King in the North.

622
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:16,961
All:
King in the North.

623
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:18,563
Neither Joffrey
nor any of his men

624
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:20,832
shall set foot
in our lands again.

625
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,767
If he disregards
this command,

626
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:26,338
he shall suffer
the same fate as my father,

627
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:30,675
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

628
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:34,212
These are-- Your Grace,
these are--

629
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:36,781
these are my terms.

630
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:39,951
If the Queen Regent and her son
meet them, I'll give them peace.

631
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,954
If not...

632
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:45,423
I will litter the south
with Lannister dead.

633
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,360
King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
Your Grace.

634
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,195
Oh, is he?

635
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:54,733
You'll ride at daybreak,
Ser Alton.

636
00:40:54,768 --> 00:40:57,402
That will be all
for tonight.

637
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:14,286
A word, Your Grace?

638
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:18,790
You don't have to call me
"Your Grace" when no one's around.

639
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:21,527
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

640
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,395
I'm glad someone's
gotten used to it.

641
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:26,765
The Lannisters are going to reject
your terms, you know?

642
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:28,500
Of course they are.

643
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:30,869
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

644
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:34,606
but we won't beat them until you
take King's Landing.

645
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:39,278
And we can't take
King's Landing without ships.

646
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:41,947
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

647
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,749
Men who fought
my father.

648
00:41:43,784 --> 00:41:46,218
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

649
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:50,056
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

650
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:54,294
I'm his only living son.

651
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:57,464
He'll listen to me.
I know he will.

652
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,169
I'm not a Stark.
I know that.

653
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:06,173
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

654
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,444
We can avenge him
together.

655
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:14,715
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

656
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,017
I need his ships.
They say he has 200.

657
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:20,621
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

658
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,590
Shall we rally them
to fight for us?

659
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,458
I understand you don't
trust Lord Greyjoy.

660
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:29,163
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
he is not trustworthy.

661
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:31,832
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

662
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:35,737
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

663
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:38,039
Before me, it was father.

664
00:42:38,073 --> 00:42:39,740
You married one rebel
and mothered another.

665
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,777
I mothered more than
just rebels,

666
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,145
a fact you seem
to have forgotten.

667
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,181
If I trade the Kingslayer
for two girls,

668
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:49,482
my bannermen will string me up
by my feet.

669
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:52,686
You want to leave Sansa
in the Queen's hands?

670
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,788
<i>And Arya--</i>

671
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,824
I haven't heard
a word about Arya.

672
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,593
What are we fighting for
if not for them?

673
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,228
It's more complicated
than that!

674
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,397
You know it is.

675
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:21,450
It's time for me
to go home.

676
00:43:21,484 --> 00:43:24,386
I haven't seen Bran
or Rickon in months.

677
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:28,057
You can't go
to Winterfell.

678
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:30,059
I beg your pardon?

679
00:43:30,093 --> 00:43:33,228
I'll send Rodrik
to watch over the boys

680
00:43:33,263 --> 00:43:37,799
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

681
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,834
Why in the name
of all the Gods--

682
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,771
because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

683
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:45,940
He's rallied
an army of 100,000.

684
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:47,709
You know him.
You know his family.

685
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:50,177
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

686
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:51,746
<i>You have a hundred</i>
<i>other lords--</i>

687
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,650
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

688
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:58,486
If Renly sides with us,

689
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,955
we'll outnumber them
two to one.

690
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:03,925
When they feel the jaws beginning
to shut, they'll sue for peace.

691
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,694
We'll get the girls back.

692
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:10,231
Then we'll all
go home... for good.

693
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:20,308
( Sighs )
I will ride at first light.

694
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:32,553
We will all be together
again soon, I promise.

695
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,160
You've done so well.

696
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:45,332
Your father
would be... proud.

697
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:56,077
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- <i>King</i> Renly.

698
00:44:57,413 --> 00:45:00,182
There's a king
in every corner now.

699
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:04,820
( Hammering )

700
00:45:13,129 --> 00:45:15,663
What is all this?

701
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:17,966
Returning this room
to its proper appearance.

702
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,868
Say what you will about the Targaryens--
they were conquerors.

703
00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:23,738
That is a seat
for a conqueror.

704
00:45:23,772 --> 00:45:27,441
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

705
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,843
We can't find Arya Stark.

706
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:32,012
With luck, she's dead
in a ditch somewhere.

707
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:34,014
Perhaps. But if not,
we need her.

708
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:36,383
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

709
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:39,019
I think they might.
They're weak.

710
00:45:39,054 --> 00:45:40,888
They put too much value
on their women.

711
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:44,758
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

712
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:46,660
Send out as many men
as we can.

713
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:48,496
I'm sure if you asked
grandfather--

714
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,533
The King does not ask;
He commands.

715
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:55,436
And my grandfather's
stupidity in the field of battle

716
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,372
is the reason Robb Stark has
Uncle Jaime in the first place.

717
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:01,107
His life is in danger.

718
00:46:01,142 --> 00:46:02,776
We're at war.

719
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,911
All our lives
are in danger.

720
00:46:08,915 --> 00:46:12,418
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime.

721
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,086
And you.

722
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:16,756
Our enemies
will say anything

723
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,791
to weaken your claim
to the throne.

724
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:20,961
It's not a claim.
The throne is mine.

725
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:24,365
Of course it is.

726
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:28,236
No one believes
this foul gossip.

727
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,405
Someone believes it.

728
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:34,375
Father had
other children?

729
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,945
Besides me and Tommen
and Myrcella?

730
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:40,715
What are you asking?

731
00:46:40,749 --> 00:46:43,151
I'm asking if he fucked
other women

732
00:46:43,186 --> 00:46:44,720
when he grew tired
of you.

733
00:46:44,754 --> 00:46:46,555
How many bastards
does he have running--

734
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:49,425
( silence )

735
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:57,532
( Work resumes )

736
00:47:02,304 --> 00:47:06,540
What you just did
is punishable by death.

737
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:12,679
You will never
do it again.

738
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,648
Never.

739
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:22,789
That will be all,
Mother.

740
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:29,362
( Loud moaning )

741
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:31,498
No, no, no, no.

742
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:34,335
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

743
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:35,837
Ease into it.

744
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:38,873
Slowly, with passion.

745
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:42,644
( Moaning )
Oh, yeah.

746
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:46,548
( Sighs ) Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.

747
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:49,185
Both of you
are working tonight.

748
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:54,923
We do things
differently here, Daisy.

749
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:58,926
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

750
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,461
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

751
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:03,330
Our establishment
doesn't cater

752
00:48:03,364 --> 00:48:06,132
to ploughmen
and goat herders.

753
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,267
Lord Olsen.

754
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,002
Taste is
everything here.

755
00:48:10,036 --> 00:48:11,904
Littlefinger's
a fancy man.

756
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:13,706
Don't call him
Littlefinger.

757
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:15,174
He doesn't like it.

758
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:17,677
<i>Lord Baelish.</i>

759
00:48:22,884 --> 00:48:25,452
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

760
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,055
so that people
will think she's exotic.

761
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,992
She grew up just down the road
in flea bottom.

762
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:33,595
She's beautiful.

763
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:36,865
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

764
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:38,566
<i>( Armor rattling )</i>

You do realize
this establishment

770
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:06,229
is owned by
Lord Petyr Baelish,

the King's
Master of Coin...

772
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:10,400
Coin which goes
in many pockets.

773
00:49:10,435 --> 00:49:13,137
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

774
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:16,172
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

775
