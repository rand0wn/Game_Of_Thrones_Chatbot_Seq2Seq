2
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,970
- We shouldn't be out here alone.
- Why not?

3
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,678
- If your father--
- He'll never know we're gone.

4
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,746
But if he finds out...

5
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,263
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

6
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:49,803
Are you sure?

7
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,595
Yes.

8
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:54,804
- We shouldn't go in.
- Of course we should.

9
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:42,262
Get out.
Get out!

10
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,220
- Let's go.
- No.

11
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:45,996
Listen to your friend.

12
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:49,053
They said that you
were terrifying

13
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:53,137
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

14
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,013
You're not terrifying.

15
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,512
You're boring.

16
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,614
You don't know what I am.

17
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:04,132
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

18
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,428
Tell me mine.

19
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,720
Everyone wants
to know their future

20
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,845
until they know their future.

21
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:15,220
This is my father's land.
My land.

22
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:20,265
Tell me my future or I'll have your two
boring eyes gouged out of your head.

23
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,512
Your blood.

24
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:34,054
Give me a taste.

25
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:01,335
Three questions you get.

26
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,346
You won't like the answers.

27
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,720
I've been promised
to the prince.

28
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,845
When will we marry?

29
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,521
You will never wed the prince.

30
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,512
You will wed the king.

31
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:18,970
But I will be queen?

32
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:21,387
Oh, yes.

33
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,720
You'll be queen.

34
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:25,595
For a time.

35
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:28,678
Then comes another,

36
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,178
younger,

37
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,803
<i>more beautiful,</i>

38
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:36,095
<i>to cast you down</i>
<i>and take all you hold dear.</i>

39
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:39,303
W-will the king and I
have children?

40
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:44,699
No. The king will have 20
children and you will have three.

41
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,803
That doesn't make sense.

42
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,262
Gold will be their crowns.

43
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:52,138
Gold their shrouds.

44
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:00,970
Come on, we have to go.

45
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:04,428
We have to go!
Cersei!

46
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,387
<i>Bearers, put it down.</i>

47
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,095
<i>Bearers, up.</i>

48
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,846
<i>Away.</i>

49
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:47,262
<i>Your Grace, we are</i>
<i>honored by your presence.</i>

50
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,678
<i>The mourners are waiting.</i>

51
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:51,193
They will keep waiting.

52
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,046
I want a moment alone with him.

53
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,505
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

54
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,671
day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

55
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:59,422
They will wait.

56
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:28,796
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

57
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,547
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

58
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:38,297
What he built, it's ours.

59
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:42,422
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

60
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,171
They're going to try
to take it away.

61
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:47,546
- All of it.
- They?

62
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,255
All of them out there,
our enemies.

63
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:52,046
They're waiting in line to make sure
he's really dead.

64
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,838
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

65
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,671
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

66
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:59,421
They have nothing to do with it.

67
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:01,713
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

68
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,046
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

69
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,088
You've been defending
him for years.

70
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,255
This is exactly what they want.

71
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,880
And now our father is dead

72
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:12,339
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

73
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:16,631
Did you set him free?

74
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:20,963
Tyrion may be a monster,

75
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,963
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

76
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,088
You killed him by mistake.

77
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,881
With stupidity.

78
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,796
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

79
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:34,338
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

80
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,339
Never mind the consequences.

81
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:42,005
Take a look.

82
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:43,006
Look at the consequences.

83
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,839
Here they are.

84
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:55,006
He loved you more than
anyone in this world.

85
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:29,089
Apologies.

86
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,463
I still don't see
why I had to stay

87
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,546
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

88
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,463
I saved your life.

89
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:50,213
If they catch you,
they catch me.

90
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,255
I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

91
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,338
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

92
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,046
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

93
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,713
through one of those airholes?

94
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,005
No, I only know what it's like

95
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:03,172
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

96
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,796
Pentos?

97
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,255
The home of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

98
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,630
a merchant.

99
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,588
He and I met many years ago

100
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,005
through mutual friends.

101
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:20,380
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

102
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,838
for the disaster he was.

103
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,880
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

104
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:28,421
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

105
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,046
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

106
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,671
that has led us both here.

107
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:37,130
Things have gotten worse,
not better.

108
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:40,214
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

109
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,838
Mmm.

110
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,296
Much better.

111
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:48,964
My lord?

112
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:53,838
I don't think I am anymore.

113
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,047
A lord.

114
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,839
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

115
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:11,880
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

116
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,838
for killing a whore.

117
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,755
It must happen all the time.

118
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,171
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

119
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,755
In a box.
Why stop now?

120
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:23,172
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

121
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,756
The future is shit.

122
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,839
Just like the past.

123
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,218
_

124
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:29,692
_

125
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:41,900
_

126
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:43,752
_

127
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,909
_

128
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,213
Shh.

129
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:56,922
Shh.

130
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,213
<i>The Sons of the Harpy?</i>

131
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:45,546
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

132
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:46,880
They've never killed before.

133
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:49,380
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

134
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,880
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

135
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,963
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

136
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:57,841
_

137
00:15:58,016 --> 00:16:02,177
_

138
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:05,046
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

139
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,046
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

140
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,546
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

141
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:12,005
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

142
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,546
What was the name
of the man you lost?

143
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:18,005
White Rat, Your Grace.

144
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:22,171
I want him buried
with honor, publically

145
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,588
in the Temple of the Graces.

146
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,630
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

147
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,338
Make them very angry.

148
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,296
Angry snakes lash out.

149
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,005
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

150
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:36,422
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

151
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:40,797
Your Grace.

152
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,296
Torgo Nudho.

153
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:59,172
Missandei hin Naath.

154
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:02,756
I wanted to speak with you.

155
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,921
Why do you come?

156
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,881
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

157
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,381
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

158
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,546
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

159
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,214
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

160
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:33,714
May I ask you why?

161
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:37,797
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

162
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:44,297
I do not know.

163
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,839
<i>I must go.</i>

164
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:05,046
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

165
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,338
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

166
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,881
Now get it up.

167
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:24,046
Come.
Try it again.

168
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,171
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

169
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,630
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

170
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,421
Shouldn't you be training, too?

171
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,922
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

172
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:40,755
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

173
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:43,880
I might be the first in history.

174
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,796
<i>- Shield up.</i>
<i>- These men need a firm hand.</i>

175
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,546
Always have.

176
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,714
They're poachers and thieves.

177
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,297
Not soldiers.

178
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,881
That one hates me.

179
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,213
If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new Lord Commander...

180
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:09,880
He hates the wildlings.

181
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,671
All the wildlings.

182
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,255
- Don't let them send us away.
- <i> It's not a sure thing.</i>

183
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,796
Ser Denys Mallister has
commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years

184
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,630
and people say he's a good man.

185
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:19,755
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

186
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:22,380
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

187
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:23,630
I told you.

188
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:26,755
Wherever you go, I go, too.

189
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:29,047
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

190
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,007
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

191
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:41,756
Shield up.

192
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,214
The king wants a word.

193
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,838
You're not cold, my lady?

194
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,005
Never.

195
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:22,006
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

196
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,547
Feel.

197
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,631
Are you a virgin?

198
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,172
No.

199
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,631
Good.

200
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,796
Your Grace.

201
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:56,006
The bastard of Winterfell.

202
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,839
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

203
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,796
Roose Bolton.

204
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:13,089
Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

205
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,631
Don't you want to avenge him?

206
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:20,963
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

207
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:23,463
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

208
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:26,796
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

209
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,505
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

210
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:30,213
<i>Many don't.</i>

211
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:34,213
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

212
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:35,880
<i>Why?</i>

213
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,088
It's where she belonged.

214
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,505
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

215
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,463
too much affection
for the wildlings.

216
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,880
They were born on the
wrong side of the Wall.

217
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:45,921
That doesn't make them monsters.

218
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,213
No matter.

219
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:48,213
I shall take back the North

220
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,130
from the thieves who stole it.

221
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,713
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

222
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:56,296
I shall mount Roose Bolton's
head on a spike.

223
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:59,005
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

224
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,005
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

225
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:04,005
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

226
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,756
I'm talking about the wildlings.

227
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:17,880
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

228
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,880
to march in your army?

229
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,171
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

230
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,755
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

231
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:24,671
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

232
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll give them land to live on.

233
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:31,046
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

234
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,005
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

235
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:36,046
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

236
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,168
I don't think that's likely.

237
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:41,421
You admire him, don't you?

238
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:44,171
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

239
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,088
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

240
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,422
...or he burns.

241
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,796
How much time do I have?

242
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,463
Nightfall.

243
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,755
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

244
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:58,421
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

245
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,630
<i>Shield up.</i>

246
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:06,463
<i>Attack, my lord!</i>

247
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:07,838
Attack!

248
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,463
Don't cross your feet.

249
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:13,213
My sons had swords
in their hands

250
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:14,838
from the time they could walk.
This one...

251
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,005
<i>Lord Arryn will never</i>
<i>be a great warrior.</i>

252
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,005
<i>Great warrior?</i>

253
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:21,630
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

254
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:24,546
My lord.

255
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:26,421
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

256
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,796
Some boys develop more slowly.

257
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,088
He's still young.

258
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,213
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

259
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:43,255
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

260
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,046
The gift of a great name.

261
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:49,796
Sometimes that's all one needs.

262
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:57,505
Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
for all you've done for me.

263
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,921
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

264
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,255
I have no doubt
that on my return,

265
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:04,213
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

266
00:24:04,214 --> 00:24:05,380
He'll be safe here.

267
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:09,338
<i>As for his skills,</i>

268
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,547
I make no promises.

269
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,713
Will we head north
at some point?

270
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:31,005
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

271
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,630
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

272
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:35,714
- But that will take us--
- Us?

273
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:40,255
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

274
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:41,922
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

275
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:47,005
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

276
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:49,005
No one knows what you look like.

277
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,421
No one cares.
You're safe.

278
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:54,922
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

279
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:57,505
An attendant to a knight.

280
00:24:57,506 --> 00:25:00,130
I'm not a knight.

281
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,380
That means you're not a squire.

282
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,463
Well, where would I go?

283
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:06,339
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

284
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,130
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

285
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:19,921
I found Arya. She didn't want
my protection.

286
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:22,131
- <i> Sansa still might.</i>
- Will you shut your mouth?

287
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:25,131
I didn't ask for your advice.

288
00:25:26,964 --> 00:25:29,796
I don't want anyone
following me.

289
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,713
I'm not a leader.

290
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,713
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

291
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:37,631
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

292
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,880
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

293
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:53,088
I did.

294
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:56,213
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

295
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:58,172
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

296
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:03,463
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

297
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:05,838
but he's not alone
in that castle.

298
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,921
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

299
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:10,130
<i>stable boys and serving girls?</i>

300
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:13,088
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

301
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,546
No.

302
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,171
But I pay them well

303
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,463
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

304
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:21,838
So where are we going?

305
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,255
To a land where
you trust everyone?

306
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:27,005
To a land so far from here,

307
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,926
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

308
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,881
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

309
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:45,588
Your father was a--

310
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,546
a force to be reckoned with.

311
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:49,755
He truly was.

312
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:52,921
I wouldn't presume to claim

313
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,255
to have known him
as such, but--

314
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:58,796
<i>but just being in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>

315
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:00,963
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

316
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:04,338
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

317
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,256
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

318
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:16,463
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

319
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,505
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

320
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:21,547
I often warned...

321
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,381
Your Grace.

322
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:31,630
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

323
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,921
My deepest sympathies.

324
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:37,046
I apologize
for my son's appearance.

325
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,168
Uncle, it's quite all right.

326
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,630
They call themselves sparrows.

327
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,338
Bloody fanatics.

328
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,338
Religion has its place,
of course,

329
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,171
but at a certain point...

330
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:54,130
They never would have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

331
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,796
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

332
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:57,796
whatever it is.

333
00:27:57,797 --> 00:28:00,339
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

334
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,463
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

335
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,839
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

336
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:29,464
What can I do for you?

337
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:32,713
You can forgive me.

338
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,546
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

339
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,255
I led you into the darkness.

340
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:39,671
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

341
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:42,463
I tempted you into our...

342
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:45,714
unnatural relations.

343
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:49,714
And, of course,
there was the king...

344
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:54,131
his boar hunt.

345
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,214
His wine.

346
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,755
I don't know what
you're talking about.

347
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:06,006
I'm a different person now.

348
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:10,546
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

349
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,213
<i>You can, too.</i>

350
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:13,838
<i>They watch over all of us,</i>

351
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,380
ready to dole out mercy

352
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,881
or justice.

353
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:23,631
Their world is at hand.

354
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,046
I will pray for
your father's soul.

355
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:34,214
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

356
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,505
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

357
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:48,421
It does.

358
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:52,547
That's the--
that's the Sunspear bit right there.

359
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,463
And that's where
the mountains are.

360
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:58,796
And over here is--

361
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,588
is Sunsnake?

362
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,213
Stonespear?

363
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,713
Sandstone.

364
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:06,296
Yes.

365
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:08,713
Yes, Sandstone.

366
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,463
Just there.

367
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:13,464
Fine.

368
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:16,839
It's Dorne.

369
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:21,338
We should go there.

370
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:23,713
I think we would
have a lovely time,

371
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:26,088
judging by my experience.

372
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:30,838
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

373
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,381
Anywhere but here.

374
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,422
We're late for dinner as it is.

375
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:45,838
You're very respectful.

376
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,714
I'm very hungry.

377
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:07,171
What's your name?

378
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:08,838
Olyvar, my lady.

379
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,671
I'm afraid my brother

380
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:14,131
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

381
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,839
My lady.

382
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,088
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

383
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,838
Why?

384
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,171
They all know about me anyway.

385
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:48,463
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

386
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:51,630
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

387
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:54,922
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

388
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:58,338
My intended?
Please.

389
00:31:58,339 --> 00:31:59,755
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

390
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:02,171
<i>That means no one</i>
<i>can force Cersei to marry me.</i>

391
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,380
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

392
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,838
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

393
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,921
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

394
00:32:09,922 --> 00:32:12,630
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

395
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,213
<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>

396
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,797
Perhaps.

397
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,880
Perhaps?

398
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:21,714
Perhaps.

399
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:39,296
Eunuch, the Spider, the
Master of Whisperers.

400
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:42,589
Imp, Half-man.

401
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,255
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

402
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,005
Not for a coward.

403
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:51,046
You are many things, my friend,

404
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,797
but not a coward.

405
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:59,130
You never told me
why you set me free.

406
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:02,130
Your brother asked me to.

407
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,380
Could have said no.

408
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,630
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

409
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:08,880
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

410
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,588
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

411
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,255
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

412
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:15,838
I didn't do it for you.

413
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,880
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

414
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:22,130
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

415
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:24,380
I don't believe in saviors.

416
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,756
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

417
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:31,171
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

418
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:35,255
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

419
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:38,463
You have many
admirable qualities,

420
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,838
self-pity is not
one of them.

421
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,130
Any fool with a bit of luck

422
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:45,671
can find himself
born into power.

423
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:49,338
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

424
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm not well-suited
for work.

425
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:53,505
I think you are.

426
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:55,588
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

427
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:57,171
And you have compassion.

428
00:33:57,172 --> 00:34:00,380
Compassion? Yes.

429
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,005
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

430
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:06,796
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

431
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,838
I never said you were perfect.

432
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,796
What is it you want exactly?

433
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,796
Peace.

434
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:16,255
Prosperity.

435
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:20,338
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

436
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,796
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

437
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:25,296
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

438
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,588
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

439
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:30,005
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

440
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:31,921
Perhaps.

441
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:35,505
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

442
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,131
we assume there's no other way.

443
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,921
<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,</i>

444
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:43,088
<i>would you spread misery</i>
<i>throughout the land?</i>

445
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:45,505
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

446
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,921
<i>No, you won't.</i>

447
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,296
<i>But you could help another</i>
<i>climb those steps</i>

448
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,796
and take that seat.

449
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:55,838
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

450
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,130
but gentler than Stannis.

451
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:01,046
A monarch who can intimidate the
high lords and inspire the people.

452
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:05,130
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

453
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,005
and the right family name.

454
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:09,296
Good luck finding him.

455
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:12,339
Who said anything about "him"?

456
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,671
You have a choice, my friend.

457
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:20,671
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

458
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:23,255
and drink yourself to death,

459
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,588
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

460
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,046
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

461
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,464
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

462
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:35,547
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

463
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,088
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

464
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,922
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

465
00:35:54,256 --> 00:35:58,088
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

466
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,671
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

467
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,546
to a council of elders
made up of both

468
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:04,963
the freed men and
the former slaveholders.

469
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,088
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

470
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:08,838
Good.

471
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,380
They did ask
for some concessions.

472
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,130
Concessions?

473
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:16,213
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

474
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:19,130
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

475
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:22,380
<i>Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>

476
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,796
Still, it's easier to rule happy
subjects than angry ones.

477
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,796
I don't expect
the Wise Masters to be happy.

478
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:31,171
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

479
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,255
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

480
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,839
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

481
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:40,505
The fighting pits?

482
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,005
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

483
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:44,880
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

484
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:47,214
free men would fight free men.

485
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,130
<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>

486
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:52,213
<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>

487
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:54,546
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

488
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,755
No fighting pits.

489
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,088
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

490
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,046
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

491
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:02,463
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

492
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:05,714
- If you-- - How many times must I say no
before you understand?

493
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,505
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

494
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:14,046
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

495
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,213
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

496
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:19,088
What?

497
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:20,714
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

498
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:25,463
She liked to drink pear brandy.

499
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:29,546
The older she got, the less
she made selling her body,

500
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,921
the more she wanted to drink.

501
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:35,130
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

502
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:37,755
she fucked the night before.

503
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,046
I'm sorry.

504
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:42,796
Why?
I was a bad child.

505
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,588
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

506
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:47,880
And I loved to fight.

507
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,880
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

508
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,046
who trained fighters
for the pits.

509
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:54,671
I had my first match
when I was 16.

510
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,838
You were sold into slavery,

511
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,296
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

512
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:00,817
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

513
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:05,296
I'm only here
because of those pits.

514
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:07,921
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

515
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:09,338
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

516
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,963
Soon I was famous.

517
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,213
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

518
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:15,296
when I stepped into the pit.

519
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:16,796
I made so much money
for my master,

520
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,588
he set me free when he died.

521
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,380
I joined the Second Sons.

522
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:24,297
And then I met you.

523
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:31,130
You're the queen.

524
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:34,671
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

525
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:37,255
Everyone but me.

526
00:38:37,256 --> 00:38:41,463
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

527
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:44,255
As soon as they see weakness,

528
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,505
they'll attack.

529
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:50,046
Show your strength here, now.

530
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:52,208
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

531
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:57,963
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

532
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:01,713
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

533
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,874
You're the Mother of Dragons.

534
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:14,422
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

535
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,296
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

536
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:20,756
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

537
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,839
I can't control them anymore.

538
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:32,796
A dragon queen with no dragons

539
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:33,922
is not a queen.

540
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,631
Viserion?

541
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:46,506
Rhaegal?

542
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,046
Easy. Easy.

543
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,213
Easy.

544
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:43,838
So here we are.

545
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,922
Here we are.

546
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,505
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

547
00:41:51,506 --> 00:41:53,714
And now, for our last meeting...

548
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,505
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

549
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:01,922
No, but it will be.

550
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,796
You know what Stannis wants?

551
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:09,338
He wants me to bend the knee.

552
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:11,713
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

553
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:14,921
I'll give him this much,

554
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:16,255
he's bold.

555
00:42:16,256 --> 00:42:17,796
Shouldn't a king be bold?

556
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:19,880
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

557
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:23,005
I respect him.

558
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:24,546
If he gets what he wants,

559
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:26,255
I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools

560
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:30,171
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

561
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,631
But I'll never serve him.

562
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:35,671
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

563
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,005
You told me your people
have bled enough.

564
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,630
That's right.

565
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:41,921
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

566
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:45,380
You spent your life convincing
90 clans to come together

567
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,463
for the first time in history.

568
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:49,630
Thenns and Hornfoots,

569
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:52,713
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

570
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:55,713
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

571
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:59,088
You didn't do it for glory.

572
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:01,255
You brought them
together to save them

573
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,796
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>

574
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,671
<i>not if they're north</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

575
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:06,671
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

576
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,506
Pride?

577
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,214
Fuck my pride.

578
00:43:14,506 --> 00:43:16,797
This isn't about that.

579
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,922
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

580
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:28,046
They followed me
because they respected me.

581
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,005
Because they believed in me.

582
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:32,380
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

583
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:35,671
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

584
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:38,921
How many women?
How many children?

585
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:41,963
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

586
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,171
You're afraid of looking afraid.

587
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:47,006
Oh, I am afraid.

588
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,797
No shame in that.

589
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:03,088
How will they do it?
Beheading?

590
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:04,964
Hanging?

591
00:44:07,672 --> 00:44:10,256
They'll burn you alive.

592
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,714
Bad way to go.

593
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,671
I'll be honest with you.

594
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:24,671
I don't want to die.

595
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:26,838
And burnt to death,

596
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,796
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

597
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,671
scorched and screaming.

598
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:33,463
But it's better than betraying

599
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:35,171
everything I believe.

600
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,630
And what happens to your people?

601
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:41,380
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

602
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:43,796
and they'll sing
songs about you.

603
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:45,255
You'd rather burn than kneel.

604
00:44:45,256 --> 00:44:46,922
The great hero.

605
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:52,630
Until winter comes and
the white walkers come for us all

606
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:55,297
and there's no one left to sing.

607
00:44:57,714 --> 00:44:59,296
You're a good lad.

608
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,463
Truly you are.

609
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:07,505
But if you can't understand why I won't
enlist my people

610
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:10,255
in a foreigner's war,

611
00:45:10,256 --> 00:45:12,256
there's no point explaining.

612
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,838
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

613
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:35,213
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

614
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:36,881
was all I ever wanted.

615
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:50,213
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

616
00:46:50,214 --> 00:46:52,963
Westeros only has one king.

617
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:55,297
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

618
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,964
Kneel and live.

619
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:22,131
This was my home for many years.

620
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,463
I wish you good fortune

621
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:28,131
in the wars to come.

622
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:12,546
We all must choose.

623
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:17,130
Man or woman, young or old,

624
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:20,546
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

625
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:24,046
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

626
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:27,088
<i>We choose good</i>
<i>or we choose evil.</i>

627
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:31,797
We choose the true god
or the false.

628
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,671
Free folk,

629
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,088
<i>there is only one true king</i>

630
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,213
<i>and his name is Stannis.</i>

631
00:48:50,214 --> 00:48:52,671
Here stands your king of lies.

632
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:55,797
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

633
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:55,748
