Ramsay:<i> — Tansy!

2
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:57,411
Woman: — Tansy! Tansy!

3
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:00,547
Ramsay: — Tansy!
— ( dogs barking )

4
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,499
( growling )

5
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,802
( laughing )

6
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:12,009
( laughing )

7
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:19,349
Ramsay: — Tansy!

8
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,401
— ( screams )
— There you are.

9
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:23,353
( barking )

10
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:24,333
( screaming )

11
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,666
I can't see her, Ramsay.

12
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:30,087
( panting )

13
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,755
Tansy!

14
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:34,474
( whimpering )

15
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,300
If you make it out
of the woods, you win!

16
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:40,803
Run, Tansy, run!

17
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:43,772
( screams )

18
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:46,725
( whimpering )

19
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,311
( panting, crying )

20
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:52,314
Ramsay:<i> — Tansy.</i>
Woman:<i> — Where is she?

21
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,617
Ramsay:<i> — Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!</i>
( barking )

22
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,072
( whimpering )

23
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:08,163
( screams )

24
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,837
( crying )

25
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,448
Good girls.
Down, girls.

26
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,483
Down.

27
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:22,518
Well done.
You, too.

28
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:26,014
— I only wounded her.
— You brought her down. That's what matters.

29
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:28,734
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

30
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,936
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

31
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:33,188
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

32
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,858
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

33
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,509
It will be over soon.

34
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:42,114
She thinks she's pretty.

35
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,665
Let me put one through her face.

36
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,250
We have to reward
the hounds, love.

37
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,416
They did all the hard work.

38
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:48,873
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

39
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,020
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

40
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,864
— Me jealous of her?
— <i> My lord, please.

41
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:57,596
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

42
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,598
— ( crying )
— ( dogs snarling, barking )

43
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,633
Rip her!
Rip her!

44
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,719
— Rip her!
— <i> ( Tansy screaming )

45
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,037
<i>( tearing )

46
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:08,184
Not so pretty now.

47
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:24,156
Tyrion: — <i>Your new hand, it's
nicer than the old one.

48
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,490
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

49
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,576
Is it solid gold?

50
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:30,629
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

51
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,581
Why is no one eating?

52
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,384
My wife wastes away and my
brother starves himself.

53
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,419
— I'm not hungry.
— You lost a hand,

54
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,755
not a stomach.

55
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,590
Try the boar.

56
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:44,643
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

57
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,930
A toast.

58
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:51,316
To the proud Lannister children.

59
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:54,236
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

60
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,887
— Oh!
— I'll clean it up.

61
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,940
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

62
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,078
It's only wine.

63
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,122
I can't fight anymore.

64
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:15,791
What about your left?

65
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:20,629
I can hold a sword, but all
my instincts are wrong.

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,764
How can I protect the king

67
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,466
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

68
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:27,135
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

69
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:30,055
Let others do the fighting.

70
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:33,275
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

71
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,694
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

72
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,863
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

73
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:41,149
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

74
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:44,536
With whom? You?
Men talk.

75
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,122
Soon as someone discovers I can't
fight, he'll tell everyone.

76
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,661
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

77
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:56,331
As it happens,
I have just the one.

78
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,176
My brother tells me you
can keep your mouth shut.

79
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:10,178
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

80
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,347
He tells me you shit gold

81
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:15,233
just like your father.

82
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,152
Is this place safe?

83
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,690
There's this knight, Leygood,

84
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,326
— got thunderbolts on his shield.
— Uh–huh.

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,862
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

86
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,197
She's a screamer, that one.

87
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,950
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

88
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:36,204
( whistles ) I've never
seen Valyrian steel before.

89
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:38,590
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

90
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,959
if you fight with
an edged blade,

91
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,178
I'll have to.

92
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:44,629
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,099
I'll have no one left to pay me.

94
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,850
( blade clatters )

95
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:51,219
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

96
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,776
Ah!

97
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,113
Bold warrior you are, attacking
a man when his guard's down.

98
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:03,448
Best time to attack a man.

99
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:07,486
Mind yourself.

100
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:11,907
— If I still had my right hand...
— Plan on growing it back?

101
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:28,306
Come on, then.

102
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,520
Man:
<i>Open the gates!

103
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:45,440
<i>Riders coming in!

104
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,412
( horse whinnies )

105
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:03,959
Man: — <i>Let's get these
horses seen to!

106
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,430
Father.
Welcome home.

107
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:12,551
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

108
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,636
A pleasure, Mother.

109
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:16,721
Hello.

110
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:19,441
Roose: — <i>See that the horses are
fed, watered, and rubbed down.

111
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:22,777
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

112
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,813
This way, my lady.

113
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:26,948
Where is your prize?

114
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,567
With the hounds.

115
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,204
I'll have a look at him.

116
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,828
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

117
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:42,664
Word travels.
How he screamed.

118
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,167
— You would have loved it.
— ( laughs )

119
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,344
Father.

120
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:06,655
What did you do to him?

121
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:10,992
I trained him.
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

122
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:13,662
You flayed him.

123
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:16,031
Peeled a few bits.

124
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,033
Removed a few others.

125
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,921
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

126
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:25,373
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

127
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,459
The flayed man
is on our banners.

128
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,344
My banners, not yours.

129
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,379
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

130
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,552
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

131
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,105
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

132
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:42,023
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

133
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,259
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.

134
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,562
Theon was a valuable
hostage, not your plaything.

135
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:51,032
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

136
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,867
I already asked.

137
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:56,371
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no–

138
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:59,407
You sent terms to Balon
Greyjoy without my consent?

139
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:01,493
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

140
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:02,994
I acted.

141
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:11,636
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

142
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,471
thanks to the Greyjoys.

143
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,473
I needed Theon.

144
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:17,425
I needed him whole.

145
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:20,929
Theon was our enemy.

146
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,981
But Reek,

147
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,850
Reek will never betray us.

148
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:29,604
I placed far too much
trust in you.

149
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:42,284
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

150
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:45,787
— <i> It's disrespectful.</i>
— I'm sorry, my lord.

151
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:50,125
Give him the razor.

152
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:01,219
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

153
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:10,895
Go on, Reek.

154
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:13,365
<i>A nice close shave.

155
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:37,088
Reek, tell Father

156
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,175
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

157
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,227
I don't know, my lord.

158
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:44,012
You murdered them

159
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:47,816
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

160
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,269
Ramsay:<i> — Reek,

161
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:53,521
did you murder the Stark boys?

162
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:55,740
No, my lord.

163
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,025
Just two farm boys.

164
00:11:57,076 --> 00:12:00,028
Ramsay: — <i>And crisped them
so no one would know.

165
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,697
Theon:
<i>Yes, my lord.

166
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,202
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

167
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,921
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

168
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:12,540
the country will rally
to their side

169
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,759
now that Robb Stark is gone.

170
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:19,798
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.

171
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,268
Robb Stark is dead.

172
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:26,054
<i>Sorry.

173
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:28,356
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.

174
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:31,309
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

175
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,731
How do you feel about that?

176
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,630
— You ready for a hunt?
— Always.

177
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:55,917
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

178
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,969
Your pet rat have any thoughts

179
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:00,221
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

180
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:04,392
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

181
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,762
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

182
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:09,147
Their bastard brother.

183
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,433
He could be sheltering them.

184
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,067
He may know where they are.

185
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:18,156
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

186
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,824
Could be a threat.

187
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,010
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

188
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:25,613
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

189
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:27,866
Bring this creature of yours.

190
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,202
Maybe he'll be of some use.

191
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,623
Take the Moat for the family,

192
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,342
for<i> our</i> family,

193
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,878
and I'll reconsider
your position.

194
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:46,434
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

195
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:49,771
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

196
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:52,607
— Oh, to be foreign.
— Ahem.

197
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,776
Shae has been noticed.

198
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,311
Sansa's maid saw you with her.

199
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,029
She already told your sister.

200
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,315
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

201
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:03,485
So I'm guilty of being seen
with my own wife's handmaiden.

202
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:05,320
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

203
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,988
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

204
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,740
No, I will not.

205
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,043
How long do you imagine your father
and sister would let me live

206
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,412
if they suspected me of lying?

207
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:16,831
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

208
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:18,917
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

209
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,386
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.

210
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,204
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

211
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,257
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

212
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:29,427
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

213
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:30,979
She won't leave.

214
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,263
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

215
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,182
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

216
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,185
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

217
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:40,772
Have you ever known your
father to make an idle threat?

218
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,994
From House Tyrell and the
people of the Reach,

219
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:50,198
Your Grace, it is my honor to
present you with this wedding cup.

220
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,784
May you and my daughter Margaery

221
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:54,619
drink deep and live long.

222
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,038
A handsome goblet, my lord.

223
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:59,707
Or shall I call you Father?

224
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:02,293
I shall be honored, Your Grace.

225
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:12,036
She's the whore
I told you about.

226
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,888
The dark-haired one.

227
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:18,560
Have her brought to the Tower
of the Hand before the wedding.

228
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,405
A book?

229
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,874
«The Lives of Four Kings.»
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

230
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:35,209
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

231
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:39,714
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the
Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

232
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,416
A book every king should read.

233
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,594
Now that the war is won,

234
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,813
we should all find
time for wisdom.

235
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,100
Thank you, Uncle.

236
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:13,364
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

237
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:17,285
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

238
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:34,118
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

239
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:36,437
So they say.

240
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:46,481
( panting )

241
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,034
Such a great sword
should have a name.

242
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,870
— What shall I call her?
— Man:<i> Stormbringer.

243
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,039
— Man #2:<i> Terminus.</i>
— Man #3:<i> Widow's Wail.

244
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:57,575
— Man #4:<i> Wolfsbane.</i>
— Widow's Wail. I like that.

245
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,911
( chuckles )

246
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,996
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

247
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:03,665
Ned Stark's head all over again.

248
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,689
<i>( door opens )

249
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,911
Don't.

250
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,999
You want me on the desk?

251
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,671
— <i> What's wrong, my lion?</i>
— Don't call me that.

252
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:46,374
What should I call you?

253
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:49,377
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

254
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,179
Our friendship?

255
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,548
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

256
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:55,800
What?

257
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:57,268
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

258
00:17:57,302 --> 00:18:01,689
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

259
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,392
What is this?

260
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,611
I'm a married man.

261
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:09,530
My wife has suffered a great
deal, as you well know.

262
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:12,700
<i>I don't want her to suffer
anymore on my account.

263
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:14,902
I need to uphold my vows.

264
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:17,572
She doesn't want you.

265
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:20,241
— <i> I need to do right by her.</i>
— You don't want her.

266
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,959
By our children.

267
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:26,330
— What are you afraid of?
— I'm not afraid.

268
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:29,751
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

269
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:32,470
— You're going to run from them all your life?
— I need you to leave.

270
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:35,506
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

271
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:37,892
— Shae.
— We will fight them together.

272
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,261
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

273
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,430
You're a whore!

274
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,652
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

275
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,154
I can't be in love with a whore.

276
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,607
I can't have children
with a whore.

277
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,326
How many men have you been with?

278
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,612
500? 5,000?

279
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,903
How many whores
have you been with?

280
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,089
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

281
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:10,208
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

282
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,543
But now that time is over.

283
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:18,432
<i>( Shae crying )

284
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,529
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

285
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,400
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

289
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,983
and lead us from the darkness.

00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:13,237
Sire, I served you well.

Did you see?
Their souls.

300
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,937
It was their souls.

301
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,023
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

302
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,566
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

303
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:00,902
He was an infidel.

304
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,404
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

305
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,573
and their fathers before him.

306
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,242
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

307
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:10,578
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

308
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,079
He disobeyed.

309
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,415
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

310
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,716
How many men?

311
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:18,085
A good deal more than you.

312
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:21,389
Did you see, Ser Davos?

313
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:22,723
They're with our lord now.

314
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,259
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

315
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,979
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

316

( sniffs )

317
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,028
Meat's off.

318
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:47,782
Our larders are almost empty.

319
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,867
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

320
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,452
You hate fish.

321
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:54,288
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

322
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:59,710
When Storm's End was under
siege and I was starving,

323
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:03,848
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.

324
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:06,968
The binding glue
is made from horses.

325
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:14,525
One morning, he shot two
seagulls on the beach.

326
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,229
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

327
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,983
— Do you remember?
— Of course I remember.

328
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:27,288
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

329
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:29,490
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child.

330
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,709
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

331
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:34,295
Until he found me.

332
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:43,421
I fear for our daughter's soul.

333
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,008
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.

334
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,176
— She's a stubborn little beast.
— She's a child.

335
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,312
You barely know her.

336
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:54,181
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

337
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:56,517
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

338
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,570
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

339
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,155
She needs the rod.

340
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:04,658
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

341
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,695
As you command.

342
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:12,199
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

343
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:18,506
<i>( knocks )

344
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,592
Come in.

345
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,047
Were you sleeping, Princess?

346
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:33,054
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

347
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:35,473
I heard it.

348
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,108
And it frightened you?

349
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:39,026
Ser Axel was my uncle.

350
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,312
<i>He was always kind to me.

351
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:43,314
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

352
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:46,200
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.

353
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,818
But they screamed.

354
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,870
Women scream
when they give birth.

355
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,490
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

356
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,208
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

357
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:56,243
You have so many
questions, don't you?

358
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:58,462
<i>So did I when I was a child.

359
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:00,831
I was much like you.

360
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:03,467
Only I wasn't a princess.

361
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,086
And you didn't have this.

362
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,971
No.

363
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:09,924
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

364
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:12,343
What do you know of the gods?

365
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:14,645
I read
«The Seven-Pointed Star.»

366
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,431
Lies and fables.

367
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:20,518
Septons speak of seven gods.

368
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:22,103
There are but two–

369
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:24,522
a god of light and love and joy

370
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:28,192
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

371
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:29,944
Eternally at war.

372
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:33,998
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

373
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,785
There's only one hell, Princess.

374
00:24:37,787 --> 00:24:40,955
The one we live in now.

375
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:43,707
<i>( heavy breathing )

— ( breathing heavily )

378
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:23,497
Why did you wake me?

379
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:26,467
You've been gone for hours.

380
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:28,135
I was hungry.

381
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,221
We're all hungry.

382
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,972
I was just eating.

383
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:35,009
Summer was eating.

384
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:38,012
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

385
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:41,182
<i>Spending too much time in
Summer's skin is dangerous.

386
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,568
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

387
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,523
Must be glorious, though.

388
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:53,244
To run, to leap, to hunt.

389
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,263
To be whole.

392
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,254
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

393
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:09,376
You'd forget us, Bran.

394
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:11,295
You'd forget your mother
and father.

395
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:13,347
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

396
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,099
You'd forget Winterfell.

397
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:17,051
You'd forget you.

398
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:21,222

we lose everything.

Better her than you.

— Bit much, wouldn't you say?
— It feels proportionate.

00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:12,619
— Proportionate to what?
— The expected extravagance.

423

People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

424

tend not to have it for long.

425
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:19,960
You ought to try enjoying
something before you die.

You might find it suits you.

Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin

Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

to commemorate your generosity?

432
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:36,643
No, your heartfelt thank-you
is its own reward.

I would imagine I'd be hearing

Almost as much as you

You saw the ship sail away?

No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

How do you know?

Because if someone follows

I'm the last person
they ever follow.

There's someone following you?

She's gone.

I know you don't want to
believe it, but she is.

Now, go drink till it feels

You look exquisite, child.

00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:11,238
The wind has been
at you, though.

457
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:14,408
I haven't had the
opportunity to tell you

458

how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

459
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:20,747
War is war, but killing
a man at a wedding,

460
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:22,382
horrid.

461
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:24,635
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

462
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:28,138
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

463
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:29,673
My lady.
My lady.

464
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:32,976
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

465
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,678
Perhaps if your pauper husband

466
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:37,264
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

467
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:40,601
he might be able to afford to bring
you to Highgarden for a visit.

468

Now that peace has come and
all is right with the world,

it would do you good

You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:34,571
Everyone.

481
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:38,408
The queen would like
to say a few words.

482
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:41,828
( applause )

483
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,801
We are so fortunate

484
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:50,053
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

485
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,589
Not all among us are so lucky.

486
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,560
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

487
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:59,896
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

488
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:03,650
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

489
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:06,903
— ( applause )
— <i> ( music playing )

490
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,531
You're an example to us all.

491
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:35,799
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

492
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,517
Ser Loras, it's quite all right.

493
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,222
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

494
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:43,807
Loras:
<i>As does yours.

495
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:46,893
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

496
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:49,279
Yes, very much.

497
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:51,698
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

498
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,233
They certainly are.

499
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,534
Perhaps they should get married.

500
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,703
( laughs )

501
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:59,156
If you were to marry Cersei,

502
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,791
she'd murder you in your sleep.

503
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:04,544
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

504
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,713
she'd murder him, too,

505
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:08,415
long before he drew
his first breath.

506
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:11,585
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

507
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:14,221
because you'll never marry her.

508
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,176
And neither will you.

509
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,858
Your Grace.
My king.

510
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,777
— My queen.
— Lady Brienne.

511
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:39,079
So good of you to come.

512
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,530
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

513
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:42,949
Did you just bow?

514
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,451
Apologies, Your Grace.

515
00:35:44,502 --> 00:35:47,254
I never did master the curtsy.

516
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:48,872
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

517
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:51,875
That's not true, my love. Brienne
had nothing to do with it.

518
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,627
A shame.

519
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,296
I'd knight the man that put an
end to that deviant's life.

520
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,599
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

521
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:00,984
and wish you good fortune.

522
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,936
The country has been
at war too long.

523
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,189
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

524
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:08,041
— Yes, yes.
— Thank you.

525
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:10,260
I hope we see more of you.

526
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:19,119
Lady Brienne.

527
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:21,988
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

528
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,991
That makes you a lady whether
you want to be or not.

529
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:27,294
As you say, Your Grace.

530
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:28,745
I owe you my gratitude.

531
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:31,081
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

532
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:35,919
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

533
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,687
More than once.

534
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:39,840
Did he?

535
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:42,509
Haven't heard that story before.

536
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:46,680
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

537
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:49,099
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

538
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,253
Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to
Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

539
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:56,773
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

540
00:36:56,824 --> 00:36:59,576
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

541
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,162
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

542
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,331
But you love him.

543
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,291
Your Grace.

544
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:28,889
No, no, come to my chambers and
I will examine you personally.

545
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:31,191
— She'll do no such thing.
— Oh, Your Grace.

546
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:33,393
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice–

547
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:35,111
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

548
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:38,231
— Your Grace.
— Qyburn? Deplorable man.

549
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:41,701
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

550
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:44,070
More repugnant than your gnarled
fingers on that girl's thighs?

551
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:46,456
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

552
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,292
My little brother had you sent to the
Black Cells when you annoyed him.

553
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:51,411
What do you think I could do
to you if you annoyed me?

554
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,413
I never meant to annoy anyone.

555
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:56,333
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

556
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:58,551
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

557
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,086
So here's what I want you to do.

558
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,638
I want you to leave my presence.

559
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,089
Leave this wedding right now.

560
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,758
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

561
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:08,261
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

562
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:10,513
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery–

563
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:12,899
The<i> queen</i> is telling you

564
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:15,185
the leftovers will feed the dogs

565
00:38:15,236 --> 00:38:17,437
or you will.

566
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,292
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

567
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:41,594
( crowd laughing )

568
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:53,139
You're in rather a good mood.

569
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:55,475
— I suppose I am.
— I won't ask why.

570
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:58,695
— Small pleasures.
— Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

571
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:00,280
Prince Oberyn.

572
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:01,648
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

573
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,400
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

574
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:05,819
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

575
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,571
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

576
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:11,992
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

577
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:16,079
— Ellaria Sand.
— My lord. My lady.

578
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,831
Charmed.

579
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:20,050
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

580
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,422
We are everywhere in Dorne.

581
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:27,807
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

582
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:30,260
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

583
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:31,678
We don't despise them in Dorne.

584
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:32,929
No?
How tolerant of you.

585
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,015
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

586
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:37,734
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

587
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:40,904
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

588
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:42,939
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

589
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,908
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

590
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:47,277
Please give him our regards.

591
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:49,029
With any luck,
the gout will abate

592
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,697
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

593
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:52,665
They call it
the rich man's disease.

594
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,034
A wonder you don't have it.

595
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:55,952
Noblemen in my part
of the country

596
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:59,072
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

597
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,957
People everywhere
have their differences.

598
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:04,210
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

599
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:07,547
In other places the rape and
murder of women and children

600
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:09,516
is considered distasteful.

601
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:14,771
What a fortunate thing for
you, former Queen Regent,

602
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:16,773
that your daughter
Myrcella has been sent

603
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:19,142
to live in the latter
sort of place.

<i>( taps goblet )

605

Everyone, silence!
Clear the floor.

606
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:32,405
There's been too much
amusement here today.

607
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:36,292
A royal wedding
is not an amusement.

608
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:39,295
A royal wedding is history.

609
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,831
The time has come for all of us

610
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:44,300
to contemplate our history.

Though you're not

A true champion defeats

This one is clearly
mad with lust.

It would be a tragedy for
the king to lose his virtue

672

seeing as you're
too cowardly to fight.

Your Grace does me
a great honor.
